  <string id="6000680">It used to be we never got visitors to the Wilds, but now it seems they arrive in hordes!</string>
  <string id="6000681">I don't know what you are, but I won't let you harm us!</string>
  <string id="6000682">Come no closer!</string>
  <string id="6000689">Let me? If I wished you harm, I daresay you could not stop me.</string>
  <string id="6000692">I don't know what we would have done if you hadn't arrived.</string>
  <string id="6000693">Thank you for saving us.</string>
  <string id="6000700">I do! You would have perished. You still may.</string>
  <string id="6000703">Impressive. Where'd you learn how to turn into a dragon?</string>
  <string id="6000704">Nice trick.</string>
  <string id="6000708">Perhaps I am a dragon.</string>
  <string id="6000711">If so, count yourself lucky. The smell of burning darkspawn does nothing for the appetite.</string>
  <string id="6000714">If you wish to flee the darkspawn, you should know you are heading in the wrong direction.</string>
  <string id="6000717">Wait! You can't just leave us here!</string>
  <string id="6000720">So you're just going to leave us here?</string>
  <string id="6000723">Can I not?</string>
  <string id="6000726">I spotted a most curious sight: a mighty ogre, vanquished! Who could perform such a feat?</string>
  <string id="6000729">But now my curiosity is sated, and you are safe... for the moment. Is that not enough?</string>
  <string id="6000730">We can get to Kirkwall on our own.</string>
  <string id="6000731">We're fine.</string>
  <string id="6000738">Is it fate or chance? I can never decide.</string>
  <string id="6000741">It appears fortune smiles on us both today. I may be able to help you yet.</string>
  <string id="6000747">Perhaps you do not, but it turns out I need you.</string>
  <string id="6000753">There is always a catch. Life is a catch! I suggest you catch it while you can!</string>
  <string id="6000762">Maybe we shouldn't trust her. I don't even know what she is.</string>
  <string id="6000765">Should we even trust her? We don't even know what she is!</string>
  <string id="6000768">I know what she is. The Witch of the Wilds.</string>
  <string id="6000771">Some call me that. Also Flemeth. Asha'bellanar. An old hag who talks too much!</string>
  <string id="6000774">Does it matter? I offer you this: I will get your group past the horde in exchange for a simple delivery to a place not far out of your way. Would you do this for a Witch of the Wilds?</string>
  <string id="6000784">Should we trust her?</string>
  <string id="6000785">What do the rest of you think?</string>
  <string id="6000792">What is a Witch of the Wilds, exactly?</string>
  <string id="6000793">Witch of the Wilds?</string>
  <string id="6000794">How much trouble will this delivery be, exactly?</string>
  <string id="6000795">What will we be facing?</string>
  <string id="6000796">You would go through all that trouble to have something delivered?</string>
  <string id="6000797">Why not go yourself?</string>
  <string id="6000798">I have to reach Kirkwall first.</string>
  <string id="6000799">I can't guarantee delivery.</string>
  <string id="6000800">We don't have much choice.</string>
  <string id="6000801">Agreed.</string>
  <string id="6000802">Roast a few more darkspawn, I'll do anything you want!</string>
  <string id="6000803">We could use more fire.</string>
  <string id="6000804">We won't be able to get through the darkspawn on our own.</string>
  <string id="6000805">We need to get out of here.</string>
  <string id="6000809">They are everywhere or soon will be. Where is it you plan to run to, hmm?</string>
  <string id="6000812">We need to get to Kirkwall—in the Free Marches.</string>
  <string id="6000815">You could show me that trick of yours. That looks useful.</string>
  <string id="6000816">I want to be a dragon.</string>
  <string id="6000820">Laughs</string>
  <string id="6000823">I daresay it is! Such a clever tongue for a mage!</string>
  <string id="6000826">If only a clever tongue was all one needed!</string>
  <string id="6000829">Tell me, clever child: how do you intend to outrun the Blight?</string>
  <string id="6000861">Wesley is injured. We'll never escape the darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6000864">If you need to, leave me behind.</string>
  <string id="6000867">No! I said I would drag you out if I had to, and I meant it!</string>
  <string id="6000874">A Chasind legend. Witches that steal children.</string>
  <string id="6000877">Bah! As if I had nothing better to do!</string>
  <string id="6000880">You're an apostate?</string>
  <string id="6000883">Yes. Just like you.</string>
  <string id="6000884">Then you're an apostate.</string>
  <string id="6000887">As it so happens.</string>
  <string id="6000888">Yes, we have so much in common!</string>
  <string id="6000892">About as much trouble as my saving your lives not five minutes ago.</string>
  <string id="6000893">We didn't ask you for anything.</string>
  <string id="6000894">We would have been fine.</string>
  <string id="6000898">Of course. My mistake!</string>
  <string id="6000899">That's a lot to ask without telling us what this involves.</string>
  <string id="6000900">We need to know details.</string>
  <string id="6000904">It's nothing more dangerous than one so capable can handle.</string>
  <string id="6000905">Good point.</string>
  <string id="6000906">You got me there.</string>
  <string id="6000910">If you knew my daughter, you'd know how seldom I hear that.</string>
  <string id="6000914">I have... an appointment to keep.</string>
  <string id="6000917">It is far more convenient this way. Happily, you're not without your own needs.</string>
  <string id="6000921">But you will do it.</string>
  <string id="6000927">We never do.</string>
  <string id="6000930">There is a clan of Dalish elves near the city of Kirkwall. Deliver this amulet to their Keeper, Marethari.</string>
  <string id="6000934">Sadly, my charity is at an end.</string>
  <string id="6000941">Do as she asks with it and any debt between us is paid in full.</string>
  <string id="6000947">Before I take you anywhere, however, there is another matter...</string>
  <string id="6000950">No! Leave him alone!</string>
  <string id="6000953">What has been done to your man is within his blood already.</string>
  <string id="6000956">You lie!</string>
  <string id="6000959">She's right, Aveline. I can feel the corruption inside me.</string>
  <string id="6000960">What are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="6000961">What corruption?</string>
  <string id="6000962">From the darkspawn. All that blood. I knew... when it happened.</string>
  <string id="6000963">There must be something we can do.</string>
  <string id="6000964">We have to help him!</string>
  <string id="6000965">The only cure I know of is to become a Grey Warden.</string>
  <string id="6000968">And they all died at Ostagar.</string>
  <string id="6000971">Not all, but the last are now beyond your reach.</string>
  <string id="6000974">Aveline. Listen to me.</string>
  <string id="6000977">You can't ask me this! I won't!</string>
  <string id="6000980">Please. The corruption is a slow death. I can't...</string>
  <string id="6000981">He's your husband, Aveline. I can't decide his fate.</string>
  <string id="6000982">It's up to you.</string>
  <string id="6000989">Whatever you're going to do, do it. We can't wait.</string>
  <string id="6000990">Put him out of his misery.</string>
  <string id="6001000">And they all died at Ostagar.</string>
  <string id="6001003">This corruption is the permanent sort, I take it?</string>
  <string id="6001004">Sounds bad.</string>
  <string id="6001005">Not long now, if I am any judge.</string>
  <string id="6001008">We can't afford that kind of liability.</string>
  <string id="6001009">Leave him.</string>
  <string id="6001013">No!</string>
  <string id="6001022">Be strong, my love.</string>
  <string id="6001034">Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6001043">Without an end, there can be no peace.</string>
  <string id="6001046">It gets no easier. Your struggles have only just begun.</string>
  <string id="6001094">I'm sorry, Aveline. This has to be done.</string>
  <string id="6001095">I'll do it.</string>
  <string id="6001162">They're almost on top of us, Brother.</string>
  <string id="6001165">They're almost on top of us, Brother.</string>
  <string id="6001171">They're almost on top of us, Sister.</string>
  <string id="6001174">They're almost on top of us, Sister.</string>
  <string id="6001177">We will have to fight them sooner or later.</string>
  <string id="6001183">Then we make our stand here. Prepare yourself.</string>
  <string id="6001189">We can't keep this up forever.</string>
  <string id="6001190">We can't keep this up forever.</string>
  <string id="6001191">We'll take the bastards down with us.</string>
  <string id="6001192">Then we fight.</string>
  <string id="6001193">We'll make it through this—together.</string>
  <string id="6001194">I'm right beside you.</string>
  <string id="6001195">Perhaps we'll be lucky and they'll run out of darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6001196">Neither can they.</string>
  <string id="6001197">Here they come. Shall I give them a taste of my blade?</string>
  <string id="6001198">All yours, Brother.</string>
  <string id="6001199">Do it.</string>
  <string id="6001201">Here they come. Shall I deal with them?</string>
  <string id="6001202">Allow me.</string>
  <string id="6001203">I'll deal with them.</string>
  <string id="6001211">All yours, Sister.</string>
  <string id="6001212">Do it.</string>
  <string id="6001219">What is that?</string>
  <string id="6001220">What is that?</string>
  <string id="6001226">There's no end to them...</string>
  <string id="6001227">There's no end to them...</string>
  <string id="6001230">Well, well, what have we here?</string>
  <string id="6001238">The Blight had been unleashed on Ferelden.</string>
  <string id="6001241">The battle was a disaster.</string>
  <string id="6001253">Unopposed, the horde marched on the village of Lothering.</string>
  <string id="6001259">The Champion's family barely escaped in time...</string>
  <string id="6001262">Bullshit. That's not what really happened!</string>
  <string id="6001265">Does that not match the story you've heard, Seeker?</string>
  <string id="6001280">You'll need to hear the whole story.</string>
  <string id="6001287">Your king will not miss you, hmm?</string>
  <string id="6001289">So far... simply to flee the darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6001293">We will have to fight them sooner or later.</string>
  <string id="6001332">Lothering is gone, and Ferelden may soon follow. We have to go.</string>
  <string id="6001333">Our home was just destroyed.</string>
  <string id="6001334">King Cailan was betrayed. There's nothing for me here.</string>
  <string id="6001335">He is dead.</string>
  <string id="6001336">I'm sure he'll miss his life more.</string>
  <string id="6001337">He has no opinion.</string>
  <string id="6001344">Our home is gone, but I don't imagine you care.</string>
  <string id="6001345">We have nowhere else.</string>
  <string id="6001348">Any better suggestions? I hear the Deep Roads are vacant now.</string>
  <string id="6001349">How far do you recommend?</string>
  <string id="6001350">Laughs Oh, you I like!</string>
  <string id="6001353">Our home is gone, and we have nowhere else to go.</string>
  <string id="6001354">We have family there.</string>
  <string id="6001355">I see.</string>
  <string id="6001358">Hurtled into the chaos, you fight... and the world will shake before you.</string>
  <string id="6001819">Select a follower:</string>

  <string id="6001897">We could use the help.</string>
  <string id="6001898">There must be a catch.</string>
  <string id="6001899">Just like that?</string>
  <string id="6002005">At least we're alive. That's no small feat.</string>

  <string id="6004376">Now the templars run it and use it to lock up their mages. Guess not much has changed.</string>
  <string id="6004377">Are mages imprisoned here?</string>
  <string id="6004378">They lock up the mages?</string>
  <string id="6004379">Well, no more so than anywhere else. It's a Circle of Magi now.</string>
  <string id="6004385">Magic is to serve man, not rule him, and mages are better locked up where they don't hurt anyone.</string>
  <string id="6004402">If it were up to me, I'd bar the gates and let you find somewhere else to beg.</string>
  <string id="6004405">So Knight-Commander Meredith wants us to sort you all out. Most of you are getting right back on your ships, though.</string>
  <string id="6004406">That's a templar title. Why would a city guardsman answer to the templars?</string>
  <string id="6004407">Knight-Commander Meredith?</string>
  <string id="6004408">We don't answer to her... but she's the power in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6004411">Don't know what would happen if the viscount went against something she wanted...</string>
  <string id="6004414">But he's sure never taken that chance.</string>

  <string id="6004645">I can finish this!</string>
  <string id="6004649">I need help with this one!</string>
  <string id="6004650">Someone give me a hand here!</string>
  <string id="6004651">Over here!</string>
  <string id="6004652">Help me with this!</string>
  <string id="6004869">Stay together! Don't get separated!</string>
  <string id="6004870">Everyone regroup!</string>
  <string id="6004876">Head over there!</string>
  <string id="6004879">Maybe something else...</string>
  <string id="6004880">Ooh. That didn't work like I thought.</string>
  <string id="6004883">I hope we have more of these.</string>
  <string id="6004888">I'm stuck!</string>
  <string id="6004889">What the— I can't move!</string>
  <string id="6004890">Well, this is just peachy...</string>
  <string id="6004893">I can't keep casting forever, you know!</string>
  <string id="6004894">What, do you think I'm made of mana?</string>
  <string id="6004895">Sighs That's all I got.</string>
  <string id="6004898">Help! Somebody? Anybody?</string>
  <string id="6004899">I can't take much more...</string>
  <string id="6004900">Oh, this doesn't look good...</string>
  <string id="6004901">Ugh, this potion smells like fish!</string>
  <string id="6004902">Ooh! I feel better now!</string>
  <string id="6004905">I got one!</string>
  <string id="6004906">Ha! That'll teach you!</string>
  <string id="6004907">There's probably a lesson here about the dangers of magic.</string>
  <string id="6004910">This isn't working!</string>
  <string id="6004911">I think we need to try something else!</string>
  <string id="6004914">I can't hit that.</string>
  <string id="6004915">I work magic, not miracles.</string>
  <string id="6004918">There's more of them!</string>
  <string id="6004919">I think they called for help.</string>
  <string id="6004920">Maker's breath! More!</string>
  <string id="6004923">Watch out!</string>
  <string id="6004924">Here we go!</string>
  <string id="6004925">They're trying to kill us!</string>
  <string id="6004928">Ugh. Thanks. Things looked bad there.</string>
  <string id="6004929">My whole life flashed before my eyes... I need to get out more.</string>
  <string id="6004930">Let's not do that again.</string>
  <string id="6004931">That'll leave a mark.</string>
  <string id="6004932">That's too far away.</string>
  <string id="6005015">What kind of man is this Meeran?</string>
  <string id="6005016">Tell me about this mercenary.</string>
  <string id="6005017">He's a hired sword. What do you expect him to be like?</string>
  <string id="6005026">I wouldn't bring him home for dinner or anything, but he's got a decent reputation. I wouldn't have asked him if I thought he'd cross you.</string>
  <string id="6005030">How dangerous is this smuggler's work?</string>
  <string id="6005031">Tell me about this smuggler.</string>
  <string id="6005032">Well, it won't be pretty working for her. She's a pretty small fish compared to some of the other thieves' guilds around here.</string>
  <string id="6005038">But she's tough, she's fair and she never deals in slaves or flesh.</string>
  <string id="6005048">What do you think about this, Bethany?</string>
  <string id="6005049">Bethany?</string>
  <string id="6005056">We've come this far. I don't care who we work for, as long as it means we don't have to go back.</string>
  <string id="6005057">Let's find them and see what they have to say.</string>
  <string id="6005058">I'll go talk to them.</string>
  <string id="6005082">I owe you one.</string>
  <string id="6005083">You are officially my favorite person.</string>
  <string id="6005084">If it didn't hurt to breathe right now, I'd hug you.</string>
  <string id="6005087">Aveline's down!</string>
  <string id="6005089">Anders! Help is on its way!</string>
  <string id="6005090">Merrill!</string>
  <string id="6005091">Someone help Varric!</string>
  <string id="6005094">My brother! Oh, you're going to regret that.</string>
  <string id="6005096">They got Fenris!</string>
  <string id="6005097">Isabela's hurt!</string>
  <string id="6005099">Nobody picks on my friends and gets away with it!</string>
  <string id="6005100">You'll be sorry you did that!</string>
  <string id="6005291">That's where their ship landed with all the rest.</string>
  <string id="6005292">Thus began the Champion's first year in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6005295">Word arrived from across the sea that the Hero of Ferelden had defeated the Blight.</string>
  <string id="6005304">But Lothering was destroyed. Kirkwall was the Champion's home now.</string>
  <string id="6005310">It was a busy year in the city. That's when the Qunari landed.</string>
  <string id="6005313">A great storm caught their ship and left hundreds of warriors stranded in the city, waiting to return home.</string>
  <string id="6005316">That’s also when the trouble began with the mages.</string>
  <string id="6005322">The templars had become very powerful under Knight-Commander Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6005326">But most importantly, that's when I first met the Champion.</string>
  <string id="6005334">Are you afraid to fight a little girl?</string>
  <string id="6005335">Show me what you've got!</string>
  <string id="6005336">Bet you can't hit me!</string>
  <string id="6005341">I've got you covered!</string>
  <string id="6005342">Don't worry, I'll help!</string>
  <string id="6005343">Nothing to worry about...</string>
  <string id="6005381">You want in, talk to Captain Ewald. I'm just here to keep you refuse from climbing the walls.</string>
  <string id="6005394">We're not animals you can just corral!</string>
  <string id="6005397">We've no intention of keeping anyone here, serah. You're all going back where you came from.</string>
  <string id="6005400">My men and I fought against the Blight. We're heroes!</string>
  <string id="6005403">Deserters, you mean. It doesn't matter. Kirkwall has no more room for anyone.</string>
  <string id="6005404">What do you want? Money? I can pay you.</string>
  <string id="6005407">All the gold in Thedas won't make the city any larger.</string>
  <string id="6005413">Don't give us that shit! Where are we supposed to go?</string>
  <string id="6005416">I don't know, serah, but there's nothing for you here.</string>
  <string id="6005625">Outside Lothering</string>
  <string id="6005629">Aveline</string>
  <string id="6005640">Flemeth</string>
  <string id="6005643">No admittance. Orders of the viscount.</string>
  <string id="6005644">You're wasting your time; there's nothing here for you.</string>
  <string id="6005645">Just take your things and get back on the ship.</string>
  <string id="6005654">Guardsman Wright</string>
  <string id="6005658">Captain Ewald</string>
  <string id="6005664">Gamlen</string>
  <string id="6005668">City Guardsman</string>
  <string id="6005672">Merchant Cavril</string>
  <string id="6005676">Mother</string>
  <string id="6005692">Refugee</string>
  <string id="6005696">Refugee</string>
  <string id="6005700">Varric</string>
  <string id="6005704">Wesley</string>
  <string id="6005708">Cassandra</string>
  <string id="6005719">What if Uncle Gamlen's not waiting for us? What if he didn't get Mother's letter? Oh Maker... this isn't helping...</string>
  <string id="6005722">How will we find anyone in this place?</string>
  <string id="6005731">Be ready for anything. I'm sure there's more trouble to come.</string>
  <string id="6005734">Don't look back! Just keep going!</string>
  <string id="6005754">Leandra! Damn, girl, the years haven't been kind to you.</string>
  <string id="6005757">Let me say up front, I wasn't expecting this. The Blight, your husband dead... I'd, ah, figured you'd pretty much be Fereldan for life.</string>
  <string id="6005763">Oh, Gamlen. We came too late. My poor Carver didn't make it, Andraste guide him.</string>
  <string id="6005764">Oh, Gamlen, we came too late. My darling Bethany didn't make it, Andraste guide her.</string>
  <string id="6005771">Oh, Maker save me. Leandra, don't drop this on me here. I don't even know if I can help you get in.</string>
  <string id="6005774">There are other ways to get into a city.</string>
  <string id="6005775">Then I'll get us in.</string>
  <string id="6005776">I'm more concerned about Mother. Can you get her in, at least?</string>
  <string id="6005777">What about Mother?</string>
  <string id="6005778">Would it help if I said you were my favorite uncle?</string>
  <string id="6005779">What if I ask nicely?</string>
  <string id="6005808">No. We stay together!</string>
  <string id="6005809">It'd make me feel better, but that's about it.</string>
  <string id="6005818">I was hoping to grease some palms, but the knight-commander's been cracking down. We're gonna need more grease.</string>
  <string id="6005821">Not quite. I know some people who might help... if you're not too delicate about the company you keep.</string>
  <string id="6005822">Do we need to stay in Kirkwall? Let's go to another city.</string>
  <string id="6005823">Why don't we just leave?</string>
  <string id="6005826">What do you mean exactly, Gamlen?</string>
  <string id="6005827">Sounds suspicious.</string>
  <string id="6005828">We don't have any choice, do we? I need to get my family into Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6005829">We can't stay here.</string>
  <string id="6005830">Let's hear it, Uncle. What do you have in mind?</string>
  <string id="6005831">Sounds like fun.</string>
  <string id="6005832">CUTSCENE: Lots of darkspawn arrive. A high dragon appears, burning the darkspawn and landing. The dragon changes into Flemeth.</string>
  <string id="6005833">CUTSCENE: Telling about the battle of Ostagar and how the player ended up being just outside Lothering with his family, trying to escape.</string>
  <string id="6005834">CUTSCENE: Tells how the player traveled the sea to Kirkwall, ending up in the Gallows with many refugees.</string>
  <string id="6005835">CUTSCENE: Prologue ends. Act 1 intro: summary of the player's first year in Kirkwall - mentions the Qunari arriving and some tension between mages and templars. The players works for either mercenaries or criminals.</string>
  <string id="6005908">Don't worry, I'll keep an eye out for trouble.</string>
  <string id="6005911">Get your breath while you can.</string>
  <string id="6006065">Take point. I'll be rear guard.</string>
  <string id="6006068">Keep sharp!</string>
  <string id="6006072">I'll keep watch if you need to stop for a moment.</string>
  <string id="6006073">Stay close.</string>
  <string id="6006076">So much destruction...</string>
  <string id="6006077">Stop squirming, Wesley. You'll make it worse.</string>
  <string id="6006245">We need to find your uncle. With any luck, he's received my letter.</string>
  <string id="6006251">I'm not sure we can survive much more of this.</string>
  <string id="6006254">I never intended to stay so long, but this has become home.</string>
  <string id="6006284">Maker save us, we've lost it all. Everything your father and I built...</string>
  <string id="6007072">The Destruction of Lothering</string>
  <string id="6007717">Blessed Andraste, guide our fallen to the Maker's side.</string>
  <string id="6007718">Such destruction. Maker forgive us. This should have been prevented.</string>
  <string id="6007719">I can't believe the darkspawn have reached this far so quickly.</string>
  <string id="6007722">Look out!</string>
  <string id="6007723">Maker, watch over them. Keep them safe.</string>
  <string id="6007724">Keep your distance! Their blood is poison!</string>
  <string id="6007744">Can we keep going? I don't want to be a standing target.</string>
  <string id="6007838">Bethany</string>
  <string id="6007842">Carver</string>
  <string id="6007857">Find a way past the darkspawn horde.</string>
  <string id="6007863">What would you like to do?</string>
  <string id="6007864">Jump to Flemeth's fake rescue</string>
  <string id="6007865">Jump to Flemeth's fake rescue</string>
  <string id="6007866">Exit</string>
  <string id="6007867">Exit</string>
  <string id="6007952">CUTSCENE: Lothering is shown burning,  far away.</string>
  <string id="6007990">That was the worst nap I have ever had.</string>
  <string id="6007991">Clearly, I need to work on dodging.</string>
  <string id="6007992">Can we not do that again?</string>
  <string id="6007993">That was harder than I thought.</string>
  <string id="6007997">I don't think I can help you with that.</string>
  <string id="6007998">Don't look at me! I can't do that.</string>
  <string id="6007999">I think we're out of luck.</string>
  <string id="6008051">Ouch! Can we stop for a minute?</string>
  <string id="6008052">I know we're in a hurry... but I don't feel so good.</string>
  <string id="6008053">Anybody have some bandages? I better take care of this.</string>
  <string id="6008054">I think it's over.</string>
  <string id="6008055">Whew! We made it!</string>
  <string id="6008056">You know, that was almost fun.</string>
  <string id="6008057">Let's do this again some time.</string>
  <string id="6008058">Jump to real blightlands</string>
  <string id="6008059">Jump to real blightlands</string>
  <string id="6008124">That's enough out of you!</string>
  <string id="6008125">I'll make this quick!</string>
  <string id="6008126">You'll have to be faster than that!</string>
  <string id="6008130">Someone want to give me a hand with this?</string>
  <string id="6008131">Anyone feel like jumping in on this?</string>
  <string id="6008132">First person to help me out here is my new best friend!</string>
  <string id="6008133">All right, I might be out of my league here...</string>
  <string id="6008137">Fall in over here!</string>
  <string id="6008138">Nobody wander off!</string>
  <string id="6008139">Get into position!</string>
  <string id="6008144">Sorry about this, sweetheart.</string>
  <string id="6008148">I hope this works...</string>
  <string id="6008149">Does this stuff have side effects?</string>
  <string id="6008150">Just give me a second, here.</string>
  <string id="6008161">Oh, for the love of— These are my new boots!</string>
  <string id="6008162">I'm... huh, I'm stuck.</string>
  <string id="6008163">Sodding... I can't move!</string>
  <string id="6008167">Can we wrap this up... sooner rather than later?</string>
  <string id="6008168">I think my arm is going to fall off.</string>
  <string id="6008169">Much more of this, and all I'll be able to do is bullshit them!</string>
  <string id="6008173">This isn't going so well...</string>
  <string id="6008174">I'm not going to make it...</string>
  <string id="6008175">I... think I need a rescue here.</string>
  <string id="6008179">That was a beauty of a shot!</string>
  <string id="6008180">Better luck in the next life!</string>
  <string id="6008181">Bianca, you minx! That was beautiful!</string>
  <string id="6008185">Nothing I'm doing seems to work!</string>
  <string id="6008186">Bianca's not doing much here.</string>
  <string id="6008190">I'm good, but I'm not that good.</string>
  <string id="6008191">You don't want me to aim for something... I don't know, less impossible?</string>
  <string id="6008192">That's a bit far, don't you think?</string>
  <string id="6008196">Oh, look, they brought their friends!</string>
  <string id="6008197">We've got more on the way!</string>
  <string id="6008198">More of them! Great, I was starting to get lonely.</string>
  <string id="6008202">Why is it nobody ever seems happy to see us?</string>
  <string id="6008203">Bianca's locked and loaded!</string>
  <string id="6008204">Grab something sharp and pointy! We've got company!</string>
  <string id="6008208">Remind me to buy you a drink later.</string>
  <string id="6008209">Thanks! That was a little too close for my taste.</string>
  <string id="6008210">I owe you one.</string>
  <string id="6008211">I'm fine... Where's Bianca?</string>
  <string id="6008212">I knew I wasn't dead! There would've been more women around...</string>
  <string id="6008213">I'll try to repay you by not doing that again. Deal?</string>
  <string id="6008214">Thanks. I 'm not ready to go just yet.</string>
  <string id="6008218">Holy mother of green cheeses! How'd they take that woman down?</string>
  <string id="6008224">They got Whatshisname, the mage? Damnation!</string>
  <string id="6008225">Blast it! Daisy got herself knocked out!</string>
  <string id="6008227">The tame elf is down!</string>
  <string id="6008228">Don't die on me, Rivaini! You still owe me a pint!</string>
  <string id="6008229">We're losing people!</string>
  <string id="6008230">We need a healer out here, fast!</string>
  <string id="6008234">You blighted, ball-less, whelp; you want a piece of me?</string>
  <string id="6008235">Come here and give Bianca a kiss!</string>
  <string id="6008236">Dance with me, precious. I'll show you a thing or two.</string>
  <string id="6008240">Nothing to worry about.</string>
  <string id="6008241">Never fear, Varric is here.</string>
  <string id="6008242">I'm practically there.</string>
  <string id="6008246">Think I need to stop for a second.</string>
  <string id="6008247">Blast! I got hit worse than I thought.</string>
  <string id="6008248">I can't keep going like this.</string>
  <string id="6008252">Maker's breath, Hawke! You do get results, don't you?</string>
  <string id="6008253">Remind me never to get on our bad side. Seems to be... unhealthy.</string>
  <string id="6008254">There's a lesson to be learned here: Messing with us is suicidal.</string>
  <string id="6008255">Ugh, I think I got blood on my coat.</string>
  <string id="6008259">Let's not do that again. I'm not ready to meet my ancestors.</string>
  <string id="6008260">Thank the Maker! I'm too good-looking to die this young.</string>
  <string id="6008261">Bianca? You okay? Oh, I'm sorry baby.</string>
  <string id="6008262">Dear Varric, please learn to parry. Love, your innards. Ouch.</string>
  <string id="6008266">That's not really my thing.</string>
  <string id="6008267">You want me to do what? I don't think so.</string>
  <string id="6008268">Not likely.</string>
  <string id="6013249">The horde approaches. So we face them here.</string>
  <string id="6013252">Aaah, and here we are!</string>
  <string id="6013255">A witch!</string>
  <string id="6013258">It's all right, Fenris. She means us no harm.</string>
  <string id="6013261">Calm yourself. We know this one.</string>
  <string id="6013264">Friend of yours?</string>
  <string id="6013267">You speak the word as if it is cheap coin, meant for spending.</string>
  <string id="6013270">You don't know me.</string>
  <string id="6013273">Oh, I know your type.</string>
  <string id="6013276">Andaran atish'an, Asha'bellanar.</string>
  <string id="6013279">One of the people, I see, so young and bright. Do you know who I am, beyond that title?</string>
  <string id="6013282">I know only a little.</string>
  <string id="6013285">Then stand. The people bend their knee too quickly.</string>
  <string id="6013288">So refreshing to see someone who keeps their end of a bargain. I half-expected my amulet to end up in a merchant's pocket!</string>
  <string id="6013289">You were inside that amulet the entire time?</string>
  <string id="6013290">I carried you here?</string>
  <string id="6013291">I agreed to deliver the amulet, though you could have told me you were inside it.</string>
  <string id="6013292">We made a deal.</string>
  <string id="6013293">No one wanted to buy it. Maybe because it had a witch inside?</string>
  <string id="6013294">I couldn't sell it.</string>
  <string id="6013295">Just a piece. A small piece, but it was all I needed.</string>
  <string id="6013298">A bit of security, should the inevitable occur. And if I know my Morrigan, it already has.</string>
  <string id="6013299">Is that someone I should know?</string>
  <string id="6013300">Who is Morrigan?</string>
  <string id="6013301">She's a girl who thinks she knows what is what better than I, or anyone.</string>
  <string id="6013304">And why not? I raised her to be as she is! I cannot expect her to be less!</string>
  <string id="6013307">I'm not sure whether she's your daughter or your enemy.</string>
  <string id="6013310">Neither is she.</string>
  <string id="6013311">I don't understand. Are you some kind of vision?</string>
  <string id="6013312">Are you real?</string>
  <string id="6013313">Laughs</string>
  <string id="6013316">Must I be in only one place? Bodies are such limiting things.</string>
  <string id="6013319">I am but a fragment cast adrift from the whole. A bit of flotsam to cling to in the storm!</string>
  <string id="6013320">A fragment?</string>
  <string id="6013321">What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="6013322">You do not need to understand, child.</string>
  <string id="6013325">Know only that you may have saved my life, just as I once saved yours. An even trade, I think.</string>
  <string id="6013326">Why did you need me to bring you here?</string>
  <string id="6013327">Why not come yourself?</string>
  <string id="6013328">Because I had an appointment to keep!</string>
  <string id="6013331">And because I did not want to be followed. You smuggled me here quite nicely.</string>
  <string id="6013332">You should have told me what I would face.</string>
  <string id="6013333">I don't like being tricked.</string>
  <string id="6013334">Did I trick you? I asked you to bring the amulet, and you did.</string>
  <string id="6013337">If I thought it such an easy task, I might have asked anyone. But you have succeeded where others would not.</string>
  <string id="6013338">You have plans, I take it?</string>
  <string id="6013339">So what now?</string>
  <string id="6013340">Destiny awaits us both, dear girl. We have much to do.</string>
  <string id="6013343">Destiny awaits us both, dear boy. We have much to do.</string>
  <string id="6013346">But before I go, a word of advice?</string>
  <string id="6013349">We stand upon the precipice of change. The world fears the inevitable plummet into the abyss.</string>
  <string id="6013352">Watch for that moment... and when it comes, do not hesitate to leap.</string>
  <string id="6013355">It is only when you fall that you learn whether you can fly.</string>
  <string id="6013356">Stop speaking in riddles!</string>
  <string id="6013357">That was meaningless.</string>
  <string id="6013358">You're welcome.</string>
  <string id="6013361">What should I do?</string>
  <string id="6013362">What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="6013363">Do as I do. Become a dragon!</string>
  <string id="6013366">You could never be a dragon.</string>
  <string id="6013369">Cheap advice from a dragon.</string>
  <string id="6013370">Must be nice to have wings.</string>
  <string id="6013371">We all have our challenges.</string>
  <string id="6013374">Are we going to regret bringing her here?</string>
  <string id="6013377">We're going to regret bringing her here.</string>
  <string id="6013380">Regret is something I know well.</string>
  <string id="6013383">Take care not to cling to it, to hold it so close that it poisons your soul.</string>
  <string id="6013386">When the time comes for your regrets, remember me.</string>
  <string id="6013389">As for you, child, step carefully. No path is darker than when your eyes are shut.</string>
  <string id="6013392">Ma serannas, Asha'bellanar.</string>
  <string id="6013395">Now the time has come for me to leave. You have my thanks... and my sympathy.</string>
  <string id="6013399">What do you think, Fenris?</string>
  <string id="6013400">You are no simple witch.</string>
  <string id="6013403">Figured that out yourself, did you?</string>
  <string id="6013406">I have seen powerful mages, spirits, and abominations. But you are none of those things. What are you?</string>
  <string id="6013409">Such a curious lad. The chains are broken, but are you truly free?</string>
  <string id="6013412">You see a great deal.</string>
  <string id="6013415">I am a fly in the ointment. I am a whisper in the shadows. I am also an old, old woman. More than that you need not know.</string>
  <string id="6013417">What do you think, Anders?</string>
  <string id="6013418">What are you? A spirit? An abomination? This is no magic I've ever seen!</string>
  <string id="6013421">And you would know of spirits and abominations.</string>
  <string id="6013424">I'm a mage. Of course I know of such things.</string>
  <string id="6013427">Of course!</string>
  <string id="6013437">But we have nowhere else to go!</string>
  <string id="6013440">Go back to Ferelden. Kirkwall isn't going to take you.</string>
  <string id="6013443">We didn't come this far just to be turned back! Let us in!</string>
  <string id="6013446">But we can't afford passage back to Ferelden!</string>
  <string id="6013449">You should've thought of that before you came here.</string>
  <string id="6013465">Find Gamlen Amell or some other way into Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6013469">Speak to Captain Ewald in the Gallows Courtyard.</string>
  <string id="6013487">Cavril's Sundries</string>
  <string id="6013488">Hold on, Sunshine, I'm coming!</string>
  <string id="6013489">Hang on, Junior, help's on the way!</string>
  <string id="6013500">Athenril has agreed to provide a way into Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6013503">Meeran has agreed to provide a way into Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6013509">Jump to Gallows, Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6013510">Jump to Gallows</string>
  <string id="6013662">The village burned, and many innocents were slaughtered.</string>
  <string id="6013840">Who are you? Please, can you get me out of here? I just want to go home.</string>
  <string id="6013841">Tell me where he is.</string>
  <string id="6013842">Where is this Kelder?</string>
  <string id="6013843">He let me go and I tried to get out, but then those... things, they started coming out of the walls.</string>
  <string id="6013844">How did you escape your dastardly kidnapper? Kick to the groin? Sand in the eyes? Rock to the head?</string>
  <string id="6013845">You escaped?</string>
  <string id="6013849">I don't see any injuries, are you all right?</string>
  <string id="6013850">Are you hurt?</string>
  <string id="6013854">He hit me, told me I was nothing. I begged him to stop hurting me.</string>
  <string id="6013914">Darkspawn poured out of the Wilds, clashing against the army at the ruins of Ostagar.</string>
  <string id="6013917">King Cailan died on the field with his men, betrayed by his most trusted general.</string>
  <string id="6013978">Letters for the Player</string>
  <string id="6014002">She is a child, and does not understand. Her pity is admirable, but misplaced.</string>
  <string id="6014029">Don't you see? He didn't mean to hurt me! He told me! There are demons, they make him to do these horrible things!</string>
  <string id="6014088">Someone's left a surprise here for us.</string>
  <string id="6014089">Watch where you step!</string>
  <string id="6014090">Now, that's just rude. What are they trying to do, ruin my boots?</string>
  <string id="6014091">Everyone stay still and try not to make any loud noises...</string>
  <string id="6014094">Piece of cake.</string>
  <string id="6014095">We're good to go.</string>
  <string id="6014096">I love doing that.</string>
  <string id="6014097">Easy as pie.</string>
  <string id="6014100">Want me to take a look at that?</string>
  <string id="6014101">Don't suppose I could give that a shot?</string>
  <string id="6014102">You know, I might be able to give you a hand with that.</string>
  <string id="6014103">Mind if I try my hand at that?</string>
  <string id="6014110">Wait! That looks... sketchy.</string>
  <string id="6014111">Uh oh... this could be trouble.</string>
  <string id="6014112">I don't like the looks of this.</string>
  <string id="6014113">Be really careful where you step.</string>
  <string id="6014117">That wasn't so hard.</string>
  <string id="6014118">I could've done that blindfolded.</string>
  <string id="6014119">All done!</string>
  <string id="6014120">Was that what you had in mind?</string>
  <string id="6014124">Maybe I can help.</string>
  <string id="6014125">Leave that to me.</string>
  <string id="6014126">Mind if I give that a try?</string>
  <string id="6014127">This looks more like my specialty.</string>
  <string id="6014137">I thought I heard him calling for me. I almost went back to him. I didn't want to be eaten! But Kelder... he was...</string>
  <string id="6014248">You saved her! My little girl, I didn't dare hope... </string>
  <string id="6014251">Did you find that monster? Is he dead?</string>
  <string id="6014253">We could bring him back as the undead and then kill him again.</string>
  <string id="6014254">He can't get much deader.</string>
  <string id="6014256">I didn't believe an elf could ever get justice in Kirkwall. I speak for all of us when I say that we are in your debt, serah.</string>
  <string id="6014259">This is all I have, but nothing compared to what you've given me. Come, Lia, we best bring your mother this joyous news.</string>
  <string id="6014275"> I feel just as bad for those knife-ears as the next man, but ignoring the magistrate's direct orders? That's madness.</string>
  <string id="6014337">So you've found me. Going to finish Martin off properly this time, are you?</string>
  <string id="6014614">Hey! Who are you?</string>
  <string id="6014617">My, you're jumpy! Look at you, cowering in a corner. What happened to the fearless, dashing raider I used to know?</string>
  <string id="6014620">I'm not a raider anymore, Isabela. I'm just an honest merchant now.</string>
  <string id="6014673">I'll take care of it.</string>
  <string id="6014674">I'll help.</string>
  <string id="6014675">Find another hireling.</string>
  <string id="6014676">I'm not getting involved.</string>
  <string id="6014677">Fair enough. You know where to find me if you reconsider.</string>
  <string id="6014695">It's your cargo—you look for it.</string>
  <string id="6014696">Can't you do this yourself?</string>
  <string id="6014697">Are the raiders a big problem around here?</string>
  <string id="6014698">You mentioned raiders.</string>
  <string id="6014718">He won't harm Lia, or anyone else, ever again.</string>
  <string id="6014719">You don't need to worry.</string>
  <string id="6014720">No, that's all right. I'd rather he stay dead.</string>
  <string id="6014723">I did your dirty work. Now I want some coin for it.</string>
  <string id="6014724">Do I get a reward?</string>
  <string id="6014873">Got your payment right here. Just waiting on the good news.</string>
  <string id="6014874">Changed your mind about helping me?</string>
  <string id="6014878">There are always raiders on the seas, just like there are always bandits on the roads.</string>
  <string id="6014881">But they've been much more active of late. Like vultures, taking advantage of the Blight.</string>
  <string id="6014947">You'll need to look around the docks. The crates bear the seal of the Orlesian port authority, so you'll know it when you see it.</string>
  <string id="6014994">Please, Martin. You wouldn't know honest if I tied you up and spanked you with it.</string>
  <string id="6014998">You tie him up, I'll go find some honesty.</string>
  <string id="6014999">Sounds like a plan.</string>
  <string id="6015000">He may have stopped being a raider, but he's still a low-life sea rat. </string>
  <string id="6015001">You've got it wrong, Martin. Isabela sent me.</string>
  <string id="6015002">Isabela said you needed help.</string>
  <string id="6015011">You used to be a raider. What happened?</string>
  <string id="6015012">Why leave the raiders?</string>
  <string id="6015058">Those raiders are still looking for me. I'm not going to draw their attention.</string>
  <string id="6015059">They've got some big plan for Kirkwall, or so I've heard. If they're not a problem now, they will be soon.</string>
  <string id="6015060">I'll find your cargo, Martin. You have my word.</string>
  <string id="6015061">You can count on me.</string>
  <string id="6015062">You're assuming I know what an Orlesian port authority seal looks like.</string>
  <string id="6015063">Will I?</string>
  <string id="6015064">Just make sure you have my reward.</string>
  <string id="6015065">As long as I get paid.</string>
  <string id="6015069">Yes, I was a raider. Back then it was just smuggling and petty thievery.</string>
  <string id="6015084">The coin will be here.</string>
  <string id="6015087">Isabela's told me all about you, Martin.</string>
  <string id="6015088">Drop the act.</string>
  <string id="6015089">So he's not an honest merchant?</string>
  <string id="6015090">Not so honest, then?</string>
  <string id="6015116">Javaris</string>
  <string id="6015151">Sighs Isabela. I thought I told you to be discreet.</string>
  <string id="6015182">You're smuggling poison. I thought you were trying to change your ways.</string>
  <string id="6015184">Still not interested.</string>
  <string id="6015185">No.</string>
  <string id="6015233">Blackpowder Promise</string>
  <string id="6015248">Go to the Wounded Coast to kill the Tal-Vashoth bandits camped there.</string>
  <string id="6015282">So he made his name, settling his debts with the mercenaries.</string>
  <string id="6015285">So she made her name, settling her debts with the mercenaries.</string>
  <string id="6015291">So he remained, paying off his debt. Made a name for himself in the underworld.</string>
  <string id="6015294">So she remained, paying off her debt. Made a name for herself in the underworld.</string>
  <string id="6015463">No!</string>
  <string id="6015498">Hubert</string>
  <string id="6015510">The Tal-Vashoth are attacking travelers on the Wounded Coast.</string>
  <string id="6015511">Tell Javaris that the Tal-Vashoth are dead. Go to the Qunari Compound by the Docks at day.</string>
  <string id="6015512">The Arishok was impressed by the deaths of the Tal-Vashoth, but Javaris got nothing.</string>
  <string id="6015620">Bad luck—and judgment—brought us together here before the attack.</string>
  <string id="6015623">Apostate, keep your distance.</string>
  <string id="6015635">The 'spawn are clear in their intent, but a mage is always unknown. The Order dictates...</string>
  <string id="6015679">You going to buy me a drink to celebrate our victory?</string>
  <string id="6015682">I don't know if that's wise.</string>
  <string id="6015685">You drink the swill here?</string>
  <string id="6015686">Buy yourself a drink.</string>
  <string id="6015689">Well, if you're going to be that way...</string>
  <string id="6015692">Oh! Before I forget: You still looking for work? Because I have a friend who needs some help.</string>
  <string id="6015740">It sounds like your son is in trouble. Is there anything I can do?</string>
  <string id="6015741">Can I help?</string>
  <string id="6015761">Magic can be a fearful gift. Your son deserves the best aid learning how to manage it.</string>
  <string id="6015764">He ought to have his own life, out from the shackles of the Circle. Everyone should.</string>
  <string id="6015767">We'll find him before the templars. Don't trust them to have your son's best interests at heart.</string>
  <string id="6015770">The boy sounds one breath away from becoming an abomination. Let's get to him, fast.</string>
  <string id="6015773">My husband, Wesley, was a templar. They're not all fanatics to be feared.</string>
  <string id="6015776">Don't coddle this boy. If he is a mage, he's dangerous and belongs in the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6015779">Thank you. It has been a lonely time, hiding. It's almost a relief to finally confront this openly.</string>
  <string id="6015800">Wesley.</string>
  <string id="6015803">The Order dictates...</string>
  <string id="6015806">Dear, they saved us. The Maker understands.</string>
  <string id="6015809">Of course.</string>
  <string id="6015820">We will be fine. We all will.</string>
  <string id="6015823">It's an acquired taste.</string>
  <string id="6015828">Is this a friend, or a friend?</string>
  <string id="6015829">A friend?</string>
  <string id="6015830">I never let him steer my ship, if that's what you're asking. From what I hear, he doesn't have good control of his rudder.</string>
  <string id="6015833">His name's Martin. He has a room right here in the Hanged Man. Tell him I sent you.</string>
  <string id="6015836">And listen... he's in trouble with some raiders. Used to be one, and they didn't like that he tried to leave.</string>
  <string id="6015839">Whatever he's asking, it's probably going to be dangerous. Watch your back.</string>
  <string id="6015840">A friend of yours is a friend of mine. What can I do?</string>
  <string id="6015841">Always willing to help.</string>
  <string id="6015842">He didn't say, and I didn't ask, but I'm sure you're up to it.</string>
  <string id="6015845">Does it pay? I've no time for favors.</string>
  <string id="6015846">I'm not a charity.</string>
  <string id="6015847">He might pay, he might not—I didn't ask. If you're not interested, don't talk to him.</string>
  <string id="6015850">Just some friendly advice from Isabela to you, yes?</string>
  <string id="6015853">Now, you going to leave me to my drinking or what?</string>
  <string id="6015864">Wise girl.</string>
  <string id="6015865">Thank you, Wesley.</string>
  <string id="6015868">Then you will have mine. As always.</string>
  <string id="6015920">I'm looking for some cargo.</string>
  <string id="6015926">You're in luck! Cargo all around. Take your pick.</string>
  <string id="6015932">They don't pay you to be funny.</string>
  <string id="6015933">Shut up.</string>
  <string id="6015934">I could use your assistance.</string>
  <string id="6015935">Can you help me?</string>
  <string id="6015936">A laborer with a smart mouth! You hardly ever see those.</string>
  <string id="6015937">How unique!</string>
  <string id="6015938">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="6015941">I'm looking for crates sealed by the Orlesian port authority.</string>
  <string id="6015944">Haven't seen any. Sorry.</string>
  <string id="6015949">Talk to the harbor master.</string>
  <string id="6015952">I'll bet he's got information about your cargo. He's in his office.</string>
  <string id="6015955">Hey! If you're done wagging your tongue, can we get those sacks off the docks?</string>
  <string id="6015958">Right. Coming.</string>
  <string id="6015965">Shipping manifest?</string>
  <string id="6015971">I'm looking for cargo bearing the seal of the Orlesian port authority.</string>
  <string id="6015972">I have an inquiry.</string>
  <string id="6015973">Speak sense, man!</string>
  <string id="6015974">What?</string>
  <string id="6015981">Isabela</string>
  <string id="6015989">I wish you luck finding the lad.</string>
  <string id="6015993">Templars handle our own business.</string>
  <string id="6015997">I did not realize his name was known so widely.</string>
  <string id="6015998">Don't lie to me. I can see you're holding something back.</string>
  <string id="6015999">Tell me right now.</string>
  <string id="6016000">I just said as much. And I hardly think someone like you is best suited to such a delicate task.</string>
  <string id="6016008">Aveline, don't you think this matter concerns the whole city?</string>
  <string id="6016009">The city guard might help.</string>
  <string id="6016010">It does. And you templars are spread thin to begin with.</string>
  <string id="6016013">True. Sadly, there are more mages fleeing than we can easily keep up with.</string>
  <string id="6016024">Do you know anything about an Antivan merchant named Vincento?</string>
  <string id="6016025">Do you know Vincento?</string>
  <string id="6016026">Vincento? That's curious—we just received a missive from the hermandades in Antiva. A thief named Vincento fled their lands and is believed to be in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6016030">I will not forget the kindness you've shown me.</string>
  <string id="6016031">You have your money! What more do you want?</string>
  <string id="6016036">Well, at least you don't have to worry about the templars finding out anymore.</string>
  <string id="6016037">I'll keep your secret.</string>
  <string id="6016039">It'd be unfortunate if the templars learned that you lied about her. A few gold might prevent that.</string>
  <string id="6016040">Pay me, or I'll expose you.</string>
  <string id="6016046">Arishok</string>
  <string id="6016055">What? But he is human. They did not even wish me to raise him among them.</string>
  <string id="6016061">He may never forgive me for sending him there, but I'd rather him alive and furious than dead and buried.</string>
  <string id="6016064">As I said, I have little money, but this is a Dalish ring that has been in my family for generations. Please accept it with my thanks.</string>
  <string id="6016067">Every moment Feynriel is gone, I worry what has become of him.</string>
  <string id="6016138">Then let's not waste any more time.</string>
  <string id="6016139">Ugh. Aden, deal with this!</string>
  <string id="6016140">I think I lost it.</string>
  <string id="6016141">Not today.</string>
  <string id="6016142">Well, then you can't bring your goods in.</string>
  <string id="6016145">The shipping manifest—for your ship. Have to know what cargo's coming through Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6016148">Viscount's rules, not mine.</string>
  <string id="6016149">I need information, and you're going to give it to me.</string>
  <string id="6016150">Rules don't concern me.</string>
  <string id="6016157">Heh. Ol' Vincento said someone might come sniffing around.</string>
  <string id="6016158">I'm looking for a retired templar named Samson.</string>
  <string id="6016159">Are you Samson?</string>
  <string id="6016160">Huh. Retired. Sounds better than burned-out husk of a templar begging coins in the chokedamp.</string>
  <string id="6016161">Did you meet the boy?</string>
  <string id="6016162">Did Feynriel come to you?</string>
  <string id="6016163">Afraid so. Blighter was dead broke, though, not a silver on him. I help one mageling for free and I'll never get paid again.</string>
  <string id="6016164">You don't cooperate, and the templars will know you're helping rogue mages.</string>
  <string id="6016165">Tell me what you know.</string>
  <string id="6016166">Rogue... is that what you should be called, just for wanting to live like a person, not a beast?</string>
  <string id="6016171">I pointed him to a ship captain I know. Reiner. Sometimes he'll take on runaways. Took another apostate last week—girl I sent him.</string>
  <string id="6016174">Might have gone wrong, though. I heard rumors he took the both of them captive instead.</string>
  <string id="6016180">Reiner's not the patient type. I'd hurry if you want to reach that lad before the templars.</string>
  <string id="6016220">Get a hold of her!</string>
  <string id="6016232">No need to get tetchy. Talk to Aden. He'll answer your questions.</string>
  <string id="6016267">Captain Reiner's Accounts</string>
  <string id="6016268">Sold:&#13;
- 2 barrels of fish, Viscount's Keep&#13;
- 3 barrels of rum, Hanged Man&#13;
- 1 male human mage, Danzig (Undercity)&#13;
- 25 Rivaini furs, Helton's Clothiers</string>
  <string id="6016269">Olivia's Letter to Thrask</string>
  <string id="6016270">Father,&#13;
&#13;
I know the sacrifices you've made to conceal my secret, but I am a child no longer. I cannot burden you my whole life, lest my secret destroy us both. I must live my own life as a woman... and as a mage. It is oddly freeing to write the word. &#13;
&#13;
Farewell, Father. I hope one day you make peace between what you have been taught and what you have seen.&#13;
&#13;
All my love,&#13;
Olivia</string>
  <string id="6016288">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="6016294">Great! Just wonderful.</string>
  <string id="6016297">You're under arrest, Vincento. Come with us. </string>
  <string id="6016309">Son? I have never had that privilege, serah. My poor wife, she is back in Antiva, and cannot see me often with my travels.</string>
  <string id="6016310">You've got an elf-blood bastard running around and I know you know where to find him.</string>
  <string id="6016311">Don't lie to me.</string>
  <string id="6016312">H-Hold off, all right? Yesterday was the first I met the boy.</string>
  <string id="6016315">Perhaps you can set his mind at ease...</string>
  <string id="6016316">Bethany?</string>
  <string id="6016317">We're not templars, serah. Feynriel has nothing to fear from us.</string>
  <string id="6016318">I know you're scared for him.</string>
  <string id="6016319">Maldición! You're a mage! I suppose you'd be kind, then, to a boy who resists being taken in by templars?</string>
  <string id="6016322">The boy's in over his head, so I sent him to the only man I know who doesn't despise mages. A former templar named Samson.</string>
  <string id="6016323">You're a wanted man, Vincento.</string>
  <string id="6016324">I've got bad news.</string>
  <string id="6016325">Blighters! Who? Did they follow me from Antiva? Perhaps Rivain will be beyond their reach...</string>
  <string id="6016331">You abandoned your son at birth. If you regret this at all, help me save him now.</string>
  <string id="6016332">Make up for your neglect.</string>
  <string id="6016333">There's no man in Kirkwall who is friend to an elf-blood mageling. A smile won't buy my trust.</string>
  <string id="6016336">Perhaps he does need more help than I could give him.</string>
  <string id="6016365">The Bone Pit</string>
  <string id="6016424">Why, look here, boys. Volunteers! Clap 'em in irons, and let's see what the Tevinters will pay for them.</string>
  <string id="6016427">Andraste's great flaming ass! How did you do that?</string>
  <string id="6016428">Make him talk.</string>
  <string id="6016429">Fenris...</string>
  <string id="6016430">I can do that.</string>
  <string id="6016445">The boy you bought from Captain Reiner. Where is he?</string>
  <string id="6016446">Give me Feynriel!</string>
  <string id="6016448">Answer my questions, and I won't trouble you about this little operation.</string>
  <string id="6016449">I just want to talk.</string>
  <string id="6016450">You die now, there won't be any trouble at all.</string>
  <string id="6016463">Andraste's tits, human! You know how many people want to hire onto this expedition?</string>
  <string id="6016466">This is the sort of venture that can make a man for life! I'm not about to take any chances hiring random humans.</string>
  <string id="6016482">Take one more step, and the boy dies.</string>
  <string id="6016483">This is as close as I get.</string>
  <string id="6016484">I don't need to step.</string>
  <string id="6016485">Screams</string>
  <string id="6016486">You're assuming I want him alive more than I want you dead.</string>
  <string id="6016487">I'll risk that.</string>
  <string id="6016488">Damnation!</string>
  <string id="6016491">Put the sword down. I just want to talk.</string>
  <string id="6016492">Let's work something out.</string>
  <string id="6016493">You want the boy, match the offer I have from Tevinter. Undamaged mage-flesh, full market price.</string>
  <string id="6016500">Let him go unharmed, and you'll get your blood-money.</string>
  <string id="6016501">I have sovereigns.</string>
  <string id="6016502">Done. There are easier slaves to take.</string>
  <string id="6016503">Give me the boy and all your gold, and I'll let you live.</string>
  <string id="6016504">You should pay me.</string>
  <string id="6016505">You overreach, southerner.</string>
  <string id="6016506">Tell this dirtbag who we are.</string>
  <string id="6016507">Varric, help me out.</string>
  <string id="6016508">If I were you, I wouldn't be threatening the viscount's son.</string>
  <string id="6016511">I seek no war with the Free Marches. Take the lad to his father.</string>
  <string id="6016541">I can't thank you enough for letting me come here. But it hasn't been... quite what I thought.</string>
  <string id="6016553">This is all I feared.</string>
  <string id="6016556">They know nothing of how to stop my nightmares, save by destroying my mind.</string>
  <string id="6016565">You would have let him kill me!</string>
  <string id="6016568">He had a sword at my throat and you just... I mean, thank you, but... What if you were wrong?</string>
  <string id="6016569">I'm never wrong.</string>
  <string id="6016570">But I wasn't.</string>
  <string id="6016574">It will be your humanity that marks you among the people, not your magic. But I think they will take you.</string>
  <string id="6016577">If there is another place he can harness his gifts, I cannot blame him for wishing to go there.</string>
  <string id="6016580">Keeper trains him, keeps him safe from demons, no one gets locked up. Sounds like a winning plan.</string>
  <string id="6016583">If there was another way, the Circle would know it.</string>
  <string id="6016584">Because no Dalish mage ever went astray.</string>
  <string id="6016585">His own mother says he's plagued by demons. Do you really want him loose?</string>
  <string id="6016586">You deserve a chance at freedom.</string>
  <string id="6016587">Do what you think is best.</string>
  <string id="6016589">I'm sorry, Feynriel. You'll learn to control your abilities at the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6016590">Go to the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6016609">I apologize on Liam's behalf. He is a very, very busy man.</string>
  <string id="6016624">I'm Aden, the harbor master's assistant. I understand you're looking for Orlesian cargo.</string>
  <string id="6016633">I've seen the crates, but can't remember where. Such a shame.</string>
  <string id="6016634">Get to the point.</string>
  <string id="6016635">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="6016636">You're wasting my time!</string>
  <string id="6016637">No sense in talking to you.</string>
  <string id="6016638">Now, don't be pessimistic.</string>
  <string id="6016641">The clink of gold coin often jogs my memory.</string>
  <string id="6016642">Is this enough to help you remember?</string>
  <string id="6016643">This might help.</string>
  <string id="6016644">Ah! It's coming back to me. The cargo is in Alton Woodrow's warehouse, by the dock.</string>
  <string id="6016647">I'm glad we could help each other out.</string>
  <string id="6016650">I'm not paying for this.</string>
  <string id="6016651">This is ridiculous.</string>
  <string id="6016652">Then I am deeply sorry I could not be of more assistance. Good day.</string>
  <string id="6016655">They say your life flashes in front of your eyes before you die.</string>
  <string id="6016656">Fear will help you remember.</string>
  <string id="6016657">Any helpful flashes yet?</string>
  <string id="6016660">Ah! Er, I think the cargo is in Alton Woodrow's warehouse, not too far from here.</string>
  <string id="6016663">Maker's breath!</string>
  <string id="6016668">This expedition can open doors for us in this city. We have to go with you.</string>
  <string id="6016669">We want this job.</string>
  <string id="6016670">We've fought and killed darkspawn. How many of your hired men can say the same?</string>
  <string id="6016671">We have experience.</string>
  <string id="6016672">I'll buy you a drink before we head into the Deep Roads. Everyone wins!</string>
  <string id="6016673">Get to know us, Bartrand.</string>
  <string id="6016676">There's a memory in this head waiting to be unlocked.</string>
  <string id="6016678">This is private property.</string>
  <string id="6016679">What are you guarding?</string>
  <string id="6016680">What's in there?</string>
  <string id="6016684">There's someone coming. Tell the others.</string>
  <string id="6016687">Let's see what's behind that door.</string>
  <string id="6016688">Can I go in?</string>
  <string id="6016689">Who owns this warehouse?</string>
  <string id="6016690">Whose private property?</string>
  <string id="6016691">There's a fire on the other side of this row! Get help before it spreads!</string>
  <string id="6016692">Fire!</string>
  <string id="6016693">Imported goods.</string>
  <string id="6016694">Master Woodrow, I suppose. It's rented storage space.</string>
  <string id="6016695">No visitors allowed.</string>
  <string id="6016696">I must have taken a wrong turn.</string>
  <string id="6016697">I should go.</string>
  <string id="6016698">What?</string>
  <string id="6016701">Don't you hear the screaming? Are you deaf?</string>
  <string id="6016704">I don't hear anything...</string>
  <string id="6016707">Shit. A fire could destroy the loot. We have to check!</string>
  <string id="6016710">But...</string>
  <string id="6016713">Come on!</string>
  <string id="6016716">Be off with you then.</string>
  <string id="6016719">You're in my way.</string>
  <string id="6016720">Time to die.</string>
  <string id="6016721">We're under attack!</string>
  <string id="6016731">I said, this is private property.</string>
  <string id="6016738">Snores</string>
  <string id="6016739">Shut your mouth, you bitch...</string>
  <string id="6016740">The pie... it's in the pie.</string>
  <string id="6016741">Sneezes</string>
  <string id="6016742">Snorts</string>
  <string id="6016747">Get Back to Work</string>
  <string id="6016748">Convince the remaining miners to return to work. They can be found by day in Lowtown near the Hanged Man.</string>
  <string id="6016749">Tell Hubert that his miners are returning to work. He's in Hightown's market by day.</string>
  <string id="6016750">Tell Hubert that his miners are returning to work. He's in Hightown's market by day.</string>
  <string id="6016752">The Price of Doing Business</string>
  <string id="6016753">Hubert says that the Coterie will soon try to extort money from the Bone Pit. He asked you to speak with Lilley the Knife in Darktown, who offers an alternative to dealing with the Coterie.</string>
  <string id="6016755">Look, precious, I don't care if you tore the horns off an ogre with your bare hands.</string>
  <string id="6016756">Get in line, human. Half of Kirkwall wants to be my best friend right now.</string>
  <string id="6016757">Hubert says that the Coterie will soon try to extort money from the Bone Pit. He asked you to speak with Lilley the Knife in Darktown, who offers an alternative to dealing with the Coterie.</string>
  <string id="6016760">A man named Estas approached you as you were leaving Arlan's. He says he represents a more honorable group of men, who can protect the mine against Arlan and all other threats in exchange for a small stake in the profits of the mine. You agree to Estas' proposal.&#13;
&#13;
Return to Hubert with the news.</string>
  <string id="6016761">A man named Estas approached you as you were leaving Arlan's, offering alternative protection for the mine. You refused Estas's proposal.&#13;
&#13;
Return to Hubert with the news.</string>
  <string id="6016762">You returned to Hubert after meeting with Lilley.</string>
  <string id="6016765">You won't be able to protect your son from the templars alone.</string>
  <string id="6016766">You're in over your head.</string>
  <string id="6016770">Please, Ser Thrask! He won't go to the Circle willingly, but it's the only place...</string>
  <string id="6016773">Madam, we'll do our best to find your son, but I cannot guarantee his safety if he continues to resist templar jurisdiction.</string>
  <string id="6016776">He's just a boy!</string>
  <string id="6016779">He's an apostate.</string>
  <string id="6016789">You... you heard all of that and still you would help? An apostate? Oh, thank you...</string>
  <string id="6016795">I have done all I can to protect him.</string>
  <string id="6016798">I am Arianni. My boy, Feynriel... he's all I have, all my family. When I learned he had magic, I could not bear to send him to the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6016801">But his connection to the Fade... it gives him nightmares, dreams of demons, speaking in his mind. I would rather lose him to the Circle than to himself.</string>
  <string id="6016802">What kind of dreams is he having?</string>
  <string id="6016803">Tell me about the nightmares.</string>
  <string id="6016804">Did your son run away?</string>
  <string id="6016805">Where is Feynriel now?</string>
  <string id="6016806">I promise, you will see your son again.</string>
  <string id="6016807">I will bring Feynriel back.</string>
  <string id="6016808">What exactly do you need me to do?</string>
  <string id="6016809">Where do I start?</string>
  <string id="6016812">Abominations are always so awkward at family reunions.</string>
  <string id="6016813">That is a problem...</string>
  <string id="6016822">That is why I turned to the Circle. They are the only ones that can protect a mage from his own powers.</string>
  <string id="6016823">He learned I had contacted Ser Thrask. He felt I... betrayed his trust.</string>
  <string id="6016826">He thinks he can live free of the Circle, but I am afraid without proper training, he'll kill himself.</string>
  <string id="6016827">Tell me the whole story.</string>
  <string id="6016828">What exactly happened?</string>
  <string id="6016829">Those look like Dalish tattoos. Why do you live in the city?</string>
  <string id="6016830">Are you Dalish?</string>
  <string id="6016833">I learned years ago that my son likely had magical talent. But we could not bear the thought of him locked in the Gallows... so we hid.</string>
  <string id="6016836">When the nightmares began, Feynriel still refused to contact the Circle. </string>
  <string id="6016839"> But I... I truly think they are the only people who might save his life.</string>
  <string id="6016840">I was born to the Dalish, but came to Kirkwall for a time and... dallied with a human merchant. Vincento.</string>
  <string id="6016843">When I found I was with child, neither Vincento nor my tribe wished the burden of an elf-blooded human infant.</string>
  <string id="6016846">I raised Feynriel myself, here in the alienage.</string>
  <string id="6016853">You're looking for a quick way out of the slums, right? You and every other Fereldan in this dump.</string>
  <string id="6016857">Find another meal ticket.</string>
  <string id="6016883">Then you have given me the greatest blessing of Maker or man.</string>
  <string id="6016886">Just find him, please. Bring him somewhere safe.</string>
  <string id="6016889">No! Please, you must find him before... before the demons finish their work. He must be brought to safety.</string>
  <string id="6016895">I don't know where Feynriel has gone, but there are two places you might start your search.</string>
  <string id="6016898">Ser Thrask has been looking for him. If you speak to him in the Gallows, he'll be able to tell you what ground he's already covered.</string>
  <string id="6016901">And Feynriel's father, Vincento, recently returned from Antiva. He's a merchant in the Lowtown Bazaar. Feynriel might have sought him out. </string>
  <string id="6016902">Tell me about this templar.</string>
  <string id="6016903">What is Thrask like?</string>
  <string id="6016904">I believe he's a good man. He doesn't hate mages, but sees what it took me too long to realize—even the best-intentioned mages are at the mercy of their sleeping minds.</string>
  <string id="6016907">There are other templars who are much less sympathetic.</string>
  <string id="6016908">You and Feynriel's father are not married?</string>
  <string id="6016909">Tell me about Vincento.</string>
  <string id="6016910">Vincento had no desire for a wife or an elf-blooded child. I haven't seen him since the day I told him.</string>
  <string id="6016913">I have written, though, to keep him informed about his child. Feynriel wanted to meet him.</string>
  <string id="6016914">I will not leave you fearful for a moment longer than necessary.</string>
  <string id="6016915">I'll go right now.</string>
  <string id="6016916">I'll ask around, but no guarantees.</string>
  <string id="6016917">Don't hold your breath.</string>
  <string id="6016921">Perhaps you know Arianni from when she was with the Dalish?</string>
  <string id="6016924">We don't all know each other. There are a lot of clans, you know.</string>
  <string id="6016927">Perhaps your friend knew him in the alienage?</string>
  <string id="6016930">Not every elf lives in one of your cages, templar.</string>
  <string id="6016933">Are you a friend of his?</string>
  <string id="6016935">Have you met him? What is he like?</string>
  <string id="6016936">Tell me about Feynriel.</string>
  <string id="6016940">From his mother's description, he sounds much like any youngster we bring to the Circle—frightened of his gift, resentful at losing his freedom, convinced he is the one exception to our laws.</string>
  <string id="6016943">Hardly someone you would wish the power to murder people with his mind.</string>
  <string id="6016946">I have passed their request for aid to Captain Jeven of the city guard.</string>
  <string id="6016947">No young boy should have to face down demons alone.</string>
  <string id="6016948">I want to help Feynriel.</string>
  <string id="6016949">An untrained mage cannot be set loose on innocent people.</string>
  <string id="6016950">Feynriel is a menace.</string>
  <string id="6016952">It is surprising what sympathies mages evoke. I always expect people to be more wary of their powers than touched by their struggles.</string>
  <string id="6016955">They always think of us as the enemy, but it is the mages themselves who are protected most by the Circle and its rituals.</string>
  <string id="6016958">Sighs If we do not find Feynriel soon, it will not matter. Either he will be taken by the demons or by less mystical predators.</string>
  <string id="6016961">And I have said more than enough on the topic. This is a templar matter and we will be handling it.</string>

  <string id="6017037">There is a templar—former templar—by the name of Samson. He left the Order due to... philosophical differences. He has been known to help mages flee Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6017043">If Feynriel went to him, Samson wouldn't tell me. He stays out of sight by day, but I have seen him at night, near the entrance to Darktown.</string>
  <string id="6017050">Thrask's Journal</string>
  <string id="6017051">In Search of Feynriel&#13;
&#13;
Day 1: Visited the Dalish. Hoped to find boy with mother's kin. No luck.&#13;
&#13;
Day 3: Checked healers' homes and the guardsmen's prisons. Nothing.&#13;
&#13;
Day 4: Spoke to Samson. He seemed to be hiding something. I think he may know more of the boy than he admitted. I am stationing two templars at the entrance to the Undercity to watch him to see if the boy shows up.&#13;
&#13;
Day 5: Beginning interviews with alienage elves.</string>
  <string id="6017089">Speak to the Arishok in the Qunari Compound by the Docks.</string>
  <string id="6017090">Go to the Coterie in Darktown to find where Javaris has gone.</string>
  <string id="6017091">Javaris has fled the city. Follow him using the tunnels that lead from Darktown to Smuggler's Cut.</string>

  <string id="6017409">Even if I did, I don't know where he is now. I told you that.</string>
  <string id="6017412">Don't lie to me! You knew her even before she became the Champion!</string>
  <string id="6017415">Even if I did, I don't know where she is now. I told you that.</string>
  <string id="6017418">Do you have any idea what's at stake here?</string>
  <string id="6017421">Let me guess: your precious Chantry's fallen to pieces and put the entire world on the brink of war?</string>
  <string id="6017424">And you need the one person who could help you put it back together.</string>
  <string id="6017427">The Champion was at the heart of it when it all began.</string>
  <string id="6017430">If you can't point me to him, tell me everything you know.</string>
  <string id="6017433">If you can't point me to her, tell me everything you know.</string>
  <string id="6017436">You aren't worried I'll just make it up as I go?</string>

  <string id="6017452">Keran</string>
  <string id="6017456">Tarohne</string>
  <string id="6017476">I found your son.</string>
  <string id="6017487">My... son? I don't know what you're talking about.</string>
  <string id="6017488">If you stop pretending nothing's wrong, maybe you can help him.</string>
  <string id="6017489">Kelder is very sick.</string>
  <string id="6017490">You bloody well know your son is a killer.</string>
  <string id="6017491">Don't lie to me.</string>
  <string id="6017492">You have no right to throw around such accusations!</string>
  <string id="6017495">I am not going to lose my son because a handful of elves make up ridiculous stories! You'll not mention this again.</string>
  <string id="6017496">You paid for my services, not my silence. And I'd say that to you, silence is worth just as much.</string>
  <string id="6017497">Convince me not to.</string>
  <string id="6017498">Are you blackmailing me? You disgusting, pathetic— Fine. Take it. I do not want to see or hear from you again.</string>
  <string id="6017501">I won't talk, but he is known. How long before they connect him to you?</string>
  <string id="6017502">That secret won’t last.</string>
  <string id="6017503">Take your damned reward, I'm done here.</string>
  <string id="6017506">You dare show your face to me again? If you know what's good for you, you'll leave my city and never come back.</string>
  <string id="6017610">Praise Andraste you came along. Them dragons would have sniffed me out for certain. </string>
  <string id="6017613">Javaris</string>
  <string id="6017658">Greetings, my lady. You look like a woman who'd appreciate the finest rubies from Antiva gracing her lovely neck.</string>
  <string id="6017661">I bring only the best northern merchandise to the Free Marches.</string>
  <string id="6017662">Actually, I'm more interested in your son.</string>
  <string id="6017663">I'm looking for Feynriel.</string>
  <string id="6017664">My lady! I am a bachelor. I have never met a woman of sufficient beauty and charm to tie Vincento down... Laughs</string>
  <string id="6017667">Please, serah. I know you must fear for Feynriel, but we mean him no harm.</string>
  <string id="6017670">Hrmph. Hard to tell in this city who means who harm, no?</string>
  <string id="6017671">We are no templars, serah. You'll find no better friend to a young, scared mage.</string>
  <string id="6017674">Let us not ruin the day with such weighty thoughts. Perhaps I could show you my silks...</string>
  <string id="6017675">I'll take a look.</string>
  <string id="6017676">Sounds like a deal.</string>
  <string id="6017677">Lucky you came early, my friend.</string>
  <string id="6017761">I'll tell you what I can, but be a friend and keep your voice down. There's another dragon close by.</string>
  <string id="6017762">You should get out of here.</string>
  <string id="6017763">You can go now.</string>
  <string id="6017764">Don't have to tell me twice. You should leave, too, but don't go that way. There's this huge dragon!</string>
  <string id="6017805">Seemed like a good lad. The kind of son I might have been proud of.</string>
  <string id="6017808">Of course.</string>
  <string id="6017809">You have no idea.</string>
  <string id="6017810">To an elf-blooded child, abandoned by his human father? Of course we would.</string>
  <string id="6017811">Fine, hold your tongue. It's on your head if Feynriel dies!</string>
  <string id="6017812">Your silence will kill him.</string>
  <string id="6017814">Another Fereldan street rat? Are you here to waste my time, or do you actually have coin to spend?</string>
  <string id="6017815">Greet customers that way, and you'll earn more beatings than coins.</string>
  <string id="6017816">Mind your manners.</string>
  <string id="6017817">Actually, my coin and I were just leaving.</string>
  <string id="6017818">Wasting your time.</string>
  <string id="6017819">Are you an armorer? A weaponsmith?</string>
  <string id="6017820">What goods do you sell?</string>
  <string id="6017827">I think you've got enough coin together to get in on the expedition. We ought to go see my brother.</string>
  <string id="6017838">Eh, I am having a bad week. There are few Fereldans of means in Kirkwall. Forgive me?</string>
  <string id="6017844">Perhaps another time.</string>
  <string id="6017845">Farewell.</string>
  <string id="6017848">I trust you are well satisfied with your last purchase? I don't offer refunds.</string>
  <string id="6017849">Do you intend to make a purchase this time?</string>
  <string id="6017858">Where to?</string>
  <string id="6017859">Natural Caverns</string>
  <string id="6017860">Natural Caverns</string>
  <string id="6017864">I had to suspend operations! My workers are lost in the mines or have run off. Serves me right for hiring Fereldan refugees.</string>
  <string id="6017865">Surely the miners had good reason to leave.</string>
  <string id="6017866">What happened to the workers?</string>
  <string id="6017870">The Bone Pit is just outside the city. Any map will show it.</string>
  <string id="6017872">What's the reward?</string>
  <string id="6017873">What are you paying?</string>
  <string id="6017898">I suppose if you have aided me, you mean no harm to the lad. I sent him to Samson, the only man I know who helps mages.</string>
  <string id="6017899">The boy is a mage of elven blood. Do you wonder I fear for him?</string>
  <string id="6017904">His conscience plagues him, having served the templars too long. He now helps mages on the run.</string>
  <string id="6018133">What do you know? I was told my old friend Thrask was advising you folks to seek me out.</string>
  <string id="6018419">Anything in particular I should know about your brother?</string>
  <string id="6018420">Tell me about Bartrand.</string>
  <string id="6018421">If we'll be working together, I should find out more about you.</string>
  <string id="6018422">I want to get to know you.</string>
  <string id="6018423">What are your plans for this trip into the Deep Roads?</string>
  <string id="6018424">Let's discuss the expedition.</string>
  <string id="6018444">Are you going to the Bone Pit soon?</string>
  <string id="6018456">Stand back!</string>
  <string id="6018457">Maker forgive you!</string>
  <string id="6018458">Run while you can!</string>
  <string id="6018459">I'm not hiding anymore!</string>
  <string id="6018460">Little Bethany, all grown up!</string>
  <string id="6018461">Ferelden lives!</string>
  <string id="6018462">Maker defend me!</string>
  <string id="6018463">I'll handle this one.</string>
  <string id="6018464">What are you, afraid?</string>
  <string id="6018465">Your mistake...</string>
  <string id="6018466">Take two steps back...</string>
  <string id="6018467">Fire and ice obey me!</string>
  <string id="6018468">Why don't you try some of this, buddy!</string>
  <string id="6018469">See what I can do now!</string>
  <string id="6018470">Come here, you bastard!</string>
  <string id="6018471">Line them up for me! I'll take them down!</string>
  <string id="6018472">Let's do this!</string>
  <string id="6018473">Bianca, baby, introduce yourself!</string>
  <string id="6018474">Bianca's getting lonely!</string>
  <string id="6018475">Not the brightest thing you could have done!</string>
  <string id="6018476">I could do this in my sleep!</string>
  <string id="6018477">When's the fighting start? Bianca's starting to get bored!</string>
  <string id="6018478">Please, Bianca could handle this herself!</string>
  <string id="6018479">Piece of cake!</string>
  <string id="6018480">Is that all you've got?</string>
  <string id="6018481">Somebody order a shot in the face?</string>
  <string id="6018482">Another one for me! How many have you gotten, Hawke?</string>
  <string id="6018483">One more for the dwarf!</string>
  <string id="6018484">Last one to strike buys the drinks!</string>
  <string id="6018485">Looks like trouble's coming!</string>
  <string id="6018486">We're in trouble, here!</string>
  <string id="6018487">I think we better fall back!</string>
  <string id="6018488">Watch out!</string>
  <string id="6018489">I'm not going to make it far like this.</string>
  <string id="6018490">Damnation! I've got to stop!</string>
  <string id="6018491">Nice work!</string>
  <string id="6018492">That could have gone better.</string>
  <string id="6018494">Oooh! That was surprisingly fun.</string>
  <string id="6018495">Ugh. Dead guy.</string>
  <string id="6018496">You're not getting away with that!</string>
  <string id="6018497">Let's see what you're made of...</string>
  <string id="6018498">Still bleeding, here...</string>
  <string id="6018499">I-I've got to lie down.</string>
  <string id="6018500">That's a lot of dead people...</string>
  <string id="6018501">Groans</string>
  <string id="6018508">I have need of stout assistance. There is handsome money for those of skill.</string>
  <string id="6018509">Will no one show their good will? I can pay good coin to the kind-hearted.</string>
  <string id="6018510">Coin for skill on offer. I need someone of... flexible talents and secrecy.</string>
  <string id="6018514">Here, miss. Word is, you're looking for help and paying well.</string>
  <string id="6018517">I need someone native to the dark places beneath Lowtown. If you claim as much, yes, I will pay.</string>
  <string id="6018520">I am, I am. Let's just step into this alley and me and my fellows can have a look at the money on offer.</string>
  <string id="6018526">Is that sister daft? She'll be done over and thrown out.</string>
  <string id="6018527">Can she expect to survive Lowtown inviting that kind of attention?</string>
  <string id="6018528">That woman is in real trouble. We could help her.</string>
  <string id="6018529">That woman is mad. She'll be robbed if she's lucky!</string>
  <string id="6018530">She has chosen poorly.</string>
  <string id="6018531">Can you get this deep into Lowtown and be that stupid?</string>
  <string id="6018532">Is she that foolish? I mean, of course she is, but really?</string>
  <string id="6018533">Another sad Lowtown tale in the making. As if we needed another.</string>
  <string id="6018534">It's action if we want it. Always money in saving fools.</string>
  <string id="6018535">It's another fight, at least.</string>
  <string id="6018536">It does appear she could use some help. Especially now.</string>
  <string id="6018537">Worth looking into.</string>
  <string id="6018538">Can you save someone so intent on being foolish?</string>
  <string id="6018539">Daft lady, indeed.</string>
  <string id="6018543">An easy mark, and one she's probably earned.</string>
  <string id="6018544">Always prey for someone in Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6018545">A woman can truly be that daft in Lowtown?</string>
  <string id="6018555">Well, thank you for your timely intervention. I am... out of my element.</string>
  <string id="6018558">You're lucky you're not dead.</string>
  <string id="6018561">A foolish risk in Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6018564">Surely you didn't realize that just now.</string>
  <string id="6018567">I had to come here to get the type of person I need. Someone of bloody skill, but also integrity.</string>
  <string id="6018570">Perhaps the kind who might leap to someone's defense.</string>
  <string id="6018573">I have a charge who needs passage from the city. If you are willing and capable, meet me at my safehouse nearby.</string>
  <string id="6018574">I'm no caravan, woman.</string>
  <string id="6018575">This sounds beneath me.</string>
  <string id="6018576">You make a lot of assumptions. It almost got you killed already.</string>
  <string id="6018577">Who do you think you are?</string>
  <string id="6018578">I just saved you in an alley, and suddenly we're in business?</string>
  <string id="6018579">Have we met?</string>
  <string id="6018584">You're looking for the boy, right? Feyn-something?</string>
  <string id="6018587">I'll tell you now, there's not much I can do for you.</string>
  <string id="6018590">They don't do anything to keep you, you know? You join the Order, you're free to walk away. But they're the only ones who got the dust...</string>
  <string id="6018594">Is it true you give aid to apostates fleeing the templars?</string>
  <string id="6018595">So you help mages?</string>
  <string id="6018596">Just looking at you, I'd say you're a man who helps anyone for the right price.</string>
  <string id="6018597">You sure you can't help?</string>
  <string id="6018598">Wish I could do more, but I need coin to live, and your lad Feynriel didn't have any.</string>
  <string id="6018599">I would not presume, but you must need coin. You are in Lowtown, after all.</string>
  <string id="6018603">All the more reason to end this quickly. You must need coin. Everyone here does.</string>
  <string id="6018609">You're in Lowtown. What grand scheme could I be interrupting?</string>
  <string id="6018612">I thank you for coming. This matter is delicate, and I need someone of... limited notoriety who will not link this to me.</string>
  <string id="6018615">Drop it, or lose the hand.</string>
  <string id="6018618">I am expected.</string>
  <string id="6018621">Nice to see you, too.</string>
  <string id="6018624">It is an escort, but I think you will agree, the nature of the party makes this... unique.</string>
  <string id="6018627">My name is Sister Petrice. I have assumed a burden of charity. This is my charge.</string>
  <string id="6018631">The dust?</string>
  <string id="6018632">What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="6018633">Lyrium, an ore the dwarves mine. Magic in its raw form.</string>
  <string id="6018637">Andraste's breath...</string>
  <string id="6018640">Oh boy.</string>
  <string id="6018643">Twist my tale.</string>
  <string id="6018646">Maker...</string>
  <string id="6018649">Maker...</string>
  <string id="6018652">Shit... I mean, Maker.</string>
  <string id="6018655">A saarebas? Here?</string>
  <string id="6018658">She'va dhal...</string>
  <string id="6018664">Sister, you're daft.</string>
  <string id="6018667">Problematic...</string>
  <string id="6018670">Well, all right, then...</string>
  <string id="6018673">Would even a templar bind a mage like this?</string>
  <string id="6018677">I'd prefer to avoid making enemies among the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6018678">This will be trouble.</string>
  <string id="6018679">I can get him out of Kirkwall. He's a bit conspicuous for the streets, though.</string>
  <string id="6018680">I'll get him out.</string>
  <string id="6018681">You don't just stumble on something... someone like this.</string>
  <string id="6018682">How did you get him?</string>
  <string id="6018693">You need to drink the stuff to face down the magickers.</string>
  <string id="6018696">Problem is, if you ever try to stop, it just about kills you.</string>
  <string id="6018697">The mages I help, they're no more than children, newly discovered their magic and terrified.</string>
  <string id="6018700">Barely left their mothers' skirts, and now we're saying they got to be locked away for their own good. That demons are hunting them.</string>
  <string id="6018703">Do you wonder they run?</string>
  <string id="6018704">Right. The lad came to me, not a silver in his pockets. Told him there's nothing I can do for him.</string>
  <string id="6018709">Please tell me it's not too late to save him.</string>
  <string id="6018710">Where is he now?</string>
  <string id="6018711">So your good friend's a kidnapper. Can't say I'm surprised.</string>
  <string id="6018712">That figures.</string>
  <string id="6018713">Not a friend! Just someone who's not afraid to try this business.</string>
  <string id="6018716">If Feynriel's not in one piece when I find him, I'm coming after you next.</string>
  <string id="6018717">If he's dead, so are you.</string>
  <string id="6018718">Rein it in, friend. Was just trying to do the lad a good turn.</string>
  <string id="6018721">Rumor has it Reiner had the pair of them locked in a quays warehouse. Somewhere close to dockside.</string>
  <string id="6018724">You want to go looking, you might find the lad before he gets ransomed to the templars. Or worse.</string>
  <string id="6018725">That is obviously not an option. You must avoid incident with the guards—I cannot be linked to this.</string>
  <string id="6018728">This mage will be a fine example of how cruel Qunari are, even to their own. But only if this plays out just so.</string>
  <string id="6018731">The passage here leads to the warrens of the Undercity. It is dangerous, but that is why you were hired. Good luck.</string>
  <string id="6018732">We are each called to act in our own way. Complacency in the order has all but forced this.</string>
  <string id="6018739">For all their blasphemous certainty, the Qunari do have deserters. Those who seek freedom are hunted mercilessly.</string>
  <string id="6018740">If you are so intent on this, why not use Chantry resources?</string>
  <string id="6018741">Why protect him in secret?</string>
  <string id="6018743">Will he help? If I trust him at all...</string>
  <string id="6018744">Is he safe? Can he fight?</string>
  <string id="6018745">I don't know his capabilities, or if he can function at all in that collar. But I think he knows we are his only way out.</string>
  <string id="6018746">You're not interested in who you might be hiring?</string>
  <string id="6018747">You never asked my name.</string>
  <string id="6018748">And yet it is more than he has. My reach is limited. His struggle is his own. </string>
  <string id="6018755">I thank you for taking Ketojan. The passage leads through the Undercity and around the guard.</string>
  <string id="6018784">Please! Help me! Anyone...</string>
  <string id="6018787">Get the hands! I heard they can't do no spells without hands!</string>
  <string id="6018792">You know nothing of magic!</string>
  <string id="6018796">Never mind. I-I've stashed the boy in a cave. A smuggler hideout on the Wounded Coast.</string>
  <string id="6018799">Tevinters will be by to finish the deal today.</string>
  <string id="6018802">Now... c-can I go?</string>
  <string id="6018803">I let you live, and I condemn countless innocents to slavery.</string>
  <string id="6018804">No.</string>
  <string id="6018805">Sure! Oh, wait... I meant no.</string>
  <string id="6018806">No.</string>
  <string id="6018807">I'm done with you.</string>
  <string id="6018808">No.</string>
  <string id="6018809">Screams</string>
  <string id="6018810">I don't kill in cold blood. Not even a slimy toad.</string>
  <string id="6018811">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6018812">Scoffs</string>
  <string id="6018815">Of course. If I kill you, I can't sic the slavers on you later.</string>
  <string id="6018816">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6018817">Right... I'll, uh, get out of your way.</string>
  <string id="6018820">Get out of my sight.</string>
  <string id="6018821">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6018822">Thank you! Thank you. You can have first pick of my slave— Maybe I'd better just leave..</string>
  <string id="6018826">I'd make a terrible slave. I talk too much. </string>
  <string id="6018827">Pay for me?</string>
  <string id="6018836">Chokes</string>
  <string id="6018841">Nobody threatens me on my ground.</string>
  <string id="6018844">Feisty don't get you a better price.</string>
  <string id="6018847">Shut this bitch up!</string>
  <string id="6018848">Shut this buck up!</string>
  <string id="6018863">Mercenary</string>
  <string id="6018875">Hubert's Fine Goods</string>
  <string id="6018876">What?</string>
  <string id="6018879">Oh, I suppose you just got a tip from a slaver that he was selling mage-flesh cheap. You never thought to ask where he got it?</string>
  <string id="6018882">You never wondered if you were buying the viscount's well-known love child from his elven mistress, the boy he swore to protect even if it meant razing the entire Free Marches?</string>
  <string id="6018891">This was the price set on the boy. Please accept it... as an offer of peace.</string>
  <string id="6018892">Feynriel, go limp. I will not let him kill you.</string>
  <string id="6018893">I'll risk that.</string>
  <string id="6018894">You're mad! He's going slit my throat!</string>
  <string id="6018897">I'll take that chance.</string>
  <string id="6018898">I'll risk that.</string>
  <string id="6018901">You're no good to me as a corpse. Get down!</string>
  <string id="6018902">What about a small step? A hop? A caper?</string>
  <string id="6018903">Let's work something out.</string>
  <string id="6018904">Do not mock me, southerner.</string>
  <string id="6018907">Let him go now, and you don't.</string>
  <string id="6018908">Let's work something out.</string>
  <string id="6018911">Get back, boy, and witness your hero's fate.</string>
  <string id="6018938">Bartrand</string>
  <string id="6018940">Bartrand</string>
  <string id="6019013">Ketojan, is it? You need to be led out of the city?</string>
  <string id="6019016">Growls</string>
  <string id="6019022">Be ready, Ketojan.</string>
  <string id="6019031">Hold your spells, Ketojan, or I swear, I will gut you!</string>
  <string id="6019040">Can you stand?</string>
  <string id="6019043">Grunts</string>
  <string id="6019084">It has been difficult to get information, but look at him. Would you want this? We must have that in common.</string>
  <string id="6019087">Growls</string>
  <string id="6019092">Don't like this much, do you? I'd rather live here than in chains.</string>
  <string id="6019093">And now we're taking a stroll alongside a magical horned thing, through the worst part of Kirkwall. Great.</string>
  <string id="6019094">Tromping the deep dark with a horn-skull mage. And other colloquials to that effect.</string>
  <string id="6019095">I would not approve of coming here to avoid the guards, but these circumstances are... unique.</string>
  <string id="6019096">I don't like this. I wouldn't like it even without the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6019097">Right, let's get this shepherding over with.</string>
  <string id="6019098">If we must bring this mage to safety, let us do it quickly.</string>
  <string id="6019099">Dark, dank, and the company is troubling. Lovely.</string>
  <string id="6019103">Keep up. I'm your escort, not a shepherd.</string>
  <string id="6019104">Keep close, understand?</string>
  <string id="6019105">Let's go for a walk in the dark, chatty.</string>
  <string id="6019109">I don't understand the indifference of this creature. We fight and he does nothing.</string>
  <string id="6019110">I thought mages were supposed to be useful.</string>
  <string id="6019111">No talk and no fight. This Qunari is not much of a traveling partner.</string>
  <string id="6019112">We are making considerable effort, and yet this mage seems indifferent.</string>
  <string id="6019113">Why does this creature not help in his own escape?</string>
  <string id="6019114">What does it take to get this mage to pitch in and help?</string>
  <string id="6019115">The mage seems indifferent to our struggles, even with his freedom as the prize.</string>
  <string id="6019116">He's not very helpful, is he?</string>
  <string id="6019120">Why is everyone so scared of you? You're doing squat.</string>
  <string id="6019121">It would be easier if you assisted your own escape.</string>
  <string id="6019122">Don't hurt yourself by helping out, or anything.</string>
  <string id="6019126">What the blazes is this? Looks like a walking armory.</string>
  <string id="6019130">Look at this. Undercity's feared by all, but there's no shortage of fools with coin who want to test it.</string>
  <string id="6019149">What is this thing, collared like a dog lord's bitch?</string>
  <string id="6019152">You some sort of Qunari lover? Maybe I should get rid of you and see who'll pay the most for your pet.</string>
  <string id="6019155">Uh, I don't think it likes you threatening its master. Maybe we let this one pass.</string>
  <string id="6019156">Try me further, and my charge is the least of your worries.</string>
  <string id="6019157">Almost too late for that.</string>
  <string id="6019158">I'll show you different, pet or no pet.</string>
  <string id="6019164">By the Void! Kill it! Kill them all!</string>
  <string id="6019168">You will hold, basra vashedan. I am Arvaarad, and I claim possession of Saarebas at your heel.</string>
  <string id="6019174">I do not know how you come to hold his leash, but you have no claim in the Qun. He will be returned and this crime cleansed.</string>
  <string id="6019187">You show an unusual ability to reason, basra.</string>
  <string id="6019190">Saarebas! Nehraa aqun ebra kata Arvaarad!</string>
  <string id="6019205">Maker! You were to take him back to the Qun!</string>
  <string id="6019206">I know, cultural differences and all that, but that's just uncalled for!</string>
  <string id="6019207">Knew it! Can't trust a zealot!</string>
  <string id="6019208">Maker's breath! Why?</string>
  <string id="6019209">You murderer! Why?</string>
  <string id="6019210">I knew it. Damned horn-heads!</string>
  <string id="6019211">You had your captive! Why kill him?</string>
  <string id="6019212">What was the reason for that!</string>
  <string id="6019219">I'm not giving him to you. He'll choose his own path.</string>
  <string id="6019220">He must be free.</string>
  <string id="6019249">He lost his lead—the risk of corruption was certain. But he has owned his death by honoring you. He knows the Qun once more.</string>
  <string id="6019252">As will you.</string>
  <string id="6019253">What the blazes is wrong with you? Why attack me now?</string>
  <string id="6019254">You want to kill me too?</string>
  <string id="6019255">An uncollared Saarebas spoke to you. You were already exposed, but there's no way to know what demon may have ridden his words.</string>
  <string id="6019364">Bone Pit</string>
  <string id="6019365">Bone Pit</string>
  <string id="6019374">Take this! Take it!</string>
  <string id="6019375">Back!</string>
  <string id="6019376">Make it good!</string>
  <string id="6019377">I suffer no threat!</string>
  <string id="6019378">You are not enough!</string>
  <string id="6019379">Order will rule!</string>
  <string id="6019380">You!</string>
  <string id="6019381">Maker take you!</string>
  <string id="6019382">You will fall!</string>
  <string id="6019383">I deny you!</string>
  <string id="6019384">Stand down!</string>
  <string id="6019385">Unworthy!</string>
  <string id="6019386">Ha!</string>
  <string id="6019387">Growls</string>
  <string id="6019388">Now!</string>
  <string id="6019392">This one, here!</string>
  <string id="6019393">On my target! Now!</string>
  <string id="6019394">Focus here!</string>
  <string id="6019398">Fall back to me!</string>
  <string id="6019399">Rally here, around me!</string>
  <string id="6019400">Regroup here, with me!</string>
  <string id="6019404">Okay, time for something else.</string>
  <string id="6019405">Right, let's change this up.</string>
  <string id="6019406">This one needs something else. All right.</string>
  <string id="6019410">This better work.</string>
  <string id="6019411">Hope no one else needs this.</string>
  <string id="6019412">This will help. It better.</string>
  <string id="6019422">I can't move!</string>
  <string id="6019423">Something has me!</string>
  <string id="6019424">I am bound! Here!</string>
  <string id="6019428">I can't keep this pace.</string>
  <string id="6019429">I am... out of breath.</string>
  <string id="6019430">This is wearing on me.</string>
  <string id="6019440">I am losing ground.</string>
  <string id="6019441">I need help here!</string>
  <string id="6019442">Back me up or you lose me!</string>
  <string id="6019446">Order will be restored!</string>
  <string id="6019447">No more!</string>
  <string id="6019448">One less against us!</string>
  <string id="6019449">Hard won and deserved!</string>
  <string id="6019450">Done and down!</string>
  <string id="6019454">This isn't working!</string>
  <string id="6019455">My attack has done nothing!</string>
  <string id="6019456">Maker, why isn't this working!</string>
  <string id="6019460">Get me closer to them!</string>
  <string id="6019461">Let me close with them!</string>
  <string id="6019462">They are too far away!</string>
  <string id="6019466">More coming!</string>
  <string id="6019467">Reinforcements!</string>
  <string id="6019468">Guard yourself, there's more coming!</string>
  <string id="6019472">I am ready. They are not.</string>
  <string id="6019473">Stand ready. They come.</string>
  <string id="6019474">A last resort, if I have anything to say about it.</string>
  <string id="6019475">So it begins, and ends.</string>
  <string id="6019476">Let them join the Maker.</string>
  <string id="6019480">They will wish I stayed down!</string>
  <string id="6019481">A second chance... I'll take it!</string>
  <string id="6019482">Rest assured, I will not fall again!</string>
  <string id="6019483">Better than ever. Let's go!</string>
  <string id="6019484">I'm up, and there will be a reckoning!</string>
  <string id="6019488">Not one more!</string>
  <string id="6019489">That will not go unanswered!</string>
  <string id="6019490">I will not lose another in my care!</string>
  <string id="6019491">You will take no more of us. No more!</string>
  <string id="6019492">I won't let you down! Hold on!</string>
  <string id="6019496">You go through me before anyone else!</string>
  <string id="6019497">Face me, I stand for all of us!</string>
  <string id="6019498">Here! Come on!</string>
  <string id="6019502">Don't worry, I am at your back!</string>
  <string id="6019503">Hold steady, I will assist!</string>
  <string id="6019504">I'm with you, hold on!</string>
  <string id="6019508">I'm no good limping along like this.</string>
  <string id="6019509">You need my best. Deal with these injuries.</string>
  <string id="6019510">Leave me like this and the next injury may not be as treatable.</string>
  <string id="6019511">Tend this injury. I have to be ready for anything.</string>
  <string id="6019512">I'm not fully recovered. Not yet.</string>
  <string id="6019516">Well... next?</string>
  <string id="6019517">We walk way, but don't get full of yourself.</string>
  <string id="6019518">It was their bad luck we're so skilled.</string>
  <string id="6019519">A waste of life, but not my choice.</string>
  <string id="6019520">Every battle is training for the next.</string>
  <string id="6019524">Everyone all right? I think I was... out.</string>
  <string id="6019525">Word of caution, let's not to that again.</string>
  <string id="6019526">I think I tore... everything.</string>
  <string id="6019527">That could have gone better.</string>
  <string id="6019528">It will take a week to walk this off.</string>
  <string id="6019532">I'll need more than high hopes to do that.</string>
  <string id="6019533">That's unlikely, and you know it.</string>
  <string id="6019534">I wouldn't waste time trying.</string>
  <string id="6019538">Someone set a trap.</string>
  <string id="6019539">Trap here. I know it.</string>
  <string id="6019540">Watch well, there is a trap.</string>
  <string id="6019544">It's done.</string>
  <string id="6019545">I'm through, here.</string>
  <string id="6019546">Done here. Anything else?</string>
  <string id="6019550">I'm better at that.</string>
  <string id="6019551">Let me know if you need that done right.</string>
  <string id="6019552">I can help, you know.</string>
  <string id="6019608">I've got this one!</string>
  <string id="6019609">Take this!</string>
  <string id="6019610">You want this?</string>
  <string id="6019611">I will show you!</string>
  <string id="6019612">Think you're tough? I'm tough!</string>
  <string id="6019613">Watch this one!</string>
  <string id="6019614">Here's a good one!</string>
  <string id="6019615">Gonna put you down!</string>
  <string id="6019616">Thrilling the crowd!</string>
  <string id="6019617">This will be easy!</string>
  <string id="6019618">Maker and such!</string>
  <string id="6019619">Getting loud!</string>
  <string id="6019620">Ha HA!</string>
  <string id="6019621">You and me!</string>
  <string id="6019622">Mine!</string>
  <string id="6019626">I need... damn this, I need help!</string>
  <string id="6019627">All right, I need some help here!</string>
  <string id="6019628">What can I say, I need someone here!</string>
  <string id="6019632">Get around me. Regroup!</string>
  <string id="6019633">From here! We can regroup and do this!</string>
  <string id="6019634">To me! I have a good vantage!</string>
  <string id="6019638">Fine, going to try something else.</string>
  <string id="6019639">Guess I'll try... what, something else.</string>
  <string id="6019640">Come on, come on. Something else.</string>
  <string id="6019644">I need this, I'm taking it.</string>
  <string id="6019645">This will help, right. It better help!</string>
  <string id="6019646">You can spare this.</string>
  <string id="6019656">I can't move. I can't move!</string>
  <string id="6019657">What... let me go!</string>
  <string id="6019658">Something has me! Maker...!</string>
  <string id="6019662">Getting... getting tired of following you.</string>
  <string id="6019663">Tired. Too tired!</string>
  <string id="6019664">This better end soon. Can't keep pushing.</string>
  <string id="6019674">Hurting over here. Don't you see!</string>
  <string id="6019675">I need something! Getting hurt!</string>
  <string id="6019676">Wounded! Do something!</string>
  <string id="6019680">That was all me! Right there!</string>
  <string id="6019681">Who's laughing now, huh?</string>
  <string id="6019682">I did that! Right there!</string>
  <string id="6019683">Everyone see that? Down!</string>
  <string id="6019684">That's how we did it back in Ferelden!</string>
  <string id="6019688">This weapon is useless! Give me something good!</string>
  <string id="6019689">Blighted thing, I'm not getting through!</string>
  <string id="6019690">Nothing is happening. Nothing is happening!</string>
  <string id="6019694">Can't get there from here.</string>
  <string id="6019695">Too far. See?</string>
  <string id="6019696">With what? Too far!</string>
  <string id="6019700">More! There's more!</string>
  <string id="6019701">Look out, they've got back up!</string>
  <string id="6019702">They aren't stopping! More!</string>
  <string id="6019706">All right. Watch me.</string>
  <string id="6019707">I can do this. You'll see.</string>
  <string id="6019708">Time to prove something.</string>
  <string id="6019709">I'll show them what I can do.</string>
  <string id="6019710">You ready? I'm ready.</string>
  <string id="6019714">Okay, not over until... I say it's over.</string>
  <string id="6019715">I'm back up. Can't keep me down.</string>
  <string id="6019716">Not letting that happen again.</string>
  <string id="6019717">You had your chance. Now... I'm getting mad.</string>
  <string id="6019718">I wasn't completely down, I can still do this.</string>
  <string id="6019722">They can't do that! I won't let them do that!</string>
  <string id="6019723">How did that get by! Who let it happen!</string>
  <string id="6019724">No, no! Not while I'm here!</string>
  <string id="6019725">Get up! Don't do this, get up!</string>
  <string id="6019726">You'll be all right. Damn it, you'll be all right!</string>
  <string id="6019730">You think you're enough? Think you're tough?</string>
  <string id="6019731">I'm ready and waiting! Let's see what you have!</string>
  <string id="6019732">You and me and an audience, that's what this is all about!</string>
  <string id="6019736">Looks like you need a hand! On my way!</string>
  <string id="6019737">I can help, you'll see!</string>
  <string id="6019738">I'm coming, hang on!</string>
  <string id="6019742">You're going to let me walk around injured?</string>
  <string id="6019743">Do you have something for this, because it hurts.</string>
  <string id="6019744">How long do I limp around before you do something?</string>
  <string id="6019745">You making a point by letting me suffer like this?</string>
  <string id="6019746">Stop being you and fix me up.</string>
  <string id="6019750">You got us through that one. Good start.</string>
  <string id="6019751">We did it. Of course we did.</string>
  <string id="6019752">I suppose you helped that time. A little.</string>
  <string id="6019753">See what you can do, with me?</string>
  <string id="6019754">Couldn't have done it without me.</string>
  <string id="6019758">Always watching out for your little brother, huh.</string>
  <string id="6019759">Remind me why you're in charge?</string>
  <string id="6019760">This what I can expect from now on?</string>
  <string id="6019761">This new life we're after is a little underwhelming.</string>
  <string id="6019762">The part where it hurts is the worst. You know, all of it.</string>
  <string id="6019766">Since when can I do that?</string>
  <string id="6019767">Stop joking, I'm not doing it.</string>
  <string id="6019768">You think so? Not likely.</string>
  <string id="6019772">Trap there.</string>
  <string id="6019773">Watch yourself.</string>
  <string id="6019774">Someone left us a present.</string>
  <string id="6019778">Done with that.</string>
  <string id="6019779">A find job, if I say so. And I do.</string>
  <string id="6019780">Look at that. Perfect.</string>
  <string id="6019784">Need your little brother for that?</string>
  <string id="6019785">I thought the eldest was best at everything.</string>
  <string id="6019786">So you can't do everything.</string>
  <string id="6019867">Tal-Vashoth Leader</string>
  <string id="6019884">So, I've been dying to know: what was going through your head when you fought that ogre?</string>
  <string id="6019885">I barely noticed what it was. It stood in my way, so I killed it.</string>
  <string id="6019886">Bloodlust.</string>
  <string id="6019887">I knew that whatever happened, I had to get the others to safety.</string>
  <string id="6019888">Protecting my family.</string>
  <string id="6019889">For the first few seconds: what do they feed those things?</string>
  <string id="6019890">Maker, that's big!</string>
  <string id="6020055">You were too valuable for him to kill.</string>
  <string id="6020056">He wouldn't have done it.</string>
  <string id="6020057">Is that my choice? Prisoner or slave?</string>
  <string id="6020060">Huh. That must be convenient.</string>
  <string id="6020063">If I was wrong, you'd be dead... but so would an ugly gang of slavers.</string>
  <string id="6020064">Worth the risk.</string>
  <string id="6020065">Huh...</string>
  <string id="6020068">Who are you? Are you working for the templars?</string>
  <string id="6020069">Your mother sent me.</string>
  <string id="6020071">Hrmph. Hardly a difference.</string>
  <string id="6020074">You belong in the Circle of Magi.</string>
  <string id="6020075">She's right.</string>
  <string id="6020079">I can't believe her! My whole life, it was all, I'll love you and protect you. Then I have some bad dreams and it's, off to the templars!</string>
  <string id="6020082">Well, I'm not going. I was trying to get to the Dalish. They won't be afraid of my magic.</string>
  <string id="6020083">I'm here to help you, Feynriel.</string>
  <string id="6020084">Maybe there's another way.</string>
  <string id="6020085">Why? You don't even know me.</string>
  <string id="6020086">I am you.</string>
  <string id="6020087">I'm a mage.</string>
  <string id="6020088">I've spent my whole life protecting my sister from exactly what you fear.</string>
  <string id="6020089">My sister's a mage.</string>
  <string id="6020093">Locking mages up over an accident of birth is unjust.</string>
  <string id="6020094">It's not about you.</string>
  <string id="6020095">Well, my birth was certainly an accident.</string>
  <string id="6020098">If I weren't half human, we'd be living with the Dalish. I'd be trained by a Keeper, not hustled into the Gallows like a bad secret.</string>
  <string id="6020101">That's where I was trying to go. See if they would take me in. I'm as much Dalish as human.</string>
  <string id="6020388">You should take credit for those rules.</string>
  <string id="6020389">Good rules!</string>
  <string id="6020395">I guess you are.</string>
  <string id="6020398">You know, you're the first mage I've met. Most are locked up like lepers.</string>
  <string id="6020403">Would... is there any chance you'd help me reach the Dalish?</string>
  <string id="6020412">Was your mother right? Are you plagued by demons already?</string>
  <string id="6020413">What about your nightmares?</string>
  <string id="6020414">I can't say for sure. I have... dreams.</string>
  <string id="6020417">There are voices in the dreams. They ask me to come, to give shape to the Void around them.</string>
  <string id="6020420">But the Dalish Keeper is wise. If anyone can help, she can.</string>
  <string id="6020421">Eh, at least if you go nuts out with the elves, you won't be killing any of us.</string>
  <string id="6020422">Do what you think is best.</string>
  <string id="6020423">Enough discussion. You want the elves, then go fast, before the templars find you.</string>
  <string id="6020424">Do what you think is best.</string>
  <string id="6020425">Th-thank you! I did not... in my wildest dreams, I could not have foreseen this.</string>
  <string id="6020428">Thank the Creators you were the one my mother hired to find me. I will forever be in your debt, friend.</string>
  <string id="6020429">Sorry, friend, but it's time to get familiar with the Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6020430">Go to the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6020431">I was hired to bring you to the Circle, and that's where you're going.</string>
  <string id="6020432">Go to the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6020433">I saw what you did to those Tevinters.</string>
  <string id="6020436">I cannot hope to fight you.</string>
  <string id="6020439">Fine! Go get your blood money, tell my mother she won. But she'll be the only one I don't miss when they lock me away.</string>
  <string id="6020445">Has the Keeper been able to help with your magic?</string>
  <string id="6020446">How are the nightmares?</string>
  <string id="6020447">Sadly, his is not a problem we've encountered before. I'm studying our ancient writings, but it is a slow process.</string>
  <string id="6020450">His human blood makes it difficult to train him.</string>
  <string id="6020453">You know, when I lived in Kirkwall, I felt like everyone could tell by my face I was an elf.</string>
  <string id="6020456"> Now I understand how easily I passed. It's harder here.</string>
  <string id="6020459">Getting sick of all the elves?</string>
  <string id="6020460">Are you sorry you came?</string>
  <string id="6020461">It's better than the Circle, but... we haven't made as much progress as I hoped.</string>
  <string id="6020464">I'm busy right now.</string>
  <string id="6020465">No time to talk.</string>
  <string id="6020466">Very well.</string>
  <string id="6020469">Still, we appreciate you bringing him here, friend. We would not see a son of our tribe suffer alone. Please accept this as our thanks.</string>
  <string id="6020472">If I don't get better soon, I shall be made Tranquil.</string>
  <string id="6020473">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6020474">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6020483">Another nightmare. They just keep getting worse.</string>
  <string id="6020484">Your son has taken refuge with the Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6020485">Your son has gone to master his talents at the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6020488">Well, he went kicking and screaming, but your boy is at the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6020491">Feynriel's at the Circle. Pay up.</string>
  <string id="6020496">Your son decided he'd rather be an elf than a templar prisoner. He joined the Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6020499">Your son is with the Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6020502">But they do value magic more than the men of Kirkwall. Perhaps he can have both safety and freedom...</string>
  <string id="6020515">Captain Reiner</string>
  <string id="6020517">Sailor</string>
  <string id="6020521">Captured Mage</string>
  <string id="6020525">Thank you for bringing Feynriel to the Circle. He is resentful still, but it is the only place he can master his demons.</string>
  <string id="6020526">The Circle exists for a reason.</string>
  <string id="6020527">It is the best place for him.</string>
  <string id="6020528">Magic must serve man, not rule him. Thank you friend.</string>
  <string id="6020529">We have found neither hide nor hair of the lad Feynriel. I can only think he has fallen victim to demons or slavers.</string>
  <string id="6020530">He has gone to his mother's people to learn their ways of controlling magic.</string>
  <string id="6020531">He is with the Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6020532">I had not realized the Dalish took in half-bloods.</string>
  <string id="6020535">It is an interesting solution. And well out of our hands now.</string>
  <string id="6020536">I found this. It was addressed to you. It seems to be from your daughter.</string>
  <string id="6020537">I have a letter for you.</string>
  <string id="6020538">My daughter! Then... you know what she is. How she died...</string>
  <string id="6020541">When I traced her to that warehouse... I should have forced her into the Circle. My own weakness in the face of her pleas is what destroyed her.</string>
  <string id="6020544">It is why I urged Arianni not to give in when Feynriel wished to hide. If only I had been so strong for Olivia.</string>
  <string id="6020545">You have my sympathies. Do not fear the templars finding out.</string>
  <string id="6020546">I'll keep your secret.</string>
  <string id="6020547">I will tell no one what became of her.</string>
  <string id="6020548">I'll keep your secret.</string>
  <string id="6020549">Thank you. She is at peace now. I would not wish to see her name smeared while her ashes are still warm.</string>
  <string id="6020550">So, is this a bad time to say, Two gold a week for the next year or the templars get a copy of that letter?</string>
  <string id="6020551">Pay me, or I'll expose you.</string>
  <string id="6020552">She was an abomination. She deserved to die. And you'd better pay up if you don't want this getting out.</string>
  <string id="6020553">Pay me, or I'll expose you.</string>
  <string id="6020554">You monster!</string>
  <string id="6020557">Fine! Money is what you wish, to avoid dragging my Olivia's name through the mud? You shall have it! Now begone!</string>
  <string id="6020558">Fare you well, Ser Thrask.</string>
  <string id="6020559">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="6020560">You as well, friend.</string>
  <string id="6020561">Abomination</string>
  <string id="6020567">Quickly, before they regroup. We must press towards the Wilds!</string>
  <string id="6020580">Keeper Marethari</string>
  <string id="6020609">If I said that, I'd be full of shit. When you say it, I almost believe it.</string>
  <string id="6020610">Lots of people talk about nobility and selflessness... generally in the same stories that have magic beans.</string>
  <string id="6020611">Laughs I don't know anyone else that's even seen one. You're lucky just to be standing here.</string>
  <string id="6020613">You think you know it all, don't you?</string>
  <string id="6020651">The Bone Pit's hazardous at best. And if the dragons return...</string>
  <string id="6020652">They won't be safe!</string>
  <string id="6020653">I got all the dragons. Should be safe enough for now.</string>
  <string id="6020654">It should be fine.</string>
  <string id="6020656">That sounds good to me.</string>
  <string id="6020657">I accept.</string>

  <string id="6020704">Thug Leader</string>
  <string id="6020715">Greetings, partner. Business is good!</string>
  <string id="6020744">Let us discuss your payment. You have been a great help.</string>
  <string id="6020760">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6020762">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6020764">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6020774">True. It is surely not in the lad's bests interests to turn away anyone who seeks to find him.</string>
  <string id="6020777">You win no friends with that tone. But perhaps it is in the lad's best interest to have another defender right now.</string>
  <string id="6020783">What kind of price?</string>
  <string id="6020784">How's this?</string>
  <string id="6020785">I'll pay you in silver.</string>
  <string id="6020786">Help me, and you don't end up dead.</string>
  <string id="6020787">Your life.</string>
  <string id="6020788">The Maker don't look kindly on them who tease broken old men.</string>
  <string id="6020875">Orwald the Braggart</string>

  <string id="6020881">Ser Varnell</string>
  <string id="6020885">Qunari Delegate</string>
  <string id="6020911">Guardsman Maecon</string>
  <string id="6020921">Saemus</string>
  <string id="6020925">Do you think they would have me?</string>
  <string id="6020937">You've returned. Have you thought about my offer?</string>
  <string id="6020938">Sorry, but I can't help you right now.</string>
  <string id="6020939">It's still no.</string>
  <string id="6020949">Grand Cleric Elthina</string>
  <string id="6020960">Viscount Dumar</string>
  <string id="6020962">Then why are you here?</string>
  <string id="6020978">Mercenary</string>
  <string id="6020988">Mercenary</string>
  <string id="6020992">Are you the templar who is pursuing the boy Feynriel?</string>
  <string id="6020993">Shepherding Wolves</string>
  <string id="6021009">A Chantry sister has been lured into a Lowtown alley. Follow to see if she needs help.</string>
  <string id="6021016">Which Plot?</string>
  <string id="6021035">The Chantry sister is waiting in a safehouse near the Lowtown Bazaar.</string>
  <string id="6021064">Leave Petrice’s safehouse through the trapdoor, and guide the Qunari mage through Darktown.</string>
  <string id="6021070">Return to Petrice at her safehouse in Lowtown to discuss the Qunari ambush.</string>
  <string id="6021085">Somehow, Hawke, I imagine things won't be dull with you around.</string>
  <string id="6021109">Not that we're lacking excitement right now.</string>
  <string id="6021110">Not that I expect the Deep Roads to be boring, mind you. Constant threat of doom does tend to keep you awake.</string>
  <string id="6021116">What about you? Been in any good battles?</string>
  <string id="6021117">Have any war stories?</string>
  <string id="6021118">What are the Deep Roads like?</string>
  <string id="6021119">Have you been there?</string>
  <string id="6021120">A lot of things can keep you awake, you know. I wouldn't reach for the doom first.</string>
  <string id="6021121">So does insomnia.</string>
  <string id="6021133">To understand Bartrand, you've got to understand the Dwarven Merchants Guild.</string>
  <string id="6021134">True enough. I suppose you ought to know my credentials.</string>
  <string id="6021135">Bartrand's running the show. Andraste's ass, he'd probably do that even if we weren't paying for everything.</string>
  <string id="6021202">I was hoping you would come. You did so much for my Feynriel already, but...</string>
  <string id="6021205">He refuses to see me, but I know he's chafing at the Circle's ways that keep the demons from him.</string>
  <string id="6021209">Feynriel has never needed a friend more.</string>
  <string id="6021210">I will do it.</string>
  <string id="6021211">Ooh, it's not often you get to submit and still come out the hero.</string>
  <string id="6021212">I will do it.</string>
  <string id="6021213">Does that mean you'll do it? Oh, thank you.</string>
  <string id="6021216">I've already called for the Keeper. We need to begin the ritual as quickly as possible.</string>
  <string id="6021219">Would you like to stay here or return when she arrives?</string>
  <string id="6021220">This is too urgent to delay.</string>
  <string id="6021221">I'm ready to start.</string>
  <string id="6021222">You have been far kinder than I had any right to expect.</string>
  <string id="6021223">I've got a few things to finish first.</string>
  <string id="6021224">I'll come back later.</string>
  <string id="6021225">Yes. I suggest you settle your affairs. Once you are in the Fade, the only way to emerge is with my son.</string>
  <string id="6021226">It seems risky. I would not like to be stuck in the Fade.</string>
  <string id="6021227">I don't know...</string>
  <string id="6021228">Keeper Marethari says that if Feynriel is... possessed, the abomination could destroy half the city.</string>
  <string id="6021231">Please. She will try the ritual anyway, but you are its best chance of success.</string>
  <string id="6021234">At least talk to her. Perhaps she can convince you better than me.</string>
  <string id="6021237">Coterie Barker</string>
  <string id="6021239">The Fade is a place for mages, not for people like you and I.</string>
  <string id="6021242">Perhaps this is something best left to the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6021245">The Fade, huh? Don't know how much help I'd be to you there.</string>
  <string id="6021248">The Keeper will delve into the ancient magics to protect this half-breed? She wouldn't do so for me.</string>
  <string id="6021251">You'll need someone experienced in the Fade to come with you.</string>
  <string id="6021274">The magic he possesses makes him what the Tevinters called somniari, a dreamer.</string>
  <string id="6021275">What can a dreamer do?</string>
  <string id="6021276">A dreamer?</string>
  <string id="6021295">Now, gather a team and we will begin. Choose carefully, for all will face temptation.</string>
  <string id="6021301">So, if I do your ritual, I assume there's some kind of... reward?</string>
  <string id="6021302">Why should I do this?</string>
  <string id="6021327">Void take us all! Hawke is down!</string>
  <string id="6021331">Damn you, Hawke! You can't die on me yet!</string>
  <string id="6021335">Hawke! Hang in there, I'll get you out of here!</string>
  <string id="6021338">I never give in to temptation.</string>
  <string id="6021341">I worry what a journey to the Fade might bring out in me.</string>
  <string id="6021344">Can I come? I'd love see the ritual! And I promise I won't be a bother!</string>
  <string id="6021347">I can't imagine what aid I could offer in a realm of dreams and magic.</string>
  <string id="6021350">I have no desire to explore the Fade, but if you need me I will go.</string>
  <string id="6021353">I admit... I'm a little fascinated.</string>
  <string id="6021356">Let us begin.</string>
  <string id="6021667">Well... it's rare to see two forgotten magics in one day.</string>
  <string id="6021686">Speak. But I promise nothing.</string>
  <string id="6021687">I'm listening.</string>
  <string id="6021688">I will not give in to temptation, fiend!</string>
  <string id="6021689">I don't work with demons.</string>
  <string id="6021690">Have it your way.</string>
  <string id="6021992">Undercity Thug</string>
  <string id="6022317">Outside Smuggler's Cut</string>
  <string id="6022533">Mercenary</string>
  <string id="6022537">Lead the Qunari mage out of Darktown.</string>
  <string id="6022555">Return to Petrice at her safehouse at night in Lowtown to discuss the Qunari ambush.</string>
  <string id="6022562">Mother said our family was wealthy. You really can't help us?</string>
  <string id="6022563">So there's no family fortune?</string>
  <string id="6022564">I am blighted helping! I've got two offers of work from people who've got the coin to open those gates.</string>
  <string id="6022567">I still can't believe you sold the estate. Gamlen, how could you?</string>
  <string id="6022570">Well, I didn't expect your blasted family to show up on my doorstep. I've got a nice place in Lowtown. You'll see. It'll all work out!</string>
  <string id="6022740">What human wanted to merge with a prig like that? Where were we?</string>

  <string id="6023673">Convince Bartrand to change his mind. The expedition into the Deep Roads is a vital quest.</string>
  <string id="6023821">Do whatever makes you happy.</string>
  <string id="6023822">Go with him, son.</string>
  <string id="6023831">Why are you lying to me?</string>
  <string id="6023834">Your father never wanted anything to do with you. Don't trust him.</string>
  <string id="6023835">He abandoned you.</string>
  <string id="6023862">Petrice's Safehouse</string>
  <string id="6023866">I can't spend another moment in this place. The screaming! Everywhere, all I hear are the nightmares of people dying, fleeing, gnawing their own arms off to escape...</string>
  <string id="6023872">It is unpleasant and difficult, but it is right.</string>
  <string id="6023873">Is this truly necessary?</string>
  <string id="6023877">Screams</string>
  <string id="6023880">What's happening? This is still the Fade!</string>
  <string id="6023883">Hush, son. The Fade isn't all bad. You're safe here.</string>
  <string id="6023886">Wait. I know you. You saved me from those slavers. Are you a dream?</string>
  <string id="6023887">You have the power to leave the Fade. Open your eyes.</string>
  <string id="6023888">You must wake up.</string>
  <string id="6023889">Don't tell him that!</string>
  <string id="6023890">Yes, a lovely dream. Just close your eyes and open yourself to the Fade.</string>
  <string id="6023891">You're safe.</string>
  <string id="6023892">I am tired. It has been a... trying night.</string>
  <string id="6023895">At last, I am complete!</string>
  <string id="6023898">At last, I have a—</string>
  <string id="6023901">No! This mind is in tatters. Shadows everywhere, screaming... There is no place for me here.</string>
  <string id="6023931">Wayward Son</string>
  <string id="6023947">Survivors are finally creeping out. Thank you, Messere Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6023951">I'm not sure if this is real. If so, it is the second time I owe you my life.</string>
  <string id="6023954">The Fade feels different now. I see the stitches, the seams holding it together. I feel I could wake at any moment.</string>
  <string id="6023957">The Circle will only fear me more if I reveal what I can do. I cannot stay there.</string>
  <string id="6023960">The Dalish do not have what I need.</string>
  <string id="6023963">Perhaps is not a plan. Who faces his next demon?</string>
  <string id="6023966">This is a far cry from the sniveling boy we pulled from those slavers. He may be ready.</string>
  <string id="6023969">My mother would not look kindly on such a journey. Can you give her my farewell?</string>
  <string id="6023970">May the Maker guide your path, Feynriel.</string>
  <string id="6023971">I will.</string>
  <string id="6023972">I can't trust that you will never give in to these temptations. I cannot allow you to live with this power.</string>
  <string id="6023973">You cannot go.</string>
  <string id="6023974">You save me for this? Why? Why!</string>
  <string id="6023985">You can master this talent, Feynriel. You don't have to let it destroy you.</string>
  <string id="6023986">I won't kill you.</string>
  <string id="6023987">Perhaps... there is a way out of this.</string>

  <string id="6024004">Go to the side alley off Lowtown to find the elf that tried killing Javaris.</string>
  <string id="6024005">Find a way to stop the poison from spreading.</string>
  <string id="6024077">You... I've been looking for you. I wanted to thank you for saving me.</string>
  <string id="6024080">My mother says this time, you didn't care, but I don't need you. I am who I was meant to be!</string>
  <string id="6024083">Find a way to become a partner to get the Deep Roads expedition started. It is a vital quest.</string>
  <string id="6024090">Feynriel has mastered his powers.</string>
  <string id="6024093">Then he lives? You saved him? I cannot thank you enough!</string>
  <string id="6024100">Feynriel is Tranquil. I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6024103">Tranquil! But he said he would rather die than become a... walking statue!</string>
  <string id="6024106">It is a horrible fate. But sometimes the tribe must be weighed against one man's suffering.</string>
  <string id="6024109">I'm sorry... I wasn't able to save Feynriel.</string>
  <string id="6024112">What do you mean? Is he dead? My poor boy!</string>
  <string id="6024115">No. I see on your face it is worse. He gave in to the demons, did he not?</string>
  <string id="6024116">He has become an abomination.</string>
  <string id="6024117">He's a monster.</string>
  <string id="6024118">No! My poor boy! This magic is a curse. Would that the Creators had given him a normal life!</string>
  <string id="6024121">I should warn the Circle. They must know what creature they now harbor in their midst.</string>
  <string id="6024124">And his body lay in the Sundermount, guarded by my tribe. I must return before he awakens!</string>
  <string id="6024128">Don't blame Feynriel. I am the one who was weak.</string>
  <string id="6024129">It's my fault.</string>
  <string id="6024130">I am sure you did all you could. It was a mad hope, beyond any chance for success.</string>
  <string id="6024422">Speak to Thrask in the Gallows Courtyard or Vincento in the Lowtown Market during the day about the boy, Feynriel.</string>
  <string id="6024425">Return to Arianni in Lowtown during the day to tell her that Feynriel is with the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6024426">Return to Arianni in Lowtown during the day to tell her that Feynriel went to the Dalish.&#13;
</string>
  <string id="6024427">Feynriel is safe, for now.</string>
  <string id="6024435">Mage and Templar Debug Conversation. What would you like to do?</string>
  <string id="6024439">Wayward Son</string>
  <string id="6024440">Wayward Son</string>
  <string id="6024441">Where in the plot?</string>
  <string id="6024442">Start of the plot.</string>

  <string id="6024521">Meeting Vincento</string>
  <string id="6024522">I visited him among the People, but he turned me away. I know the demons still plague him.</string>
  <string id="6024525">And now they've taken him! Two days ago, Feynriel went into a nightmare and hasn't returned. </string>
  <string id="6024526">He can't be woken up?</string>
  <string id="6024527">A nightmare?</string>
  <string id="6024528">Ser Thrask tells me he lies like the dead. He barely breaths.</string>
  <string id="6024529">The Keeper says he is near death. His lips still fog a mirror, but that is all.</string>
  <string id="6024530">Surely there are mages who can pursue him in the Fade.</string>
  <string id="6024531">Has anyone gone after him?</string>
  <string id="6024535">I have contacted Keeper Marethari. The Dalish have an ancient ritual that might help.</string>
  <string id="6024538">But it requires someone Feynriel trusts to enter the Fade to free him.</string>
  <string id="6024539">This is hardly my area of expertise, but is there anything I can do?</string>
  <string id="6024540">How can I help?</string>
  <string id="6024541">I have braved the Fade before. Perhaps I can aid him.</string>
  <string id="6024542">How can I help?</string>
  <string id="6024543">You have been so kind to us. Feynriel thinks of you as a true friend.</string>
  <string id="6024546">So you're, what? Hoping I can yell really loudly in his ear? Maybe give him a good shake?</string>
  <string id="6024547">What do you want from me?</string>
  <string id="6024548">I'm hoping you can reach him. You made a strong impression when you rescued him from the slavers.</string>
  <string id="6024551">I did some work for you. That doesn't make me your boy's best friend.</string>
  <string id="6024552">Why call me?</string>
  <string id="6024553">You may not think so, but I believe Feynriel does.</string>
  <string id="6024556">My Dalish friends tell me he speaks of you all the time.</string>
  <string id="6024559">Ser Thrask told me that Feynriel speaks of you with great respect.</string>
  <string id="6024562">The Keeper says Feynriel's powers are a throwback to ancient magics that once let elves shape the Fade. The only way to reach him is through his dreams.</string>
  <string id="6024563">How would such a magic work?</string>
  <string id="6024564">Shape the Fade?</string>
  <string id="6024565">I am no mage. I only know the Keeper said it was a power greatly feared by the Tevinter magisters.</string>
  <string id="6024566">If there is a way I can help, I will do it.</string>
  <string id="6024567">Tell me what you need.</string>
  <string id="6024568">Well, all right... I could use a nap.</string>
  <string id="6024569">Inside his dreams?</string>
  <string id="6024570">It is not enough for you to dream. You must enter the Fade as a mage does.</string>
  <string id="6024573">Fade's a big place, you know. Got any landmarks?</string>
  <string id="6024574">How do I find him?</string>
  <string id="6024575">I'm not afraid of demons.</string>
  <string id="6024576">That doesn't scare me.</string>
  <string id="6024577">Keeper Marethari thinks an ancient Dalish ritual can help free Feynriel. But someone he trusts must enter the Fade to guide him out.</string>
  <string id="6024580">Marethari is coming to perform the ritual that will bring Feynriel back. His childhood things here will help anchor him.</string>
  <string id="6024583">Are you willing to submit to her magic to save my son?</string>
  <string id="6024584">What does the ritual entail?</string>
  <string id="6024585">What will I have to do?</string>
  <string id="6024785">Speak to Bartrand in Hightown's Merchants Guild to get the expedition started, but be sure to wrap up remaining business in the city first.</string>
  <string id="6024801">Expedition Hireling</string>
  <string id="6024951">Lowtown</string>
  <string id="6024961">Maker's blessing on you.</string>
  <string id="6024969">They sailed north across the Waking Sea, lashed by terrible storms.</string>
  <string id="6024972">The Keeper can explain it better than I. Her ritual will send you into the Fade.</string>
  <string id="6024975">Once there, I imagine you... face down the demons until Feynriel regains control of himself.</string>
  <string id="6024978">You will be unable to return from the Fade until he does.</string>
  <string id="6024979">It was truly the Creators who put you in the alienage that day.</string>
  <string id="6024984">I would not see the demons acquire a new source of power.</string>
  <string id="6024985">I will do it.</string>
  <string id="6024986">I know his power makes him dangerous, but please... it's not Feynriel's fault. Be gentle with him.</string>
  <string id="6024987">Submitting has never been my strong suit.</string>
  <string id="6024988">I don't know...</string>
  <string id="6024989">Saving your boy's life isn't worth risking my own.</string>
  <string id="6024990">I don't know...</string>
  <string id="6025005">Speak to Samson about Feynriel. Samson is usually loitering in the lower reaches of Lowtown at night.</string>
  <string id="6025010">Directions to Arlan</string>
  <string id="6025012">Undercity Warrens</string>
  <string id="6025025">Thank the Creators you came back in time. Marethari's here!</string>
  <string id="6025028">We've been ratted out! Get them!</string>
  <string id="6025082">The treasure we found in the Deep Roads made us a fortune.</string>
  <string id="6025085">The Champion moved up in the world. Literally. Bought a mansion in Hightown.</string>
  <string id="6025088">Everyone knew who he was now. Even the viscount was taking notice.</string>
  <string id="6025091">Everyone knew who she was now. Even the viscount was taking notice.</string>
  <string id="6025094">The Grey Wardens left Kirkwall. It was months before we learned Carver survived.</string>
  <string id="6025097">The Grey Wardens left Kirkwall. It was months before we learned Bethany survived.</string>
  <string id="6025100">Carver joined the templars, just as he said he would. He didn't turn in the Champion, at least.</string>
  <string id="6025103">Bethany was in the Circle, now. There was nothing we could do for her, poor girl.</string>
  <string id="6025106">I felt responsible for Carver's death. He was a good lad, and met a bad end.</string>
  <string id="6025109">I felt responsible for Bethany's death. She was a good girl, and met a bad end.</string>
  <string id="6025112">Three years later, the Qunari still hadn't left.</string>
  <string id="6025115">They were becoming a problem. But how does one ask a hundred angry giants to just leave?</string>
  <string id="6025118">The Qunari insisted they were waiting for their ship. But some of us knew better...</string>
  <string id="6025121">Champion of Kirkwall, that was the reward. A fine title.</string>
  <string id="6025124">Every noble at the Keep owed the Champion their lives.</string>
  <string id="6025127">He wasn't just a hero; he was now the most important person in the city.</string>
  <string id="6025130">She wasn't just a hero; she was now the most important person in the city.</string>
  <string id="6025133">Except for Knight-Commander Meredith, of course. With the viscount dead, she stepped in to keep order.</string>
  <string id="6025136">Things quickly got out of hand.</string>
  <string id="6025139">The more she squeezed the mages, the more they resisted. The more they resisted, the tighter she squeezed.</string>
  <string id="6025142">After three years of that, it all came crashing down.</string>
  <string id="6025145">Dreamers are unique for their ability to enter the Fade at will, without the aid of lyrium.</string>
  <string id="6025148">In the Fade, they can shape dreams and even affect the world beyond the Veil.</string>
  <string id="6025151">Tevinter somniari used to enter the minds of sleepers and slay them in their dreams.</string>
  <string id="6025152">Why are they so rare?</string>
  <string id="6025153">First to survive?</string>
  <string id="6025154">Dreamers have great power in the Fade. They attract demons.</string>
  <string id="6025157">Luckily, most prove too frail of mind to survive a demon's possession. A dreamer-abomination would be near unstoppable.</string>
  <string id="6025161">What exactly are we going to do here?</string>
  <string id="6025162">Tell me about the ritual.</string>
  <string id="6025163">Just send me into the Fade.</string>
  <string id="6025164">Let's start the ritual.</string>
  <string id="6025304">The elves of the Dales were experts in the somniari arts. They could even help those with no power enter the Fade.</string>
  <string id="6025307">I have done my best to recreate the ritual.</string>
  <string id="6025310">We will use Feynriel's childhood home as a focus to draw him back through the Veil.</string>
  <string id="6025311">I told you he was amazing!</string>
  <string id="6025314">I told you her courage was legendary!</string>
  <string id="6025317">We will live. If that is not reward enough, perhaps you will accept the tome where I found this ritual.</string>
  <string id="6025323">It should prove valuable to your own studies of magic.</string>
  <string id="6025326">It should bring a fair price from the mages of the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6025329">Now, Arianni, please excuse us. We must prepare.</string>
  <string id="6025332">Oh, of course.</string>
  <string id="6025335">There is more I must tell you that is not for her ears.</string>
  <string id="6025338">Dreamers have the power to control the Beyond, what humans call the Fade. Feynriel is the first in two ages to survive.</string>
  <string id="6025339">Is there a difference between the Beyond and the Fade?</string>
  <string id="6025340">The Beyond?</string>
  <string id="6025341">They are the same. By either name, the Fade is the realm of spirits, Thedas's heart, while the mortal realm is its strong arm.</string>
  <string id="6025344">The demons who live there covet the bodies of mortals and seek to possess them.</string>
  <string id="6025347">Only mages ever touch the Fade in a waking state. Others see it in dreams.</string>
  <string id="6025349">Is Feynriel in danger?</string>
  <string id="6025350">About her son?</string>
  <string id="6025351">Indeed. And the danger may not come from what you think.</string>
  <string id="6025354">You're really not my type.</string>
  <string id="6025355">You just want me alone.</string>
  <string id="6025356">This is a serious matter.</string>
  <string id="6025359">I want to get this over with.</string>
  <string id="6025360">Make it quick.</string>
  <string id="6025361">Feynriel cannot become an abomination. The destruction he would cause is unimaginable.</string>
  <string id="6025364">If you cannot save him from the demons, you must kill him yourself.</string>
  <string id="6025367">A death in the Fade will make him what your Circle calls Tranquil. He will be no threat after.</string>
  <string id="6025369">Speak to Samson about Feynriel. Samson is usually loitering in the lower reaches of Lowtown at night.</string>
  <string id="6025370">Thrask's journal mentions Samson, a templar who loiters in the lower reaches of Lowtown most nights.</string>
  <string id="6025371">Hubert</string>

  <string id="6025546">Arthuris's Private Dock</string>

  <string id="6025782">Bring Kelder to the guards outside the ruin.</string>
  <string id="6025783">Magistrate Vanard vows revenge for his son's death.</string>
  <string id="6025784">Magistrate Vanard offered a generous reward for returning his son. He is near the chantry during the day.</string>
  <string id="6025798">I will not let him become a danger.</string>
  <string id="6025799">I understand.</string>
  <string id="6025800">I wish you luck.</string>
  <string id="6025803">That's Feynriel's greatest fear. I won't be the one to make it come true.</string>
  <string id="6025804">I can't do that.</string>
  <string id="6025805">I have no choice but to leave it in your hands.</string>

  <string id="6025899">City Guardsman</string>
  <string id="6025978">It's usually a slow place, the Fade, not many surprises. I wasn't sure I'd like this one... but it has potential.</string>
  <string id="6025981">Do not trust it. It is a thing that will lure you in, if it can.</string>
  <string id="6025984">A demon of sloth. It exists to make men forget their purpose and their pride—do not relax around it!</string>
  <string id="6025987">A sloth demon. Think active thoughts! Like... running and jumping and such.</string>
  <string id="6025990">I never thought demons were the chit-chat types.</string>
  <string id="6025993">What are you, creature? Why do you speak to us?</string>
  <string id="6025996">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="6025999">Call me Torpor. I have a proposition that might interest you.</string>
  <string id="6026016">Allow me to commend your daughter's soul to the Maker, Mistress.</string>
  <string id="6026079">Ruined Passage</string>
  <string id="6026084">But it's not. Some of you lot might have legitimate business in the city.</string>
  <string id="6026099">Lia</string>
  <string id="6026128">Kelder</string>
  <string id="6026174">But... what about the estate? Surely Father left something when he died.</string>
  <string id="6026177">Right, about the estate... It's, uh, gone. To settle a debt. I've been meaning to write you.</string>
  <string id="6026180">Then there's no hope.</string>
  <string id="6026184">And what of me? I will not allow others to incur debts on my behalf.</string>
  <string id="6026187">Can't see that it makes a difference. You look like a lady who can pull her own weight.</string>
  <string id="6026190">Then you'll come with us.</string>
  <string id="6026199">I... have no real option. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6026200">We cut down dozens of darkspawn and an ogre to get here. That has to count for something.</string>
  <string id="6026201">This will not stand in my way.</string>
  <string id="6026202">So you're selling us into indentured servitude? That's your idea?</string>
  <string id="6026203">This is the best you could do?</string>
  <string id="6026204">I'm sure we'll be free and clear before we know it.</string>
  <string id="6026205">So what's a year?</string>
  <string id="6026217">What do you think about this, Carver?</string>
  <string id="6026218">Carver?</string>
  <string id="6026225">What can I say? Better here than nowhere.</string>
  <string id="6026227">Tell the magistrate what has transpired. He is near the chantry during the day.</string>
  <string id="6026234">Tell me, how did your family escape Lothering? Almost everyone who hadn't fled...</string>
  <string id="6026237">My brother. If he wasn't with us, I don't think we'd be here.</string>
  <string id="6026240">My older sister. If she wasn't with us, I don't think we'd be here.</string>
  <string id="6026243">But you seem quite skilled as well.</string>
  <string id="6026246">I'm not my brother.</string>
  <string id="6026249">I'm not my sister.</string>
  <string id="6026933">Are you a demon?</string>
  <string id="6026934">What are you?</string>
  <string id="6026935">That is the term humans give us. We existed first, though, so that seems slightly unfair.</string>
  <string id="6026942">I trust you're here for the mage, Feynriel? Two of the most powerful demons in this realm are vying for control of him.</string>
  <string id="6026948">Sadly, I'm no warrior. I couldn't stand up to them. But if I did, I'd only want the boy's power to secure my position in the Fade.</string>
  <string id="6026951">Don't listen to him. Sloth demons prey on your trust!</string>
  <string id="6026954">I'd be no threat to your world.</string>
  <string id="6026955">So if I help you possess Feynriel, you won't attack Kirkwall?</string>
  <string id="6026956">What are you offering?</string>
  <string id="6026957">We are drawn to the mortal realm to merge with a living soul. Once I've done so, what need will I have for your people?</string>
  <string id="6026960">I merely want power against my own kind.</string>
  <string id="6026963">Bring me Feynriel, and I will grant anything you ask: power, magic, money, the strength of ten men!</string>
  <string id="6026966">This is a monster. It asks you to sacrifice an innocent to its ambition!</string>
  <string id="6026969">Ignore this tiresome little spirit. I ask only what it has already taken, a willing merger with a human host.</string>
  <string id="6026971">What sort of creatures are menacing Feynriel?</string>
  <string id="6026972">Tell me about the demons.</string>
  <string id="6026973">There is a demon of desire, called Caress. She ensnares him in dreams of bliss from which he will not emerge.</string>
  <string id="6026976">The other is a creature of pride, known as Wryme. It offers Feynriel the power to control his life and world.</string>
  <string id="6026977">What would it take to defeat these demons?</string>
  <string id="6026978">How can I save him?</string>
  <string id="6026979">They each weave an illusion for Feynriel. You must help him reject it.</string>
  <string id="6026982">But be cautious—shatter the dream too quickly, and his mind will break. He must reach the realization on his own.</string>
  <string id="6026983">Is there still time to save him?</string>
  <string id="6026984">How is Feynriel now?</string>
  <string id="6026985">He suffers under the demons' assault. Every time they strain his connection to the mortal world, his mind breaks a little further.</string>
  <string id="6026988">The pain of it shakes this entire realm.</string>
  <string id="6026989">Give me the reflexes of a wildcat, and I will take your deal.</string>
  <string id="6026990">I want agility.</string>
  <string id="6026991">Give me the strength to fight untiring and I will take your deal.</string>
  <string id="6026992">I want strength.</string>
  <string id="6026993">Give me the power to channel the Fade and I will take your deal.</string>
  <string id="6026994">I want magic.</string>
  <string id="6026995">Signed and sealed!</string>
  <string id="6026998">Be cautious. Demons don't always keep their promises.</string>
  <string id="6027001">You would deal with a demon.</string>
  <string id="6027004">And another falls prey to temptation.</string>
  <string id="6027007">Use those doors to enter the other parts of Feynriel's nightmare. You will take on the form of something he dreams.</string>
  <string id="6027010">Gently guide him out of temptation—if you disrupt him too quickly, his mind will snap.</string>
  <string id="6027013">Bring him to me, and power beyond dreams will be yours.</string>
  <string id="6027038">Don't fight me on this.</string>
  <string id="6027039">Back off, Anders!</string>
  <string id="6027040">Offered and Lost</string>
  <string id="6027043">Talk to Seneschal Bran in the Viscount's Keep for more information on the missing Qunari entourage.</string>
  <string id="6027044">My kind and this have been opposed since the beginning of time.</string>
  <string id="6027047">This is a creature of complacency! Of injustice! I cannot let you treat with it!</string>
  <string id="6027050">I will hear no more of this, demon!</string>
  <string id="6027051">Anders is right.</string>
  <string id="6027053">Ah, right. Fabulous powers, yours if you deliver me the dreamer. Are we agreed?</string>
  <string id="6027108">That's it, Feynriel. Hard on the downstroke, then lift. Good!</string>
  <string id="6027111">I'll have you scribing all my letters soon. If I'd known you were such a bright lad, I'd have brought you into the business years ago.</string>
  <string id="6027114">Does that mean I can come with you to Antiva, Father? Mother said maybe this summer... Right, Mother?</string>
  <string id="6027122">Go to the chantry to find out if the grand cleric was involved in the Qunari disappearance.</string>
  <string id="6027133">You decided to enlist Lilley's gang to protect the Bone Pit from the Coterie. Return to Hubert and give him the news.</string>
  <string id="6027134">Listened to Seldrek's deal, but didn't agree</string>
  <string id="6027135">Turned down the Coterie</string>
  <string id="6027138">Deal made with Seldrek</string>
  <string id="6027140">Sister Emeline</string>
  <string id="6027156">Mine Massacre</string>
  <string id="6027324">Go to Ser Varnell's daytime rally near Darktown to confirm Petrice's suspicions.</string>
  <string id="6027326">Go to the Bone Pit to assess the situation for Hubert.</string>
  <string id="6027327">See to the workers who are sheltered in the mines.</string>
  <string id="6027328">Don't listen, Son. She's always been ashamed of you.</string>
  <string id="6027331">She wanted you gone so she could go back to the Dalish. I'm the one who loves you.</string>
  <string id="6027334">But... why can't I remember you?</string>
  <string id="6027335">This is a trick, Feynriel. He wants something from you.</string>
  <string id="6027336">He doesn't love you.</string>
  <string id="6027337">It's not your father, Feynriel. You're trapped in the Fade by a demon.</string>
  <string id="6027338">It's a demon.</string>
  <string id="6027339">Thank you, Mother!</string>
  <string id="6027342">Oh, Father, won't it be wonderful? Will we be going by land or sea? I've always wanted to see the Hundred Pillars.</string>
  <string id="6027345">We'll see anything you like.</string>
  <string id="6027348">And you're sure your family won't mind that I'm half elf?</string>
  <string id="6027351">They'll love you as much as I do.</string>
  <string id="6027352">If he loves you so much, why didn't he come back for you before?</string>
  <string id="6027353">He doesn't love you.</string>
  <string id="6027354">Why...? That's right! I spent my whole childhood waiting for you.</string>
  <string id="6027357">Your mother never allowed—</string>
  <string id="6027360">My mother loves me! She showed me the letters she wrote you. You never wrote back.</string>
  <string id="6027363">And it was Mother who taught me to write, not you! I've never met you before! Who are you?</string>
  <string id="6027366">That's not your father, Feynriel. It's a demon. And I'm definitely not your mother.</string>
  <string id="6027367">Snap out of it!</string>
  <string id="6027368">A demon? No! No, I want this.</string>
  <string id="6027371">Then remember this is who took away the... </string>
  <string id="6027374">...only thing you ever wanted!</string>
  <string id="6027375">I know how long you've wanted a father.</string>
  <string id="6027376">I'm happy for you.</string>
  <string id="6027377">Yes. My whole life...</string>
  <string id="6027380">Where have you been my whole life? Why do I feel like I love you, but I know I've never met you before?</string>
  <string id="6027383">That's ridiculous. Your mother and I had our differences, but I always loved you.</string>
  <string id="6027386">No! You're making me think things... What are you?</string>
  <string id="6027389">Don't... question...</string>
  <string id="6027392">...me!</string>
  <string id="6027395">Aaah!</string>
  <string id="6027398">You! You turned him against me.</string>
  <string id="6027443">Bethany, I beg you! Don't go! Don't do this!</string>
  <string id="6027446">I'll be fine, Mother, I promise. This will work out for the best, you'll see.</string>
  <string id="6027452">Are you sure about this, big brother? I hope you're not just trying to protect me.</string>
  <string id="6027453">We'll be fine without you. Stay in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6027454">I don't need you.</string>
  <string id="6027455">We can't both go into the Deep Roads. It's too dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6027456">Mother's right.</string>
  <string id="6027457">Trust me, this is no picnic. I'd stay if I could.</string>
  <string id="6027458">You don't want to go.</string>
  <string id="6027459">Fair enough. I hope you're right.</string>
  <string id="6027468">Carver, I beg you! Don't go! Don't do this!</string>
  <string id="6027471">Don't worry about me so. I can take care of myself, you'll see.</string>
  <string id="6027474">Oh, thank the Maker!</string>
  <string id="6027477">What? Now you're just being daft. You need me down there!</string>
  <string id="6027484">So I get left behind to mind the chickens? I see how it is.</string>
  <string id="6027490">Personal drama over with? Then let's get underway.</string>
  <string id="6027499">So are you ready? It's a long trek. If you have any business you need to wrap up here, you'd better do it now.</string>
  <string id="6027500">I'm ready. Let's get started.</string>
  <string id="6027501">Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6027505">We've chosen one of the hidden entrances. The Deep Roads there will be nice and virginal, ready for a good deflowering.</string>
  <string id="6027508">Now, before we... wait. Who invited the old woman?</string>
  <string id="6027511">I'm sorry to interrupt, ser dwarf, but I need to speak with my children.</string>
  <string id="6027514">I just want to know one thing: are you planning on taking Bethany with you?</string>
  <string id="6027517">Mother... I'll be fine. I want to go.</string>
  <string id="6027520">I just want to know one thing: are you planning on taking Carver with you?</string>
  <string id="6027523">I'm going. It'll be fine.</string>
  <string id="6027526">It's not fine! You can't both go! What if something were to happen to you?</string>
  <string id="6027529">Well, you're not going to be able to take everyone, anyhow. You'll need to decide.</string>
  <string id="6027532">I need some time.</string>
  <string id="6027533">I'm not ready.</string>
  <string id="6027534">Then I'll make sure we have all the supplies we need. Don't take all year.</string>
  <string id="6027540">Still looking for our Deep Roads entrance. Any progress, partner?</string>
  <string id="6027541">Found your mystical horde of coin yet, human?</string>
  <string id="6027542">I do have your coin, in fact.</string>
  <string id="6027543">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6027544">Now we just need a decent entrance into the Deep Roads.</string>
  <string id="6027545">These might be just what we need.</string>
  <string id="6027546">I have maps.</string>
  <string id="6027550">Varric mentioned it. We have an idea.</string>
  <string id="6027551">We're looking into that.</string>
  <string id="6027552">Aren't there plenty of entrances into the Deep Roads out there?</string>
  <string id="6027553">You don't know of one?</string>
  <string id="6027554">None that haven't already been explored. I've no interest in trying to pluck a bare duck.</string>
  <string id="6027557">If you can find a way in, then we can leave sooner. Until then, I have to keep looking.</string>
  <string id="6027560">You'll get your coin.</string>
  <string id="6027561">Not yet.</string>
  <string id="6027562">Then how about you tell me when that happens? Until then, you're not much of a partner.</string>
  <string id="6027571">Varric! Where did you get off to? And what are you planning?</string>
  <string id="6027574">Bartrand! So suspicious! I have, in fact, brought us our future partner!</string>
  <string id="6027583">You again? What now?</string>
  <string id="6027586">I spoke to Varric about becoming a partner.</string>
  <string id="6027589">Look, if we're going to be partners...</string>
  <string id="6027592">Now is that any way to talk to your business partner?</string>
  <string id="6027595">Partner? Bloody Varric.</string>
  <string id="6027598">If you see that sodding bastard, bring him here. I want to hear exactly what he's promised, right from his lying mouth.</string>
  <string id="6027604">You're not coming with us, and that's final!</string>
  <string id="6027607">Return to Hubert in Hightown's market by day.</string>
  <string id="6027610">Control of the Bone Pit was handed to the miners to settle a labor dispute.</string>
  <string id="6027611">Control of the Bone Pit was wrested from Hubert to settle a labor dispute.</string>
  <string id="6027619">There's been a collapse—the way forward is blocked.</string>
  <string id="6027622">What? Is there some way around?</string>
  <string id="6027625">Not that I've been able to find. The side passages are too dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6027628">Useless! What am I paying you blighters for?</string>
  <string id="6027631">Screams</string>
  <string id="6027634">Set camp!</string>
  <string id="6027638">You rejected Lilley's offer of protecting the the Bone Pit from the Coterie. Return to Hubert and give him the news.</string>
  <string id="6027654">Leave now and I will not pursue you.</string>
  <string id="6027655">I don't want to fight.</string>
  <string id="6027656">You can't honestly believe that will happen.</string>
  <string id="6027659">Complete accident. I was trying to help. Honest.</string>
  <string id="6027660">Oops.</string>
  <string id="6027661">And now you're going to die.</string>
  <string id="6027662">You're a monster!</string>
  <string id="6027663">Take away my pets, and I'll take away yours. How loyal are these friends you drag into the Fade?</string>
  <string id="6027666">Would your pirate queen stay if the open water beckoned?</string>
  <string id="6027669">What do you say, sweetheart? A two-mast brigantine, square-main topsail...  A hundred well-built lads to answer your every whim.</string>
  <string id="6027672">Ooh.</string>
  <string id="6027673">This is a demon, Isabela. Don't let it tempt you.</string>
  <string id="6027674">Don't fall for it.</string>
  <string id="6027675">Well, if it wasn't a demon, I wouldn't think it could grant wishes!</string>
  <string id="6027678">Should I turn around now to let you stab me in the back? Or would you rather it be a surprise?</string>
  <string id="6027679">I can't beat that.</string>
  <string id="6027680">You are just the sweetest!</string>
  <string id="6027683">Think about siding with that demon, and you're dead.</string>
  <string id="6027684">Don't turn on me.</string>
  <string id="6027685">You'll have to catch me first.</string>
  <string id="6027688">The Siren's Call Two awaits in Kirkwall Harbor. I'll be under the furs in the captain's quarters.</string>
  <string id="6027691">I like big boats, I cannot lie.</string>
  <string id="6027692">You have cost me a dreamer, but at least you will provide me a death!</string>
  <string id="6027693">What would your noble knight do to reclaim what she lost?</string>
  <string id="6027696">You spent your whole life trying to be the chevalier your father wanted. The one thing you chose for yourself, and the darkspawn took him.</string>
  <string id="6027699">Wesley?</string>
  <string id="6027702">I've been waiting for you, love. All your doubts started when we met this apostate.</string>
  <string id="6027705">Come back to me, love. Everything went wrong when we met this family of apostates.</string>
  <string id="6027708">Kill him, and everything we lost will be restored.</string>
  <string id="6027709">Kill her, and everything we lost will be restored.</string>
  <string id="6027710">This isn't Wesley, Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6027711">Don't trust him.</string>
  <string id="6027712">The Fade is the only place where your failure can be erased.</string>
  <string id="6027715">This is a demon in Wesley's skin. How can you fall for this?</string>
  <string id="6027716">You believe this?</string>
  <string id="6027717">It is not the form she wants. It is redemption.</string>
  <string id="6027720">You make one move, I'll take your bloody head off.</string>
  <string id="6027721">Don't turn on me.</string>
  <string id="6027722">Is that how a friend would speak to you?</string>
  <string id="6027725">I failed you, Wesley. I failed myself. If that moment could be changed...</string>
  <string id="6027728">Ha! You want me, come through her!</string>
  <string id="6027743">Problems, Brother?</string>
  <string id="6027746">Sodding Deep Roads! Who knows how long it'll take to clear the path?</string>
  <string id="6027749">Shall we not try to find a way around, instead? Seems like the logical choice.</string>
  <string id="6027752">You think I'm an idiot, Varric? The scouts say the side passages are too dangerous!</string>
  <string id="6027753">I'll deal with whatever we find if it means not sitting here.</string>
  <string id="6027754">I can handle danger.</string>
  <string id="6027755">We need to do something. Sitting out here in the open is just as dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6027756">Don't give up now.</string>
  <string id="6027757">See? This is why you bring someone like me along.</string>
  <string id="6027758">Good thing I'm no scout.</string>
  <string id="6027759">We'll take a look. If we come running back, screaming, you'll know staying put was the right decision.</string>
  <string id="6027762">Fine, fine! Find a way around. Just do it quickly!</string>
  <string id="6027768">Er... I hate to add to your burdens, my friends, but I fear I must.</string>
  <string id="6027771">I fear my boy, Sandal, wandered off. He's somewhere in those passages, right now!</string>
  <string id="6027774">I beg you, keep an eye out for him. He just... doesn't understand danger like he should.</string>
  <string id="6027775">If he's alive, we'll find him.</string>
  <string id="6027776">We'll look for him.</string>
  <string id="6027777">We need to search the side passages. We'll bring him back, if we can.</string>
  <string id="6027778">We'll look for him.</string>
  <string id="6027779">We'll bring him back in one piece. Or maybe two. Hard to say, really.</string>
  <string id="6027780">We'll look for him.</string>
  <string id="6027781">Poor Sandal. I can't believe he's done this!</string>
  <string id="6027784">You knew the risk when you brought him here.</string>
  <string id="6027785">He's on his own.</string>
  <string id="6027786">We have to think of the expedition first. I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6027787">He's on his own.</string>
  <string id="6027788">Don't worry, I'm sure he's fine! What could happen?</string>
  <string id="6027789">He's on his own.</string>
  <string id="6027790">Then I need to find him myself!</string>
  <string id="6027796">Wonderful. Let's find a way around before the entire expedition runs off one by one.</string>
  <string id="6027806">Like any beast, remove the fangs and it is lost.</string>
  <string id="6027826">Bodahn better start keeping that boy on a short leash.</string>
  <string id="6027827">Sighs At least you found Bodahn.</string>
  <string id="6027828">And now Bodahn's disappeared, too. Great! Anyone else you'd like to drive off into the Deep Roads?</string>
  <string id="6027829">Find Bodahn's boy, if you can. I have to get these blighters digging.</string>
  <string id="6027832">My people, I present to you... our hope.</string>
  <string id="6027838">His features may mark him as human, but in his heart beats the blood of the Dales!</string>
  <string id="6027841">He came to us to learn his heritage, to release the power from a lineage as ancient as our race.</string>
  <string id="6027844">He is now a prisoner of the Circle, but through us, he shall find freedom!</string>
  <string id="6027850">I... I don't know what to say...</string>
  <string id="6027861">This is a trick.</string>
  <string id="6027862">Say no.</string>
  <string id="6027863">That's not the Keeper, Feynriel. Demons can take on other forms.</string>
  <string id="6027864">She's a demon.</string>
  <string id="6027865">Your power could restore the elves to their former glory.</string>
  <string id="6027866">This is your birthright.</string>
  <string id="6027868">The Wounded Coast Cave</string>
  <string id="6027869">The Cave on the Wounded Coast</string>
  <string id="6027930">The viscount is relieved that the matter is closed, but the Arishok and Mother Petrice may have more to add.</string>
  <string id="6027940">First Enchanter? You're not going to tell me my magic makes me dangerous?</string>
  <string id="6027946">He is First Enchanter, child, but also an elf.</string>
  <string id="6027952">You have a gift we feared lost. As a dreamer, you can tap the power of the Fade and the spirits within, as we all once did.</string>
  <string id="6027961">You will change the course of history, Feynriel.</string>
  <string id="6027962">Embrace it.</string>
  <string id="6027963">N-no, all my nightmares do is wake me up screaming. What power is that?</string>
  <string id="6027966">A dreamer's mind shapes the Fade. Open yourself to the spirits, and you can bring that control to the mortal realm.</string>
  <string id="6027969">Spirits? You mean demons!</string>
  <string id="6027972">This is what the Circle warns of... the temptation.</string>
  <string id="6027975">Weren't you... Keeper Marethari warned me of this!</string>
  <string id="6027978">You're not the Keeper! Mother's people have no Circle, but they don't consort with demons.</string>
  <string id="6027981">You! Why did you interfere?</string>
  <string id="6027984">With my power joined to his, Feynriel would have changed the world!</string>
  <string id="6028138">You found him! I can't believe it, you found him!</string>
  <string id="6028141">Hello!</string>
  <string id="6028144">I owe you a great debt. I will repay it somehow—I swear my life on it!</string>
  <string id="6028156">Help me! Aaah!</string>
  <string id="6028162">I am such a fool! How could running off like that have helped the boy?</string>
  <string id="6028163">You should have known better.</string>
  <string id="6028164">No argument here.</string>
  <string id="6028165">You were only thinking of your son's safety.</string>
  <string id="6028166">It's understandable.</string>
  <string id="6028167">Brave, but not all that smart.</string>
  <string id="6028168">This isn't helping.</string>
  <string id="6028169">Thank you. If... if you find Sandal out there, I pray you do the same for him.</string>
  <string id="6028181">I do hope nothing has happened to the boy. The thought that he's out there, wandering...</string>

  <string id="6028511">I think that's all of them.</string>
  <string id="6028514">For the moment.</string>
  <string id="6028517">Yes. You're right.</string>
  <string id="6028520">We should have run sooner! Why did we wait so long?</string>
  <string id="6028523">Why are you looking at us? We've been running since Ostagar!</string>
  <string id="6028524">Why are you looking at me? I've been running since Ostagar!</string>
  <string id="6028525">Are you two insane? If we stand around, we'll die!</string>
  <string id="6028526">Enough!</string>
  <string id="6028527">Listen, you two. The darkspawn could be on us any minute.</string>
  <string id="6028528">We need to get out of here.</string>
  <string id="6028529">Not to interrupt, but the Blight's not going to wait while we stand here pointing fingers.</string>
  <string id="6028530">Speaking of running...</string>
  <string id="6028531">Please! Listen to your brother.</string>
  <string id="6028534">Please! Listen to your sister.</string>
  <string id="6028537">Then let's go. Lead on.</string>
  <string id="6028797">Wait! Where are we going?</string>
  <string id="6028800">Away from the darkspawn. Where else?</string>
  <string id="6028803">And then where? We can't just wander aimlessly!</string>
  <string id="6028804">We stay alive. That's the only thing we need to worry about right now.</string>
  <string id="6028805">First things first.</string>
  <string id="6028806">Wherever we go, what's important is that we don't separate.</string>
  <string id="6028807">We have to stay together.</string>
  <string id="6028808">So long as we wander aimlessly away from the horde, I'm happy.</string>
  <string id="6028809">Why not?</string>
  <string id="6028810">We can go to Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6028813">What? Why would we go there?</string>
  <string id="6028816">I know that, but we still have family there—and an estate.</string>
  <string id="6028819">Sighs Then we need to get to Gwaren and take ship.</string>
  <string id="6028822">If we survive that long. I'll just be happy to get out of here.</string>
  <string id="6028837">Mother told me the Dalish are honorable! Why would the Keeper lie?</string>
  <string id="6028840">Why would she entrust her people to a human?</string>
  <string id="6028843">You are one of us, Feynriel. Your magic will restore our greatness.</string>
  <string id="6028846">But I-I can't even control my magic. The Circle says I have power, but no gift for using it.</string>
  <string id="6028847">But... you told me this magic was outlawed for a reason. Even the Dalish don't practice it anymore.</string>
  <string id="6028848">That's a demon, Feynriel. It wants to trick you.</string>
  <string id="6028849">That's not the Keeper.</string>
  <string id="6028850">Could the elves trust you with the power to shape reality?</string>
  <string id="6028851">It is too dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6028852">I—</string>
  <string id="6028855">Could you trust yourself?</string>
  <string id="6028859">He lies! The first enchanter is a pawn of the templars.</string>
  <string id="6028865">No! Silence, demon!</string>
  <string id="6028872">Don't listen to him! The first enchanter is trying to keep you from realizing your greatness.</string>
  <string id="6028875">Trying to keep me from temptation... from demons! What are you?</string>
  <string id="6028878">Trying to keep me from temptation, just like you were. You're not the Keeper!</string>

  <string id="6028933">Can you... do that?</string>
  <string id="6028936">I am the greatest of my kind! Whatever tricks your little pet has taught you will pale in comparison.</string>

  <string id="6028938">Don't trust it, Merrill.</string>

  <string id="6029006">Interesting...</string>
  <string id="6029019">Cast your eyes elsewhere, demon. I won my freedom from the magisters long ago.</string>
  <string id="6029022">But you fear them still. They have left their marks on your body and your mind.</string>
  <string id="6029025">With my aid, you could be free forever. You could have power enough to challenge any who would chain you.</string>
  <string id="6029026">If you accept, you are no better than the magistrates.</string>
  <string id="6029027">Don't listen, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6029028">But... to face them as an equal? I...</string>
  <string id="6029031">How transparent can you get?</string>
  <string id="6029032">That's heavy-handed.</string>
  <string id="6029036">Turn on me, Fenris, and you'll regret it.</string>
  <string id="6029037">Don't you dare.</string>
  <string id="6029038">And thus you resort to threats? I have faced far worse than you.</string>
  <string id="6029041">What... would you want from me?</string>
  <string id="6029044">A moment of your time, nothing more.</string>
  <string id="6029045">You think this dwarf would turn down an opportunity to seize a power unknown to his kind?</string>

  <string id="6029051">A hero? Bartrand betrayed us!</string>
  <string id="6029054">And came away with the treasure of the ages.</string>
  <string id="6029057">With my aid, you would have emerged with the glory, not tarnished silver and flesh wounds.</string>

  <string id="6030421">You must master your power.</string>

  <string id="6030425">You're right. I must master it, find someone to study under.</string>
  <string id="6030428">You are free of these nightmares. Where will you go now?</string>
  <string id="6030429">What will you do?</string>
  <string id="6030432">Perhaps Tevinter. If these powers can be trained, it would be there.</string>
  <string id="6030435">This is a world of monsters. And they all want me! Please, help me escape. Help me die!</string>
  <string id="6030436">If I kill you here, I only destroy your mind. You will become a Tranquil.</string>
  <string id="6030437">You won't die.</string>
  <string id="6030438">I was afraid of that for so long. I can't even remember why.</string>
  <string id="6030441">To live, to sleep without dreaming, to never hear a demon's whisper—it is a blessing as great as standing at the Maker's side.</string>
  <string id="6030444">Do it! Put the knife in my heart.</string>

  <string id="6030459">I must go see him at the Circle. He must forgive me now.</string>
  <string id="6030462">He will walk a strange path as a dreamer, Arianni. Do not expect your son's life to be easy now.</string>
  <string id="6030463">Keeper Marethari, may I return with you to the Sunderlands? I would like to ask my son's forgiveness.</string>
  <string id="6030466">Of course. It was you who chose to stay away.</string>
  <string id="6030467">He must go elsewhere to train. There is no one in Kirkwall to help him. He asked me to say goodbye.</string>
  <string id="6030468">Feynriel is leaving.</string>
  <string id="6030469">My son! No! I must find him before he goes.</string>
  <string id="6030472">It is wise for him to seek guidance. Kirkwall cannot provide what he needs.</string>
  <string id="6030475">The boy is safe, and there was talk of a reward.</string>
  <string id="6030476">I need my payment.</string>
  <string id="6030477">This book belonged to the last dreamer of our tribe. It has a rare magic beyond price.</string>
  <string id="6030480">Please accept it with my gratitude.</string>
  <string id="6030488">Oh, my boy! What did you do to him?</string>
  <string id="6030491">It was Feynriel's choice to not live with temptation.</string>
  <string id="6030492">I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6030493">I saw the demons' powers—I could not risk Feynriel falling to them.</string>
  <string id="6030494">I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6030495">There's a reason the Chantry kills dreamers.</string>
  <string id="6030496">He was a menace.</string>
  <string id="6030497">No! I must go to him. Maybe it's not too late!</string>

  <string id="6030618">You're joking.</string>
  <string id="6030621">What did I tell you, Bartrand? Not bad for a human.</string>
  <string id="6030624">All right, partner. Full share of the profit between you, me, and Varric.</string>
  <string id="6030627">What's this? Three... four entrances into the Deep Roads, all in the Free Marches? Where did you get these?</string>
  <string id="6030630">A wizard did it.</string>
  <string id="6030633">Didn't I tell you we could find a Grey Warden? Mother didn't raise a fool. Well... she didn't raise two of them.</string>
  <string id="6030636">From a former Grey Warden, actually.</string>
  <string id="6030639">Well, color me astounded! We just pick the most promising one and go!</string>
  <string id="6030642">Varric has a lot of ideas.</string>
  <string id="6030645">I will get the coin, I promise.</string>
  <string id="6030646">Not yet.</string>
  <string id="6030647">I'm still figuring that part out.</string>
  <string id="6030648">Not yet.</string>
  <string id="6030649">Relax, Bartrand! Have I ever let you down?</string>
  <string id="6030652">You don't want me to answer that.</string>
  <string id="6030658">You!</string>
  <string id="6030661">Ah, brotherly love. It's quite something, don't you think?</string>
  <string id="6030664">Sure is something, especially when little brother makes promises I can't keep.</string>
  <string id="6030667">What? Partner! You stupid, nug-humping dirt-farmer! Why did you go promising something like that?</string>
  <string id="6030670">Because if we don't get this expedition moving, Brother, then we won't have any profits to argue about, will we?</string>
  <string id="6030673">Hmph. Maybe you have a point.</string>
  <string id="6030674">Glad you're finally seeing some sense.</string>
  <string id="6030675">It's about time.</string>
  <string id="6030676">I'd prefer to see some coin. That all in Varric's head, or do you have any?</string>
  <string id="6030677">So we're partners?</string>
  <string id="6030678">Then you agree?</string>
  <string id="6030679">That depends. You got the coin we need?</string>
  <string id="6030680">There's so much love here. It's very comforting.</string>
  <string id="6030681">I feel so welcome.</string>
  <string id="6030682">What I'd love is the coin to back up my brother's confidence. How about it, human?</string>
  <string id="6030683">I suppose you're the help he promised? It figures.</string>
  <string id="6030686">Just bring Varric here, already.</string>

  <string id="6031118">Big risks, big rewards.</string>
  <string id="6031119">I didn't give up all that coin for nothing.</string>
  <string id="6031120">There better be.</string>
  <string id="6031121">Trust me. You will reap what you sow, partner.</string>
  <string id="6031124">We shouldn't be taking any needless risks.</string>
  <string id="6031125">Let's not be reckless.</string>
  <string id="6031126">This isn't a foolish endeavor. This will work!</string>
  <string id="6031129">Risks, rewards—what could be better?</string>
  <string id="6031130">Sounds like fun.</string>
  <string id="6031131">Exactly!</string>
  <string id="6031134">Mother? I told you not to get involved with this!</string>
  <string id="6031137">I hadn't decided yet.</string>
  <string id="6031138">I don't know.</string>
  <string id="6031139">I can't leave Bethany behind. I need her.</string>
  <string id="6031140">Yes, of course.</string>
  <string id="6031141">I don't really need her along.</string>
  <string id="6031142">I doubt it.</string>
  <string id="6031143">No! I can't stay here. Without you, the templars will surely find me.</string>
  <string id="6031146">Bethany, please! The Deep Roads are so dangerous! I couldn't bear it if something happened...</string>
  <string id="6031149">Mother, no. We talked about how important this is.</string>
  <string id="6031152">I hadn't decided yet.</string>
  <string id="6031153">I don't know.</string>
  <string id="6031154">I can't leave Carver behind. I need him.</string>
  <string id="6031155">Yes, of course.</string>
  <string id="6031156">You I understand wanting to do this. But leave your sister here, I beg you!</string>
  <string id="6031159">It's the templars or the darkspawn, Mother. At least I'm allowed to fight darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6031162">You I understand wanting to do this. But leave your brother here, I beg you!</string>
  <string id="6031165">I said I'm going. Besides, if we're so bloody afraid of templars, I should go and he should hide!</string>
  <string id="6031168">I don't really need him along.</string>
  <string id="6031169">I doubt it.</string>
  <string id="6031170">After a year in hiding, you think you can storm the roads yourself? Oh, you need me.</string>

  <string id="6031247">Saemus was lured to the chantry. Go there at night to check on him.</string>
  <string id="6031259">Salutations!</string>
  <string id="6031260">Ah! So you are the new partner? A pleasure to meet you!</string>
  <string id="6031263">Bodahn Feddic, purveyor of goods both common and rare, at your service!</string>
  <string id="6031266">And this is my son, Sandal, who is as brilliant an enchanter as you'll ever find! Say hello to the nice human, Sandal.</string>
  <string id="6031269">Hello.</string>
  <string id="6031272">We shall be accompanying your expedition and providing the needed supplies. It's all quite exciting, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6031273">You aren't worried about venturing into such a dangerous place?</string>
  <string id="6031274">Dangerous, too.</string>
  <string id="6031275">Not with such fine protection!</string>
  <string id="6031278">We'll face both darkspawn and the unknown.</string>
  <string id="6031279">This isn't a pleasure trip.</string>
  <string id="6031280">Indeed! And who knows what shall await us at the end?</string>
  <string id="6031283">The thought of adventure does make me giddy.</string>
  <string id="6031284">I'm all a-tremble.</string>
  <string id="6031285">Laughs A kindred soul, surely!</string>
  <string id="6031288">But I digress. Do you wish to peruse my wares? Or perhaps make use of Sandal's unique talents?</string>
  <string id="6031291">Enchantment?</string>
  <string id="6031294">Just so.</string>
  <string id="6031295">I thought all enchanters were mages?</string>
  <string id="6031296">Your son is an enchanter?</string>
  <string id="6031297">Not at all! The fabled dwarven resistance to magic has allowed enchantment of crafts for countless ages!</string>
  <string id="6031300">Granted, most dwarven smiths must work for many, many years to learn the skill—but my boy is a natural! A savant beyond compare!</string>
  <string id="6031303">I like enchantment.</string>
  <string id="6031306">And he enjoys his work! What more could one ask?</string>
  <string id="6031307">You two don't seem the sort to hire onto this sort of expedition.</string>
  <string id="6031308">How did you end up here?</string>
  <string id="6031309">My son and I have never played it safe, never kept to the tried and true roads.</string>
  <string id="6031312">In fact, we have just returned from adventures while accompanying the Hero of Ferelden—legendary Grey Warden and vanquisher of the Blight!</string>
  <string id="6031313">So you helped to defeat the Blight?</string>
  <string id="6031314">You knew the Hero of Ferelden?</string>
  <string id="6031315">In our small way, perhaps. We did not fight at the Grey Warden's side, of course!</string>
  <string id="6031321">Pity how the hero met his end. For such a man to die as he slew the great Archdemon... a tragic—if heroic—tale!</string>
  <string id="6031324">Pity how the hero met her end. For such a woman to die as she slew the great Archdemon... a tragic—if heroic—tale!</string>
  <string id="6031330">I hear that the hero is married to the king, now. Fancy that! A Grey Warden queen!</string>
  <string id="6031336">I hear that the hero is married to the queen, now. Fancy that! A Grey Warden ruling Ferelden!</string>
  <string id="6031342">The Hero of Ferelden is a fine man. After all his accomplishments, may he find even greater success.</string>
  <string id="6031348">The Hero of Ferelden is a fine woman. After all her accomplishments, may she find even greater success.</string>
  <string id="6031351">Ah, but surely my past is hardly of interest to the likes of you!</string>
  <string id="6031352">Let's see what you have.</string>
  <string id="6031353">I wish to buy something.</string>
  <string id="6031354">By all means, feel free to peruse my wares whenever you wish.</string>
  <string id="6031357">Let's see what your son can do.</string>
  <string id="6031358">Enchanting.</string>
  <string id="6031359">Enchantment!</string>
  <string id="6031362">I don't need anything right now.</string>
  <string id="6031363">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="6031364">I look forward to our voyage together!</string>
  <string id="6031369">What do you need, my good friend?</string>
  <string id="6031375">Umm...</string>
  <string id="6031378">Don't mind him, messere. Sandal's never been one for conversation.</string>
  <string id="6031384">Are you sure about this, sis? I hope you're not just trying to protect me.</string>
  <string id="6031388">Carver, your brother's only doing what he thinks is best...</string>
  <string id="6031391">Carver, your sister's only doing what she thinks is best...</string>
  <string id="6031394">I know. I guess I'll have to do the same.</string>
  <string id="6031397">Been a long time coming, eh, Brother?</string>
  <string id="6031400">That it has. The Deep Roads await!</string>
  <string id="6031631">Master Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6031644">Lilley</string>
  <string id="6031650">Take heart, mistress. Your boy was strong to the end. He did not fall to the demons' temptations; he was tricked.</string>
  <string id="6031651">Anders is right. If I had not succumbed to the demon, Feynriel might yet be free.</string>
  <string id="6031652">I am the one who was weak.</string>
  <string id="6031653">I don't understand. Succumbed? Are you saying... that you sold my son to a demon? You monster!</string>
  <string id="6031656">Peace, Arianni. Even the best souls can fall prey to demonic temptations. Now is the time to mourn, not seek vengeance.</string>
  <string id="6031659">Come with me to warn the Circle. Let us put your son to rest.</string>
  <string id="6031660">Come with me to warn the tribe. Together we can lay Feynriel to rest.</string>
  <string id="6031661">No one needs to hear your account of it.</string>
  <string id="6031662">Quiet, Anders!</string>
  <string id="6031663">Would you kill me again to ensure my silence? I will not forget this.</string>
  <string id="6031693">Get on with it then, or we're not going to get very far, are we?</string>
  <string id="6031696">I truly did not think what you did was possible. You are a rare human, indeed.</string>
  <string id="6031699">I'm sorry. I should have stood beside you. I don't expect that will be enough, but there it is.</string>
  <string id="6031702">You have my apologies. It is easy to forget that one cannot bind demons with words.</string>
  <string id="6031705">And I must apologize for my weakness. I would have thought myself above such influence.</string>
  <string id="6031708">I don't know what came over me. I thought I was immune to silver-tongued promises.</string>
  <string id="6031711">Does this mean I'm not getting my ship? Bugger it all!</string>
  <string id="6031714">Your friend awakened here some time ago. No one is immune to a demon's offer. </string>
  <string id="6031717">You made the right choice with Feynriel.</string>
  <string id="6031720">You accomplished a miracle with Feynriel.</string>
  <string id="6031730">Wesley's Ring</string>
  <string id="6031743">Mistress Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6031746">I thought perhaps you would be willing to show mages a kindness once more.</string>
  <string id="6031747">Do I know you?</string>
  <string id="6031748">Who are you again?</string>
  <string id="6031749">Can I get the details before I agree?</string>
  <string id="6031750">What's this about?</string>
  <string id="6031751">You didn't need to call me all the way out here just to pay me for my silence...</string>
  <string id="6031752">You want to pay me in person?</string>
  <string id="6031812">Why would a templar help him?</string>
  <string id="6031813">A templar?</string>
  <string id="6031816">Does this Samson have a residence in Kirkwall?</string>
  <string id="6031817">Where is he?</string>
  <string id="6031821">No. He's a wanted man.</string>
  <string id="6031827">Slow down. Tell me what happened here.</string>
  <string id="6031830">Where'd the dragons come from?</string>
  <string id="6031831">How did this happen?</string>
  <string id="6031832">We was mining a new tunnel when the wall collapsed, and dragons came through! It was a bloody slaughter!</string>
  <string id="6031839">Did anyone else manage to escape?</string>
  <string id="6031840">Any other survivors?</string>
  <string id="6031841">Some of my fellows ran for the surface. I hope they made it.</string>
  <string id="6031852">Answers first. What happened here?</string>
  <string id="6031855">Hold on. What happened here?</string>
  <string id="6031874">Magical Barrier</string>
  <string id="6031964">I am Ser Thrask of the templars.</string>
  <string id="6031967">Have you already forgotten the man that you are still blackmailing over his poor daughter's death?</string>
  <string id="6031976">I know from the compassion with which you treated Feynriel that you are someone who cares for the fate of apostate mages.</string>
  <string id="6031977">What, you can't be nice yourself?</string>
  <string id="6031978">Can't you be kind?</string>
  <string id="6031979">You are no templar. You cannot know what a badge of shame that would be.</string>
  <string id="6031982">Do not goad me, serah! Believe me, I thought long and hard before entrusting you with this, but I did not know where else to go.</string>
  <string id="6031985">If you drag me down here, you'd better have something worth my time.</string>
  <string id="6031986">This request come with coin?</string>
  <string id="6031987">I will pay. Have no worries on that front.</string>
  <string id="6031990">There are a number of apostates hiding in those caverns.</string>
  <string id="6031993">I was hoping you might speak to the group, convince them to surrender peacefully before my fellow templars arrive.</string>
  <string id="6031994">Who are these apostates? Where did they come from?</string>
  <string id="6031995">How did the mages get here?</string>
  <string id="6031996">Do the other templars intend to do worse than recapture the mages?</string>
  <string id="6031997">What will the templars do?</string>
  <string id="6031998">I would not like to see this become a massacre.</string>
  <string id="6031999">I will help you.</string>
  <string id="6032000">If you've got this many mages escaping, you templars aren't too good at your jobs...</string>
  <string id="6032001">There's a group of apostates?</string>
  <string id="6032002">Catching runaway mages is your job.</string>
  <string id="6032003">Do it yourself.</string>
  <string id="6032007">These mages have shown they attack templars on sight.</string>
  <string id="6032008">And most of them are good.</string>
  <string id="6032011">Shouldn't an expedition like this have already planned that?</string>
  <string id="6032012">Find an entrance?</string>
  <string id="6032013">I said a decent entrance.</string>
  <string id="6032019">I have an idea on that, if you want to talk privately.</string>
  <string id="6032022">Talk to Varric. He seems to know everything he shouldn't. Maybe he'll finally know something he should.</string>
  <string id="6032033">Ser Karras hunts them as well. If they have not surrendered by the time he arrives, this will be a blood bath.</string>
  <string id="6032041">These are the mages of the former Circle at Starkhaven. It burned to the ground and their templars sent for us to relocate the survivors.</string>
  <string id="6032044">Unfortunately, they escaped on the journey. With their phylacteries burned, it has been nearly impossible to track them.</string>
  <string id="6032048">What's a phylactery?</string>
  <string id="6032049">Phylacteries?</string>
  <string id="6032050">When a mage joins the Circle, the first enchanter takes a sample of his blood.</string>
  <string id="6032053"> It is used as a focus to track the mage should he escape.</string>
  <string id="6032057">Ser Karras is a knight-lieutenant of the templars, a great crony of Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6032060">Should he find apostates hiding from pursuit, Meredith will consider him justified in murdering the lot of them.</string>
  <string id="6032061">Who's Meredith?</string>
  <string id="6032062">Meredith?</string>
  <string id="6032063">You have clearly not been in Kirkwall long...</string>
  <string id="6032066">Meredith is knight-commander. She has changed the rules for mages in Kirkwall. They are less free than elsewhere. </string>
  <string id="6032069">Though I daresay she has created as much dissent as obedience.</string>
  <string id="6032070">Thank you. Your compassion does you credit.</string>
  <string id="6032076">They were not our charges. They were en route to Kirkwall from Starkhaven when they escaped.</string>
  <string id="6032084">Gate</string>
  <string id="6032096">Lowtown</string>
  <string id="6032098">Arianni</string>
  <string id="6032127">Maker's blessing! I thought I was going to die down here in this... this tomb!</string>
  <string id="6032130">Are you with the templars? Please, I need to go back to the Circle. I never wanted to get involved in this.</string>
  <string id="6032133">Not when he started making those... those things!</string>
  <string id="6032134">Are you saying the other mages raised the dead?</string>
  <string id="6032135">What about those things?</string>
  <string id="6032136">Tell me, how many are with you? Where are they?</string>
  <string id="6032137">What else am I facing?</string>
  <string id="6032138">The templar Thrask is waiting outside. Surrender to him and you won't be hurt.</string>
  <string id="6032139">I can help you.</string>
  <string id="6032143">Help! Please! Anyone!</string>
  <string id="6032176">Qunari Compound</string>
  <string id="6032192">I beg of you, run to the Bone Pit!</string>
  <string id="6032195">Decimus... it was his decision. He kept saying the templars would label us blood mages if we fled—why not use it if it's our best tool?</string>
  <string id="6032198">He slit his wrist, and the magic... it rose from the blood and woke the skeletons in the cave.</string>
  <string id="6032201">I ran. Decimus is wrong—blood magic is a work of evil, not just a power the templars keep from us for spite!</string>
  <string id="6032202">Someone starts raising undead and it's all downhill from there...</string>
  <string id="6032203">That's how it goes...</string>
  <string id="6032204">Give yourself up to the templars, and tell me where the others are.</string>
  <string id="6032205">Turn yourself in.</string>
  <string id="6032206">They're hiding in the caves. Decimus set wards, protections—he's the one who raised the dead.</string>
  <string id="6032223">Lowtown Bazaar</string>
  <string id="6032255">Hubert</string>
  <string id="6032261">Decimus is the leader of these mages?</string>
  <string id="6032262">Tell me about Decimus.</string>
  <string id="6032263">He's crazy.</string>
  <string id="6032266">He said, with our phylacteries gone, no one could find us. We would be free... I think maybe he set the fire.</string>
  <string id="6032269">There must be a demon working through him. No normal man would profane the dead like this.</string>
  <string id="6032270">There are maybe a dozen of us left. Everyone who survived the Starkhaven fire.</string>
  <string id="6032273">I've been at the Circle since I was six. I've heard about demons, blood magic... they warned us, but I never thought I'd see it.</string>
  <string id="6032279">I surrender! Take me to the templars! I don't want anything to do with this... blood magic.</string>
  <string id="6032285">The rest of them, they're still following Decimus. He's gone mad. I think he'd kill us all just to take the templars down.</string>
  <string id="6032288">Ser Thrask waits outside. You will be safe there.</string>

  <string id="6032604">Kill the demons vying for control of Feynriel.</string>
  <string id="6032610">Worthless, am I? My farm supplied eggplant to half of South Reach.</string>
  <string id="6032613">Yeah? My eggplant supplied half the bastards in South Reach.</string>
  <string id="6032616">Laughs</string>
  <string id="6032824">You're a real hero. Now, what brings you here?</string>
  <string id="6032828">Break's over. You've got jobs to get back to.</string>
  <string id="6032829">Get back to work.</string>
  <string id="6032853">Earl! Eyes on her face, you lush!</string>
  <string id="6032865">Go back to that blight-taken hole? I need work, but I don't need to be some dragon's dinner.</string>
  <string id="6032866">I killed the dragons. It's safe to return to work.</string>
  <string id="6032867">The mine's safe now.</string>
  <string id="6032868">What if there's more dragons later? Or something worse, like uh... bigger dragons!</string>
  <string id="6032876">I go back to the missus without this job, she'll rip me apart sure as any dragon!</string>
  <string id="6032897">Hubert sold me half the mine, so expect some changes.</string>
  <string id="6032898">You work for me now.</string>
  <string id="6032899">Would you go back for twice your previous salary?</string>
  <string id="6032900">How about a raise?</string>
  <string id="6032915">Wow! Well, I...</string>
  <string id="6032918">Andraste's teats, Jansen, take it! We can drown our sorrows every night—and not with this Darktown swill, either.</string>
  <string id="6032924">Back to work, boys. I'm happy to take more of Hubert's coin!</string>
  <string id="6032933">Really? Be nice to work for one of our own. If you don't give us a fair shake, who would?</string>
  <string id="6032936">Tell Hubert not to expect his miner's return. He's in Hightown's market by day.</string>
  <string id="6032937">The Bone Pit miners didn't return to work.</string>
  <string id="6032991">Changed your mind? Interested in my wares?</string>
  <string id="6032992">I was just leaving.</string>
  <string id="6032993">No.</string>
  <string id="6032994">I wish you the Maker's speed in finding Feynriel.</string>
  <string id="6032995">I bring only the best of Rivain and Antiva for sale here.</string>
  <string id="6033096">Ah. So you're the reinforcements the magistrate promised.</string>
  <string id="6033099">The man you're looking for, he's holed up in the ruins. Though I doubt he's still in one piece.</string>
  <string id="6033102">That bastard's to be brought in alive after all he's done? Just because it isn't you and your pretty little shemlen children he's after...</string>
  <string id="6033115">The man you're after, he targets elves! He dragged my daughter into those ruins and killed her! I want him dead!</string>
  <string id="6033118">Thank you, serah. You have no idea what this means.</string>
  <string id="6033122">Why only elves? Why not human children as well?</string>
  <string id="6033123">The fugitive targets elves?</string>
  <string id="6033124">A man who murders children won't survive long in the courts of Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6033125">The courts will punish him.</string>
  <string id="6033126">I'll tear his throat out myself.</string>
  <string id="6033127">The man's a monster.</string>
  <string id="6033128">No! Don't you understand? If you take him in, he'll be free again by nightfall!</string>
  <string id="6033134">For all my damned coin, I'm still only an elf to these shemlen. There'll be no justice for my girl in the courts of Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6033135">What do you say about all this?</string>
  <string id="6033136">What about you men here?</string>
  <string id="6033137">They won't go in after him. They're stalling, trying to give the murdering bastard a chance to get away.</string>
  <string id="6033140">Oy now, elf. Like we said before, you're bleeding mad if you think we'll be going against the magistrate's orders.</string>
  <string id="6033141">There must be some humans who would take offense to these disappearances.</string>
  <string id="6033142">How does this go unnoticed?</string>
  <string id="6033146">We're nothing to them. Even if this murderer does finally go before the courts, the magistrate won't take our word over his.</string>
  <string id="6033150">This murderer cannot be allowed to walk free.</string>
  <string id="6033151">All right, I'll help you.</string>
  <string id="6033152">Then that bastard will finally get what he deserves. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6033155">Not wise, stranger. You try to take justice into your own hands, the magistrate'll have your head.</string>
  <string id="6033161">The magistrates of Kirkwall will pass judgment, not you or me.</string>
  <string id="6033162">No, I can't decide his fate.</string>
  <string id="6033163">No human magistrate is going to side with an elf.</string>
  <string id="6033166">Human laws don't value elven lives, my friend. </string>
  <string id="6033169">You don't understand how things work for us elves. There'll be no justice. You'll see.</string>
  <string id="6033172">The Bone Pit</string>
  <string id="6033181">Bone Pit Ledge</string>
  <string id="6033186">City Guardsman</string>
  <string id="6033190">Understood.</string>
  <string id="6033288">Your friend has been hurt. There are some poultices in our pack you can use.</string>
  <string id="6033291">I'll grab them!</string>
  <string id="6033295">The Deep Roads expedition has begun.</string>
  <string id="6033296">Search the ruined thaig for something of interest to the expedition.</string>
  <string id="6033305">Bone Pit Mines</string>
  <string id="6033307">One man out there, alone? What are his chances?</string>
  <string id="6033308">You think he's still alive?</string>
  <string id="6033309">My boy is sturdier than you think!</string>
  <string id="6033312">If he has one of his enchantments with him, he'll survive. He's burned down the house twice by accident.</string>
  <string id="6033315">I'm more worried about him getting lost. Oh, my poor boy!</string>
  <string id="6033316">When did you last see him?</string>
  <string id="6033317">How did he go missing?</string>
  <string id="6033318">Not a half hour ago. I turned my back to hand out rations, and he was gone!</string>
  <string id="6033321">He gets so easily distracted. Ah, I should have been harsher with my warnings!</string>
  <string id="6033322">Let's move quickly, then.</string>
  <string id="6033376">You'd be alone among the Dalish. Even more than a Dalish would be here.</string>
  <string id="6033377">It'd be a hard life.</string>
  <string id="6033378">Compared to being held prisoner, or made Tranquil? I'll risk being lonely.</string>
  <string id="6033381">You don't whittle down those ears, they're apt to shoot you on sight.</string>
  <string id="6033382">You'd better look the part.</string>
  <string id="6033383">I'd rather be killed by the Dalish than turned Tranquil by templars!</string>
  <string id="6033386">Look, I know it's different in other kingdoms, but here... no one helps Circle mages. Anything the templars don't like, you get the brand.</string>
  <string id="6033389">The Dalish, they've had magic forever. They could teach me. I won't be a danger, I swear.</string>
  <string id="6033392">Elf, human... the only thing that matters is the demons.</string>
  <string id="6033393">You're a mage.</string>
  <string id="6033394">Look, I'm not completely ignorant. I know why they lock mages up. I-I've heard the demons whispering.</string>
  <string id="6033397">But the Dalish, they've been working magic well before humans were in these lands.</string>
  <string id="6033400">Surely the Keeper can train my magic as well as a bunch of templars.</string>
  <string id="6033402">Don't go making promises you can't keep.</string>
  <string id="6033403">I don't believe you.</string>
  <string id="6033404">But I will keep it! You'll see.</string>
  <string id="6033407">No need. I'm glad Sandal was all right.</string>
  <string id="6033408">Glad to help.</string>
  <string id="6033409">Because of you! You will not regret this.</string>
  <string id="6033412">What do you have in mind?</string>
  <string id="6033413">Repay?</string>
  <string id="6033414">I don't know, but I will find a way!</string>
  <string id="6033423">Bone Pit Mines</string>
  <string id="6033431">The magistrate paid double to protect his son's secret.&#13;
&#13;
</string>
  <string id="6033432">Well I'll be a nug's uncle. Isn't that Bodahn's boy?</string>
  <string id="6033477">Hey!</string>
  <string id="6033483">Grunts</string>
  <string id="6033486">Gasps</string>
  <string id="6033492">Off you go.</string>
  <string id="6033495">Gasps</string>
  <string id="6033501">How do you do? Varric Tethras, at your service!</string>
  <string id="6033536">So, here's the thing: we need to find a way into the Deep Roads.</string>
  <string id="6033539">Bartrand can lead us to the right place once we're down there, but we need a good entrance.</string>
  <string id="6033540">How do you plan an expedition into the Deep Roads without knowing a way in?</string>
  <string id="6033541">Isn't that kind of important?</string>
  <string id="6033542">I've fought darkspawn, but I've never been to the Deep Roads.</string>
  <string id="6033543">How do we do that?</string>
  <string id="6033544">Any entrance would do, wouldn't it? Unless a dragon's sitting in it, I suppose.</string>
  <string id="6033545">Do we have a bad entrance?</string>
  <string id="6033546">We need an entrance that's close to our destination but isn't already plundered or filled with darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6033549">Fortunately, I've received some new information.</string>
  <string id="6033552">There's a Grey Warden in the city. If anyone knows how to get down there, it'll be him.</string>
  <string id="6033553">Why would a Grey Warden know that?</string>
  <string id="6033554">How can you be so sure?</string>
  <string id="6033555">The Wardens don't just fight darkspawn; they forge into the Deep Roads all the time.</string>
  <string id="6033558">And if he doesn't know, he might be able to point us to those who do.</string>
  <string id="6033559">Are there any other options?</string>
  <string id="6033560">And if he knows nothing?</string>
  <string id="6033561">None at the moment. Bartrand had an entrance lined up, but it was a bust.</string>
  <string id="6033564">I'll keep looking, but if we don't find something, we'll have a fancy expedition with nowhere to go.</string>
  <string id="6033565">We may need to wring it out of him. Wardens can be secretive.</string>
  <string id="6033566">If we can make him talk.</string>
  <string id="6033567">We don't want trouble with the Grey Wardens, do we?</string>
  <string id="6033568">Wardens are dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6033569">Let's look at our options, first. I'd rather not fight a Warden unless we have to.</string>
  <string id="6033572">Sounds like you have it all planned out, Varric.</string>
  <string id="6033573">Problem solved!</string>
  <string id="6033574">And that, messere, is why I'm here.</string>
  <string id="6033577">Supposedly, this Grey Warden came in with some other Fereldan refugees not long ago.</string>
  <string id="6033580">A Lowtown woman named Lirene has been helping the Fereldans. We talk to her, maybe we learn where he is.</string>
  <string id="6033586">Now, onto other matters: I think I have something that might interest you.</string>
  <string id="6033589">I have a guy that can get us some work with the thieves' guild.</string>
  <string id="6033590">How much do you know about them?</string>
  <string id="6033591">The thieves' guild?</string>
  <string id="6033592">I'm not a member, if that's what you're asking. But I know some of their people.</string>
  <string id="6033595">The Coterie is the strongest guild in Kirkwall. If you care to bed anyone, they'd be the ones to court.</string>
  <string id="6033596">Point me to him. I need all the work I can get.</string>
  <string id="6033597">Sounds good.</string>
  <string id="6033598">This just reeks of trouble.</string>
  <string id="6033599">I don't know...</string>
  <string id="6033600">And coin. They go hand in hand, you know.</string>
  <string id="6033603">Gallard's in Darktown. Probably worth knowing what he has in mind, even if you're not interested.</string>
  <string id="6033606">I'll keep after my contacts—see if I can drum up any other work.</string>
  <string id="6033618">I apologize for Bartrand. He wouldn't know an opportunity if it hit him square in the jaw.</string>
  <string id="6033621">But you would?</string>
  <string id="6033624">I would! What my brother doesn't realize is that we need someone like you.</string>
  <string id="6033627">He would never admit it, either—he's too proud. I, however, am quite practical.</string>
  <string id="6033628">You're part of Bartrand's venture?</string>
  <string id="6033629">Are you in the expedition?</string>
  <string id="6033630">That's right! The Deep Roads wouldn't normally be my thing, but I can't allow the head of our family to go down there alone.</string>
  <string id="6033633">So as you might imagine, I have more than a passing interest in this expedition's success.</string>
  <string id="6033634">What makes you so certain we can help? You know nothing about us.</string>
  <string id="6033635">You know who we are?</string>
  <string id="6033636">On the contrary—you've made quite the name for yourself over the last year.</string>
  <string id="6033639">Serving with the Red Iron is no mean feat; yet you not only served, you impressed!</string>
  <string id="6033642">The Coterie has been squeezing smugglers out left and right, and the only group to survive owes it all to you two.</string>
  <string id="6033645">The name Hawke is on many lips these days. Not bad for a Fereldan fresh off the boat!</string>
  <string id="6033646">He said he didn't need another guard.</string>
  <string id="6033647">Your brother refused me.</string>
  <string id="6033648">There must be some way to persuade your brother to hire us on.</string>
  <string id="6033649">How do we reason with him?</string>
  <string id="6033650">You're going awfully far out of your way just to hire another guard.</string>
  <string id="6033651">You're a little too smooth.</string>
  <string id="6033652">We don't need another hireling—we need a partner!</string>
  <string id="6033655">The truth is, Bartrand's been tearing his beard out trying to fund this on his own, but he can't do it.</string>
  <string id="6033658">Invest in the expedition. A hundred sovereigns, and he can't refuse. Not with me there to vouch for you.</string>
  <string id="6033659">Your brother doesn't seem like the sort who's willing to split profits.</string>
  <string id="6033660">He'll share the profits?</string>
  <string id="6033661">My brother is many things, but he's not stupid.</string>
  <string id="6033664">Far better to share the profits than be trapped in a thaig with a thousand darkspawn between you and the exit.</string>
  <string id="6033667">Trust me. He'll come around.</string>
  <string id="6033668">Why would you stick your neck out for a complete stranger?</string>
  <string id="6033669">You'd vouch for me?</string>
  <string id="6033673">I'd rather take a chance on someone with your reputation than head into the Deep Roads unprepared.</string>
  <string id="6033676">And besides, we'd be your partners. I'm willing to give a little trust if you are.</string>
  <string id="6033677">If I had coin to invest, I wouldn't need this job in the first place.</string>
  <string id="6033678">This is pointless.</string>
  <string id="6033679">It sounds interesting—but if I had any gold, I wouldn't need this job.</string>
  <string id="6033680">I don't have much coin.</string>
  <string id="6033681">I hope there's more to this. Like how I'm supposed to get that much coin together.</string>
  <string id="6033682">That's your big plan?</string>
  <string id="6033683">You need to think big! There's only a brief window after a Blight when the Deep Roads won't be crawling with darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6033686">The treasure you find down there could set you and your family up for life!</string>
  <string id="6033689">We work together, you and I, and before you know it, you'll have all the capital you need. What do you say?</string>
  <string id="6033690">There might be nothing down there except darkspawn and rubble. How can you be sure we'll make a profit?</string>
  <string id="6033691">This seems like a long shot.</string>
  <string id="6033692">Bartrand isn't grasping at strings. He's operating on some good information.</string>
  <string id="6033695">Some of the Deep Roads are so old, even the dwarves have forgotten them.</string>
  <string id="6033698">We just need to get down there, then Bartrand will lead the way. You and I will be there to handle problems.</string>
  <string id="6033699">What's to stop you from taking my investment and running?</string>
  <string id="6033700">I'm supposed to trust you?</string>
  <string id="6033701">You'll be traveling with the expedition. And I'll be at your side.</string>
  <string id="6033704">If I cross you, you'll be the first one to know. And I'll be the last.</string>
  <string id="6033705">What makes you so certain you'll be useful to me?</string>
  <string id="6033706">So how could you help me?</string>
  <string id="6033707">I know everyone in this city worth knowing.</string>
  <string id="6033710">I can help you find the jobs you need, and if you don't need me for that...</string>
  <string id="6033713">...there's always Bianca.</string>
  <string id="6033714">You named your crossbow?</string>
  <string id="6033715">Bianca?</string>
  <string id="6033716">And why not? She's a beauty. Isn't that right, sweetheart?</string>
  <string id="6033717">If this is a trick, you'll pay for it, dwarf.</string>
  <string id="6033718">You'd better not be lying.</string>
  <string id="6033719">Wonderful! I'll take that as a yes!</string>
  <string id="6033722">You have a deal.</string>
  <string id="6033723">I'll do it.</string>
  <string id="6033724">It's not like I had anything better planned.</string>
  <string id="6033725">Why not?</string>
  <string id="6033726">Perfect!</string>
  <string id="6033729">We should talk privately when you get the chance. In the Hanged Man, maybe—I'll be there when I'm not with you.</string>
  <string id="6033732">Now, let's go see what trouble we can stir up.</string>
  <string id="6033753">He survived this entire time?</string>
  <string id="6033756">It is! The great warrior stands victorious!</string>
  <string id="6033759">Talk about dumb luck.</string>
  <string id="6033762">Unbelievable.</string>
  <string id="6033765">If he isn't, he's an incredibly close copy.</string>
  <string id="6033768">I don't see a weapon. Did he stun them with his wit?</string>
  <string id="6033771">How did he do that?</string>
  <string id="6033792">Is this what you were expecting?</string>
  <string id="6033795">Old scavenger tales. After the Third Blight. A week below the surface, they said, but nobody believed them...</string>
  <string id="6033798">Looks like they were right.</string>
  <string id="6033807">Kill the demons vying for control of Feynriel, and give Feynriel to Torpor.</string>
  <string id="6033808">Return to Feynriel.</string>
  <string id="6033809">Kill Torpor.</string>
  <string id="6033811">Feynriel has been made Tranquil to suppress his powers.</string>
  <string id="6033812">Feynriel is now free of demons and has gone to Tevinter to seek training in his powers.</string>
  <string id="6033813">Feynriel was possessed by the demon Torpor, making him one of the most powerful abominations the world has ever seen.</string>
  <string id="6033815">The door!</string>
  <string id="6033824">Scared out of my wits, I ran like my ass was on fire—it probably was. Only I went the wrong way. Ended up trapped here.</string>
  <string id="6033953">What do I care what shield they carry? If they challenge us, the dead themselves will meet the call!</string>
  <string id="6033962">That was almost too easy.</string>
  <string id="6033965">Wait. I recognize that lout.</string>
  <string id="6033968">Who is he?</string>
  <string id="6033971">He's in the Coterie. One of that damned fool Brekker's men.</string>
  <string id="6033979">I don't get it. Nothing in this thaig makes sense.</string>
  <string id="6033982">Why's that?</string>
  <string id="6033985">We're well below the Deep Roads. Whatever dwarves lived here, they came long before the First Blight.</string>
  <string id="6033988">But where are the statues of Paragons? I don't recognize these markings on the wall or anything in the rubble.</string>
  <string id="6033989">You can't know everything about dwarven history.</string>
  <string id="6033990">You're no historian.</string>
  <string id="6033991">Who knows how old these ruins are? Maybe your people were different back then.</string>
  <string id="6033992">Haven't dwarves changed?</string>
  <string id="6033993">I know enough about our history to know we haven't changed much. Dwarves have been mired in tradition for many ages.</string>
  <string id="6033996">Whatever's here must be very rare and valuable.</string>
  <string id="6033997">That means it's valuable!</string>
  <string id="6033998">Hmm. Possibly.</string>
  <string id="6034001">These dwarves might have been unique. If so, I hope they kept their valuables close at hand.</string>
  <string id="6034013">Vimmark Mountain Pass</string>
  <string id="6034019">You killed him! Oh, Decimus, you should have listened to me, love...</string>
  <string id="6034022">I saw what you are! How could you murder one of your own just for daring to defy the templars?</string>
  <string id="6034023">You think he brought those skeletons to life to serve me tea?</string>
  <string id="6034024">He attacked me.</string>
  <string id="6034025">I do not need to be part of the Circle to know blood magic is unnatural.</string>
  <string id="6034026">I am no blood mage.</string>
  <string id="6034027">I do not answer to the Circle—or to you.</string>
  <string id="6034028">My reasons are my own!</string>
  <string id="6034029">That's all we ask for. To answer only to ourselves.</string>
  <string id="6034032">You... you are one of us, but you wear no mark of the Circle. How is it you side against your own?</string>
  <string id="6034035">Maybe your lover should have tried hello. We're friendlier than you think.</string>
  <string id="6034038">That man was a blood mage. I don't have to be part of the Circle to know that is wrong.</string>
  <string id="6034041">Do you not see the pointy ears and tattoos? I'm Dalish. You are not my own.</string>
  <string id="6034044">Decimus gave us the courage to face the templars. Without him, we would be prisoners still.</string>
  <string id="6034045">The only mage in Starkhaven who was willing to stand up to those Kirkwall bullies, and you murdered him!</string>
  <string id="6034046">He obviously meant a lot to you.</string>
  <string id="6034047">I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6034048">He was our future! Until he came, we never thought to fight back.</string>
  <string id="6034051">I told Decimus he was going too far, but he said it was the only way to protect us. To protect me.</string>
  <string id="6034055">If he taught you any of that blood magic, you could have him up and walking in no time.</string>
  <string id="6034056">So raise him from the dead.</string>
  <string id="6034057">The minute he resorted to blood magic, he signed his execution warrant.</string>
  <string id="6034058">He was a blood mage.</string>
  <string id="6034059">I warned him. I told him, once he marked himself as a blood mage, that was all anyone would see.</string>
  <string id="6034062">Please... we only want our freedom. Without your help, the templars will execute us all for Decimus's crimes.</string>
  <string id="6034066">If not in the Circle, how do you intend to live?</string>
  <string id="6034067">Where do you want to go?</string>
  <string id="6034068">I hear there are places, outside the Free Marches, where the templars are not so vigilant.</string>
  <string id="6034072">I would never turn a fellow mage over to the templars.</string>
  <string id="6034073">Of course I'll help.</string>
  <string id="6034074">What do you ask of me?</string>
  <string id="6034075">Help you how?</string>
  <string id="6034076">Why not? It's not like I'll be joining the templars any time soon.</string>
  <string id="6034077">Templars hate me anyway...</string>
  <string id="6034078">I don't have enough people trying to kill me, might as well add all the templars in Kirkwall...</string>
  <string id="6034079">Sure, I'll help. Why not?</string>
  <string id="6034080">You followed him. You should all face punishment.</string>
  <string id="6034081">The crimes are also yours.</string>
  <string id="6034082">If you try to turn us in, do not think your own talents will go unremarked.</string>
  <string id="6034083">If you try to turn us in, your friends are coming with us. </string>
  <string id="6034084">If you try to turn us in, your friend is coming with us.</string>
  <string id="6034085">Does the Circle's punishment fit the crime? Does wanting our freedom justify them gelding our minds?</string>
  <string id="6034111">Qunari Meeting</string>
  <string id="6034112">Qunari Meeting</string>
  <string id="6034152">We're too late for your boys, but we'll make the rotters pay.</string>
  <string id="6034177">Then we must first throw off pursuit.</string>
  <string id="6034180">There is a templar who followed us. You must have met him when you entered.</string>
  <string id="6034183">Kill him, and we can get clear of Kirkwall before the templars send more men.</string>
  <string id="6034192">Do not doubt that the templars will let an extra apostate share our punishment.</string>
  <string id="6034195">Threatening to turn me in really doesn't help your all mages stick together image.</string>
  <string id="6034198">She shows her true colors.</string>
  <string id="6034201">This is risky. Thrask said other templars were coming.</string>
  <string id="6034209">I beg you, kill the templar who pursues us. </string>
  <string id="6034212">Better the death of one templar than so many innocents.</string>
  <string id="6034215">I would not see these mages killed, but if we start murdering templars, we'll draw their fury down on us.</string>
  <string id="6034218">We should help them. We don't know what this good-hearted templar truly intends to do.</string>
  <string id="6034221">These are blood mages, not like you or Bethany. And what do you think happens if we start killing templars?</string>
  <string id="6034224">Yes, let's murder a templar. Surely that will help.</string>
  <string id="6034227">They would have us kill a man for doing the just work of a templar?</string>
  <string id="6034230">Will you buy us time to flee Kirkwall?</string>
  <string id="6034231">Thrask is a good man. It is no more right for him to die than you.</string>
  <string id="6034232">I won't help you.</string>
  <string id="6034233">Oh, just a little murder? Is that it? Uh, no.</string>
  <string id="6034234">I won't help you.</string>
  <string id="6034235">I am bringing you back to the Circle, willing or no.</string>
  <string id="6034236">I won't help you.</string>
  <string id="6034237">Consider it done.</string>
  <string id="6034238">I will kill Thrask.</string>
  <string id="6034239">I will do what I can to help, but not at the cost of Thrask's life.</string>
  <string id="6034240">Murder is going too far.</string>
  <string id="6034266">What can we do? That bastard Hubert is the only one willing to hire us.</string>
  <string id="6034270">Enough.</string>
  <string id="6034276">You have proven your mettle. I would not see these creatures harmed without need.</string>
  <string id="6034277">We're defending ourselves. Keep your distance.</string>
  <string id="6034278">They attacked us first.</string>
  <string id="6034279">You're the first one here that hasn't simply attacked us.</string>
  <string id="6034280">You're willing to talk?</string>
  <string id="6034281">I'd say being attacked on sight gives us plenty of need!</string>
  <string id="6034282">Define without need.</string>
  <string id="6034283">They will not assault you further, not without my permission.</string>
  <string id="6034286">What are these things? They seem like rock wraiths, but...</string>
  <string id="6034289">They hunger.</string>
  <string id="6034292">The profane have lingered in this place for ages beyond memory, feeding on the magic stones until the need is all they know.</string>
  <string id="6034295">They eat the lyrium.</string>
  <string id="6034298">The lyrium? That's what sustains them?</string>
  <string id="6034301">They eat the lyrium? Sounds like a healthy diet.</string>
  <string id="6034304">I am not as they are. I am... a visitor.</string>
  <string id="6034305">You're a demon, feeding on their hunger. I can sense it.</string>
  <string id="6034306">You're no visitor.</string>
  <string id="6034307">I would not see my feast end.</string>
  <string id="6034311">Merrill?</string>
  <string id="6034312">It is a hunger demon, drawn here by their need.</string>
  <string id="6034316">Anders?</string>
  <string id="6034317">It seems mostly interested in their hunger. It's a demon, come to feed.</string>
  <string id="6034321">Bethany?</string>
  <string id="6034322">I'm not sure. I... think it's some kind of demon, feeding on their hunger.</string>
  <string id="6034325">How are you different?</string>
  <string id="6034326">You look like one of them.</string>
  <string id="6034327">They seem to obey your commands.</string>
  <string id="6034328">Are you their ruler?</string>
  <string id="6034329">Their will is weak, and mine is strong.</string>
  <string id="6034332">We're visitors as well, but I doubt we're from the same place.</string>
  <string id="6034333">So are we.</string>
  <string id="6034334">I am of the Fade, lured by their hunger. It is a feast that sustains me well, and I would not see it end.</string>
  <string id="6034337">I sense your desire. You seek to leave this place, but you will need my aid to do so.</string>
  <string id="6034340">There's nothing to be afraid of. You can use it, if you're careful.</string>
  <string id="6034343">Don't do it. Demons will trip you up every time.</string>
  <string id="6034346">Be careful! I don't like the sound of this.</string>
  <string id="6034349">Could be a way out of here, I don't know...</string>
  <string id="6034352">What are our options?</string>
  <string id="6034353">This something you can handle?</string>
  <string id="6034354">Merrill, kill it.</string>
  <string id="6034355">I'll give it my answer!</string>
  <string id="6034356">We kill it.</string>
  <string id="6034357">Let's do it.</string>
  <string id="6034358">We deal.</string>
  <string id="6034359">We don't have much choice.</string>
  <string id="6034360">We deal.</string>
  <string id="6034361">What have we got to lose?</string>
  <string id="6034362">We deal.</string>
  <string id="6034363">We kill them all and find our own way out.</string>
  <string id="6034364">We refuse.</string>
  <string id="6034365">We're not dealing with a demon.</string>
  <string id="6034366">We refuse.</string>
  <string id="6034367">I'm not becoming that thing's next meal.</string>
  <string id="6034368">We refuse.</string>
  <string id="6034370">Then lay down your arms. I am trying to save our lives, not throw them away. We will come with you.</string>
  <string id="6034374">Thank you. I am glad that one of our own was the first to find us.</string>
  <string id="6034375">Thank you. It is rare to find someone who counts so many mages among their friends.</string>
  <string id="6034376">You have surprised me. I did not think, after what you did to Decimus, that you would support us. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6034377">If you will not kill him, then you must convince him you killed us. That is our only hope.</string>
  <string id="6034380">But I spent two weeks traveling with these templars. They strike first and think after. They are far easier to kill than to fool.</string>
  <string id="6034386">We will speak no more. I would not wish any templars to overhear we still survive.</string>
  <string id="6034387">Go quickly. Slay the templar before his fellows arrive.</string>
  <string id="6034388">I am coming peacefully. What more do you want?</string>
  <string id="6034399">Screams</string>
  <string id="6034402">Foolish!</string>
  <string id="6034405">Very wise.</string>
  <string id="6034408">There is a crypt not far from here guarded by a creature that has confounded me for too long.</string>
  <string id="6034411">Slay it... and freedom is yours.</string>
  <string id="6034414">Most unwise.</string>
  <string id="6034428">Are you saying there isn't anyone inside? Then where did that apprentice come from?</string>
  <string id="6034431">Eh, finally someone comes to help me. You look a bit unseasoned, but I hope you will do!</string>
  <string id="6034432">You said some of your workers are Fereldan?</string>
  <string id="6034433">You hire Fereldans?</string>
  <string id="6034436">Slaver</string>
  <string id="6034465">Screams</string>
  <string id="6034471">Now I have the power of the dreamer! The Fade shall move at my command.</string>
  <string id="6034474">Return to your mortal realm. Your reward awaits you.</string>
  <string id="6034480">I can do this.</string>
  <string id="6034495">Chanter's Board</string>
  <string id="6034506">I followed the tracks from the caravan site, but the boy says the others already left.</string>
  <string id="6034509">Don't lie, Thrask. I know you're soft on the robes. I followed the same tracks and—</string>
  <string id="6034515">What do we have here?</string>
  <string id="6034516">The blood mage is dead. These mages willingly return to the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6034517">These mages surrendered.</string>
  <string id="6034518">Would you believe... a group of innocent picnickers?</string>
  <string id="6034519">We're no one special.</string>
  <string id="6034520">Who is this, Thrask? Now you require mercenaries to carry out your duties?</string>
  <string id="6034526">He returned the mage Feynriel to the Circle. I thought he might recover these mages peacefully.</string>
  <string id="6034529">She brought the mage Feynriel back to the Circle. I hoped she would return these mages peacefully.</string>
  <string id="6034532">I was hoping to avoid bloodshed by sending a neutral party to negotiate.</string>
  <string id="6034535">Well, much obliged.</string>
  <string id="6034538">Now let's take these demon-worshippers to the chopping block. Knight-Commander wants them executed before Orsino hears about it.</string>
  <string id="6034541">Take this refuse back to the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6034542">Here are your blood mages.</string>
  <string id="6034543">The Circle? As if we would let these demon-worshippers pollute the minds of our mages.</string>
  <string id="6034546">No. Once they've tasted freedom, apostates are good for nothing. Better to silence them now.</string>
  <string id="6034549">No! And you wonder why we fear them? Please! You must protect us!</string>
  <string id="6034618">Way ahead of you.</string>
  <string id="6034624">Bianca says, The treasure is ours.</string>
  <string id="6034627">The rock wraiths are supposed to be dwarven legends. They're not even supposed to be real!</string>
  <string id="6034630">It's not very real now.</string>
  <string id="6034636">Looked pretty real to me.</string>
  <string id="6034639">I suppose it doesn't matter. Look at what it was guarding!</string>
  <string id="6034642">Whistles</string>
  <string id="6034645">That is not yours.</string>
  <string id="6034648">The key you require is in the chest. Leave all else, for it is mine.</string>
  <string id="6034651">Not to point out the obvious, but can you imagine what this stuff would be worth on the surface?</string>
  <string id="6034654">You will not! It is mine, all of it! Take only the key, or I shall destroy you!</string>
  <string id="6034655">We just killed the guardian. What do you think we'll do to you?</string>
  <string id="6034656">Back off, demon!</string>
  <string id="6034657">You mind?</string>
  <string id="6034658">Varric?</string>
  <string id="6034659">Not if we destroy you first!</string>
  <string id="6034660">Attack!</string>
  <string id="6034661">No need for a fight. We only want to get out of here, nothing more.</string>
  <string id="6034662">Fine, we'll take the key.</string>
  <string id="6034663">I don't care for your threats!</string>
  <string id="6034664">Back off, demon!</string>
  <string id="6034668">That was bracing. Now I suppose we'll need to find our own way out of here.</string>
  <string id="6034671">Bartrand is far more enthralled with this place than you are.</string>
  <string id="6034672">You don't seem excited.</string>
  <string id="6034673">Unlike him, I wasn't born in Orzammar. I wouldn't even be down here if there wasn't profit in it.</string>
  <string id="6034676">This entire place gives me the chills. Let's hope it's worth it.</string>
  <string id="6034677">It better be.</string>
  <string id="6034678">I doubt it.</string>
  <string id="6034679">If we don't find something useful, this entire expedition has been for nothing.</string>
  <string id="6034680">We'd better.</string>
  <string id="6034681">Whatever we find, it might not be very pleasant.</string>
  <string id="6034682">Let's be careful.</string>
  <string id="6034683">Chances are we won't find anything but even more darkspawn. And rubble. Maybe bones?</string>
  <string id="6034684">More darkspawn?</string>
  <string id="6034685">Hmph. I suppose we'll need to go down there to find out?</string>
  <string id="6034687">They deserve a trial.</string>
  <string id="6034688">You can't just kill them!</string>
  <string id="6034689">They're mages. They ran. Done.</string>
  <string id="6034692">I think maybe we all need to take a deep breath. Start over. Grace, this is Thrask. Thrask...</string>
  <string id="6034693">Let's all calm down.</string>
  <string id="6034694">Do what you must.</string>
  <string id="6034695">The mages are yours.</string>
  <string id="6034699">The Circle is a sanctuary, not a prison! If you kill these people, I will see you disciplined by the Divine herself!</string>
  <string id="6034702">Knight-Commander says no rebel robes get to preach to the tame ones.</string>
  <string id="6034708">Are you truly going to send us off with this monster?</string>
  <string id="6034709">The Circle is still safer than life on the run. Thrask will make sure no one hurts you.</string>
  <string id="6034710">You must go with him.</string>
  <string id="6034711">Monster or not, he's a better bet than a demon.</string>
  <string id="6034712">You must go with him.</string>
  <string id="6034713">Mages belong in the Circle. That's the law.</string>
  <string id="6034714">You must go with him.</string>
  <string id="6034715">I'm not going to fight every templar in Kirkwall for you.</string>
  <string id="6034716">You must go with him.</string>
  <string id="6034717">Then we truly have no hope.</string>
  <string id="6034720">You seem a decent man, templar. I must place the lives of all these people in your hands.</string>
  <string id="6034723">Don't count on him being around long enough to help you, Sunshine.</string>
  <string id="6034726">I will do all I can. I swear you this.</string>
  <string id="6034729">Step back, templar. These mages will not go tamely under your blade!</string>
  <string id="6034730">You are free.</string>
  <string id="6034731">We'll discuss your choice of allies later, Thrask. Men...?</string>
  <string id="6034740">You were tracking a dozen apostates, and you bring me one pitiful apprentice and call the job done?</string>
  <string id="6034743">The boy turned himself in.</string>
  <string id="6034746">Those aren't the ones we need templars to track!</string>
  <string id="6034749">I've had my eye on you, Thrask. Don't think I haven't noticed how soft you are on these robes. Hold him for questioning, men.</string>
  <string id="6034755">Run, Master Hawke! They will show you no mercy!</string>
  <string id="6034756">Run, Mistress Hawke! They will show you no mercy!</string>
  <string id="6034771">The Bone Pit</string>
  <string id="6034795">The sooner the better. Each day the mine is not running costs me more than those miners make in a year.</string>
  <string id="6034796">Yes, all of them. An unruly lot, to be sure.</string>
  <string id="6034806">By the grace of the Maker, they're dead! I wanted this to end peacefully, not—</string>
  <string id="6034812">There can be no peace between the mages and templars of Kirkwall, ser. It has gone too far.</string>
  <string id="6034813">You did not aid your fellow templars. Does that mean you're leaving the order?</string>
  <string id="6034814">What will you do now, Thrask?</string>
  <string id="6034815">I had hoped to end this peacefully.</string>
  <string id="6034816">I'm sorry, Ser Thrask.</string>
  <string id="6034817">Your people should leave. Others will come looking for them soon.</string>
  <string id="6034818">Get out of here, Grace.</string>
  <string id="6034819">Why are you still here, Ser? Why did you not fight alongside your fellows?</string>
  <string id="6034822">I... I would not join my name to the likes of Karras. But I cannot support blood magic either.</string>
  <string id="6034825">Sighs I suppose my side has been picked. I will tell the other templars you killed Karras and I came upon the bodies. I will give a false trail to follow.</string>
  <string id="6034831">Thank you. And thank you. Please accept this as the only reward I can offer—I dare not carry a staff with the mark of Starkhaven on it now.</string>
  <string id="6034837">This has been more than I expected. We must away.</string>
  <string id="6034870">The Circle is the safest place for mages. Thank you for convincing those apostates to come peacefully.</string>
  <string id="6034871">Grace and her mages will not have an easy time finding peace on the run.</string>
  <string id="6034872">I have told the families of the mages you killed. May the Maker have mercy on their souls.</string>
  <string id="6034908">Are you trying to tell me this boy is all that's left of the apostates?</string>
  <string id="6034911">I ran away when they began to use blood magic, ser.</string>
  <string id="6034914">They are not in the caverns, Ser Karras. I have thoroughly explored—</string>
  <string id="6034917">Who is this?</string>
  <string id="6034918">I'm the one who's going to get you a medal for putting down this mage rebellion.</string>
  <string id="6034919">I'm your best friend.</string>
  <string id="6034920">Tell him who we are.</string>
  <string id="6034921">Varric, this is your thing.</string>
  <string id="6034922">I was helping Ser Thrask. The apostates are all dead.</string>
  <string id="6034923">I killed the mages.</string>
  <string id="6034924">Dead? But I asked...</string>
  <string id="6034927">You've always been soft on the robes, Thrask. Makes me wonder if these demon-worshippers haven't gotten their fingers into your mind.</string>
  <string id="6034928">I'm here to keep you from locking up innocent mages!</string>
  <string id="6034929">I'm a friend of the mages.</string>
  <string id="6034930">Kill the men. Keep the pretty one for questioning.</string>
  <string id="6034931">Kill them. We'll search these caves ourselves.</string>
  <string id="6034932">Ser Thrask asked me to bring the mages in peacefully.</string>
  <string id="6034933">I'm a friend of Thrask's.</string>
  <string id="6034934">Oh, did he?</string>
  <string id="6034937">I've had my eye on you, Thrask. This isn't the first time you've granted quarter to robes.</string>
  <string id="6034940">Kill the traitor. And his friends. We'll find these demon-worshippers ourselves!</string>
  <string id="6034980">We lost the Warden? That's not right!</string>
  <string id="6034984">Aveline is down? Maker's breath!</string>
  <string id="6034988">Sister? Bethany!</string>
  <string id="6034992">Your pet elf has fallen!</string>
  <string id="6034996">We would lose the fun one. Get her up!</string>
  <string id="6035000">The elf girl is too soft, she's down!</string>
  <string id="6035004">The dwarf has dropped a few more feet!</string>
  <string id="6035008">You're not leaving me like this! Come on!</string>
  <string id="6035012">No, you don't get to be a hero on my watch!</string>
  <string id="6035016">Don't you die on me, not after all this!</string>
  <string id="6035020">That moody mage is down!</string>
  <string id="6035024">Your sister just hit the ground!</string>
  <string id="6035028">Your brother just hit the ground!</string>
  <string id="6035032">The marked one has fallen!</string>
  <string id="6035036">Isabela's on the ground! Appropriately.</string>
  <string id="6035040">The little one is on the ground!</string>
  <string id="6035044">Varric! No time to lay around, you old con!</string>
  <string id="6035048">Hawke is down. Not good!</string>
  <string id="6035052">You're not making your death my fault. Not today!</string>
  <string id="6035056">Not today, Hawke! Not while I'm here!</string>
  <string id="6035126">No!</string>
  <string id="6035129">Yes, you are. Was any of that true?</string>
  <string id="6035132">Parts of it, certainly.</string>
  <string id="6035135">But why was the Champion fighting the Qunari leader? Was this during the attack?</string>
  <string id="6035138">Did you want to hear the whole story or not?</string>
  <string id="6035141">Sighs</string>
  <string id="6035144">Excellent choice.</string>
  <string id="6035145">I thought the point was to learn about the Champion?</string>
  <string id="6035148">Not every single thing! How much longer is your tale?</string>
  <string id="6035151">You wish me to skip ahead?</string>
  <string id="6035154">Yes. Tell me how he became the Champion.</string>
  <string id="6035157">Yes. Tell me how she became the Champion.</string>
  <string id="6035160">As you wish.</string>
  <string id="6035169">A key? The kind that opens doors, I hope.</string>
  <string id="6035178">Then take what you must and leave.</string>
  <string id="6035184">Not bad. Now let's find that key.</string>
  <string id="6035185">Fool!</string>
  <string id="6035188">You lie! I sense your desires! You cannot take what is mine!</string>
  <string id="6035189">And I no longer care for your presence!</string>
  <string id="6035193">Let's see if there's something that can help get us out of here.</string>
  <string id="6035203">How long to get back?</string>
  <string id="6035206">If we're unlucky, maybe a week.</string>
  <string id="6035209">And if we're lucky?</string>
  <string id="6035212">We stumble over Bartrand's corpse on the way.</string>
  <string id="6035215">Laughs</string>
  <string id="6035224">No good. Looks like he's blocked it somehow. We're sealed in.</string>
  <string id="6035274">You get one chance. Did you kill her?</string>
  <string id="6035278">Lilley didn't die by my hand. Someone else did this.</string>
  <string id="6035279">She was dead when I got here.</string>
  <string id="6035280">Lilley died as she lived—in the gutter.</string>
  <string id="6035281">She deserved to die. So do you.</string>
  <string id="6035284">Stop and think about it. We're being played.</string>
  <string id="6035285">Everyone calm down.</string>
  <string id="6035286">Coterie Lieutenant</string>
  <string id="6035288">I'm astonished Ser Thrask didn't mention that Ser Hawke, knight-lieutenant of the Order in Ferelden, was here at the knight-commander's personal invitation.</string>
  <string id="6035291">What's the trouble, Ser Thrask? Did the knight-commander forget to tell Ser Karras that Enchanter Hawke came from Ferelden to help her root out rebel mages.</string>
  <string id="6035295">The apostates resorted to blood magic and ended up turning on each other.</string>
  <string id="6035296">They killed each other.</string>
  <string id="6035297">One of the cowards ran out the back. You should go after him.</string>
  <string id="6035298">Their leader escaped.</string>
  <string id="6035299">Right.</string>
  <string id="6035302">When the apostates resorted to blood magic, I destroyed them all.</string>
  <string id="6035303">I killed them.</string>
  <string id="6035304">Their leader fled the battlefield ahead of us. Bloody coward left his own people to die.</string>
  <string id="6035307">I caught only a glimpse, but it looked like the back passages led out to the coast. I sent your men that way.</string>
  <string id="6035310">The coast, you say? Men, fan out, search the shore. We will retrieve these corpses later.</string>
  <string id="6035316">I will commend you to the knight-commander, Ser Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6035317">I will commend you to the knight-commander, Enchanter Hawke. It is rare to see a mage cooperate with authorities.</string>
  <string id="6035318">The knight-commander will hear of the service you did us.</string>
  <string id="6035321">I'm listening...</string>
  <string id="6035324">Those freaks were using blood magic, but I took care of them. Their leader ran. He was heading for the coast last I saw him.</string>
  <string id="6035357">Leave it to me. By the time I'm done, these templars will swear that the sky is green.</string>
  <string id="6035358">I'll convince him you're dead.</string>
  <string id="6035359">Your confidence almost makes me believe you...</string>
  <string id="6035363">Can't say I didn't give you a chance.</string>
  <string id="6035366">Men, search the caverns. And keep these interlopers under guard until we see what's in there.</string>
  <string id="6035367">You're wasting time better spent tracking any escaped apostates.</string>
  <string id="6035368">Don't go in there.</string>
  <string id="6035369">Seems like you've got something to hide...</string>
  <string id="6035372">Show these fools what happens when you interfere with a templar's investigation.</string>
  <string id="6035373">Tell your men to stand down.</string>
  <string id="6035374">Back off!</string>
  <string id="6035382">Thank you, my friend.</string>
  <string id="6035845">I didn't think you could do it. Truly you must be able to charm a miser out of his last coin.</string>
  <string id="6035848">I did not think any of us would leave those caverns alive.</string>
  <string id="6035849">It won't be an easy path, trying to live free as a mage.</string>
  <string id="6035850">Where will you go?</string>
  <string id="6035851">But it will be my path.</string>
  <string id="6035854">If it makes you feel better, officially you were killed during escape.</string>
  <string id="6035855">Technically you're dead.</string>
  <string id="6035856">I will do my best to seem cold and rotted, then.</string>
  <string id="6035859">The templars could return at any time.</string>
  <string id="6035860">Go quickly.</string>
  <string id="6035861">Please, accept my staff as a reward. It has the mark of Starkhaven on it—I dare not carry it now.</string>
  <string id="6035864">It has served me well.</string>
  <string id="6035867">It should bring a good price.</string>
  <string id="6035870">Now, we must flee as far as we can before nightfall. Thank you, friend.</string>
  <string id="6035898">No one could come so far! You are demons or Ben-Hassrath! We will not die to you!</string>
  <string id="6035904">Still, however despicably you treated me, you were fair and kind to the mage Feynriel. And I had no one else to ask.</string>
  <string id="6035905">It's a pretty sad picture if I'm the one you trust most...</string>
  <string id="6035906">You're short on friends.</string>
  <string id="6035907">At least you have already shown you would rather profit from my secrets than reveal them to the Order.</string>
  <string id="6035913">I'm sorry, Mistress. Your son is gone.</string>
  <string id="6035916">No! These things will not take Carver!</string>
  <string id="6035917">Carver gave himself to save us.</string>
  <string id="6035918">He died bravely.</string>
  <string id="6035919">I don't want a hero! I want my son!</string>
  <string id="6035922">If you fall apart now, you endanger us all.</string>
  <string id="6035923">Pull yourself together!</string>
  <string id="6035924">Don't lecture me! This is your fault!</string>
  <string id="6035927">Maybe we should grieve when we're safe?</string>
  <string id="6035928">This is no time to mourn.</string>
  <string id="6035929">Don't speak to me of grief! This is your fault! </string>
  <string id="6035932">How could you let him charge off like that? Your little brother! My little boy!</string>
  <string id="6035935">Mother, we can't stay here. Carver wouldn't want his sacrifice to be meaningless.</string>
  <string id="6035938">Allow me to commend your son's soul to the Maker, Mistress.</string>
  <string id="6035941">Ashes we were, and ashes we become. Maker, give this young man a place at your side. Let us take comfort in the peace he has found in eternity.</string>
  <string id="6035944">Our lives are more valuable to him than our prayers. Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6035945">That's the best we can give.</string>
  <string id="6035946">I will never forget you, Carver.</string>
  <string id="6035949">Leave him. The darkspawn are gaining by the minute.</string>
  <string id="6035950">We've wasted enough time.</string>
  <string id="6035951">Flames! We're too late.</string>
  <string id="6036229">Varnell?</string>
  <string id="6036235">I hope you will come. This matter only grows more urgent with time.</string>
  <string id="6036249">Give me the money Lebowski.</string>
  <string id="6036250">GIVE ME MONIES!</string>
  <string id="6036251">Goooooold!</string>
  <string id="6036267">Guard</string>
  <string id="6036271">Longshoreman</string>
  <string id="6036290">You'll take care of it, won't you, Brother?</string>
  <string id="6036293">You'll take care of it, won't you, Sis?</string>
  <string id="6036296">I'll make it quick.</string>
  <string id="6036299">And that's what I love about you.</string>
  <string id="6036302">How can I kill my own sister?</string>
  <string id="6036305">Because she's asking you to.</string>
  <string id="6036308">You always were a heartbreaker, Bethany.</string>
  <string id="6036311">And you always made me laugh.</string>
  <string id="6036314">It's just you now. Take care of Mother.</string>
  <string id="6036323">You'll do it, won't you, Brother?</string>
  <string id="6036326">You'll do it, won't you, Sis?</string>
  <string id="6036329">I'll make it quick.</string>
  <string id="6036332">You always were stronger than me.</string>
  <string id="6036335">How can I kill my own brother?</string>
  <string id="6036338">Because he's asking you to.</string>
  <string id="6036341">You always did ask for the world, Carver.</string>
  <string id="6036344">And you always gave it.</string>
  <string id="6036347">It's just you now. Take care of Mother.</string>
  <string id="6036368">Hurlock</string>
  <string id="6036418">I'm not doing anything until I know who I'm working for.</string>
  <string id="6036419">Give me a name or I leave.</string>
  <string id="6036420">If this is criminal, I already have enough trouble.</string>
  <string id="6036421">Is this illegal?</string>
  <string id="6036422">I should think you're about to have more. I am Sister Petrice. This is my burden of charity.</string>
  <string id="6036425">Time is wasting. Who is going where?</string>
  <string id="6036426">Get to the point.</string>
  <string id="6036429">A survivor of infighting with their Tal-Vashoth outcasts. I call him Ketojan, a bridge between worlds.</string>
  <string id="6036438">Finish tasks in Kirkwall while Bartrand makes preparations for the expedition.</string>
  <string id="6036441">Hurlock Bolter</string>
  <string id="6036448">This part of the Deep Roads looks familiar.</string>
  <string id="6036451">We're back where we started, and in only five days. Not bad, eh?</string>
  <string id="6036454">Could we... slow down? I'm not feeling very well.</string>
  <string id="6036455">Let's make camp if you're sick.</string>
  <string id="6036456">We can stop for a bit.</string>
  <string id="6036457">Let's not spend more time down here than we have to.</string>
  <string id="6036458">Keep moving.</string>
  <string id="6036459">I think all our stomachs are a bit tender right now.</string>
  <string id="6036460">You aren't the only one.</string>
  <string id="6036461">I'll wager it was those deep mushrooms we found.</string>
  <string id="6036464">No, I...</string>
  <string id="6036467">Bethany!</string>
  <string id="6036470">Oh, Maker. No.</string>
  <string id="6036473">It's the blight. I can sense it.</string>
  <string id="6036476">It's the blight, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6036479">I'll end up just like Wesley, won't I?</string>
  <string id="6036480">I'm not going to let that happen!</string>
  <string id="6036481">No, you won't.</string>
  <string id="6036482">There must be some other way!</string>
  <string id="6036483">We'll find a way out!</string>
  <string id="6036484">That's just like you, keeping this to yourself.</string>
  <string id="6036485">Why didn't you say something?</string>
  <string id="6036486">What could you have done? Swoop to my rescue?</string>
  <string id="6036489">I'm not going to last until the surface. It's coming on faster.</string>
  <string id="6036492">There might be something we can do.</string>
  <string id="6036495">I stole the maps from a Warden that had come to Kirkwall. I wanted to know if he was looking for me.</string>
  <string id="6036498">He wasn't. The maps were for planning their own expedition into the Deep Roads.</string>
  <string id="6036499">If it could help us, then say so!</string>
  <string id="6036500">So? That does nothing!</string>
  <string id="6036501">Does that mean the Grey Wardens are here?</string>
  <string id="6036502">Does that help us?</string>
  <string id="6036503">Way to keep it to yourself, Anders.</string>
  <string id="6036504">You could have mentioned that.</string>
  <string id="6036505">I was trying to avoid them! And you just wanted the maps!</string>
  <string id="6036508">If the Wardens are here, I know where. We could bring Bethany to them...</string>
  <string id="6036511">And do what? Become a Grey Warden?</string>
  <string id="6036512">If the Wardens are here, I know where. We could bring Carver to them...</string>
  <string id="6036515">And, what? Become a Grey Warden?</string>
  <string id="6036516">Is becoming a Grey Warden a cure?</string>
  <string id="6036517">Would it work?</string>
  <string id="6036518">Yes, I suppose it is.</string>
  <string id="6036521">But it's not without a price— one not everyone is willing to pay.</string>
  <string id="6036522">Let's not waste any time.</string>
  <string id="6036523">We have to try.</string>
  <string id="6036524">If there's even a chance, we must take it.</string>
  <string id="6036525">We have to try.</string>
  <string id="6036526">I don't see any better options.</string>
  <string id="6036527">We have to try.</string>
  <string id="6036528">Then I hope I'm right.</string>
  <string id="6036531">Bethany has suffered enough. I'm not putting her through that.</string>
  <string id="6036532">We're not doing that.</string>
  <string id="6036533">Carver has suffered enough. I'm not putting him through that.</string>
  <string id="6036534">We're not doing that.</string>
  <string id="6036535">I suppose you're right.</string>
  <string id="6036538">Then I guess there's no other choice.</string>
  <string id="6036539">Then I guess there's no other choice.</string>
  <string id="6036542">There... isn't anything we can do. Not down here.</string>
  <string id="6036545">We're in the middle of nowhere. There's no way... oh, Sunshine...</string>
  <string id="6036548">I thought it was nothing. Hoped, anyway. Idiot!</string>
  <string id="6036551">I'm not going to make it. Not to the surface, not anywhere. It's getting worse.</string>
  <string id="6036554">We're in the middle of nowhere. We can't help him.</string>
  <string id="6036557">It's the blight, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6036560">Just like that templar, Wesley. I'll be just as dead, just as gone.</string>
  <string id="6036561">No, it's...</string>
  <string id="6036564">Carver!</string>
  <string id="6036567">Think we could... take a break? I feel... wrong.</string>
  <string id="6036573">Modify Party</string>
  <string id="6036574">Modify Party</string>
  <string id="6036575">Modify your party configuration.</string>
  <string id="6036576">Clear Party</string>

  <string id="6036593">Varric</string>
  <string id="6036656">If you want my help, you'll pay for my services in advance.</string>
  <string id="6036657">As long as I'm paid up front.</string>
  <string id="6036659">Oh, please. Fixating on what's wise makes you forget what's fun.</string>
  <string id="6036662">You are both tough and shrewd. Very well. I had some money set aside for safety equipment, but it is yours instead.</string>
  <string id="6036673">Anders.</string>
  <string id="6036676">Fancy meeting you here, Stroud.</string>
  <string id="6036679">I could say the same. I thought you were through fighting darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6036682">I'm not here to fight darkspawn. I came looking for you.</string>
  <string id="6036688">You... mean the girl as a recruit? Of course you do.</string>
  <string id="6036691">You... mean the boy as a recruit? Of course you do.</string>
  <string id="6036694">I'm sorry. I know this comes as no comfort to you, but we do not recruit Grey Wardens out of pity. It is no kindness.</string>
  <string id="6036695">If Bethany dies, then so do you. Trust me on that.</string>
  <string id="6036696">Help her, or I kill you.</string>
  <string id="6036697">You think it's kinder to let Bethany die from the blight?</string>
  <string id="6036698">You'd rather she die?</string>
  <string id="6036699">Bethany happens to be a powerful mage. You'd be an idiot not to recruit her.</string>
  <string id="6036700">No pity required.</string>
  <string id="6036701">If Carver dies, then so do you. Trust me on that.</string>
  <string id="6036702">Help him, or I kill you.</string>
  <string id="6036703">You truly think that will help?</string>
  <string id="6036706">You think it's kinder to let Carver die from the blight?</string>
  <string id="6036707">You'd rather he die?</string>
  <string id="6036708">Sometimes it is, yes.</string>
  <string id="6036711">Carver happens to be a fine warrior. You'd be an idiot not to recruit him.</string>
  <string id="6036712">No pity required.</string>
  <string id="6036713">Be that as it may, I cannot.</string>
  <string id="6036716">Stroud, trust me when I say this one is worth your time. With the Blight over, you Wardens don't have recruits lining up.</string>
  <string id="6036719">She'll die anyway. Take her and try... I'm asking you.</string>
  <string id="6036722">He'll die anyway. Take him and try... I'm asking you.</string>
  <string id="6036728">Very well. I will try, but if I do this, then we are even.</string>
  <string id="6036731">If the girl comes, she comes now, and you may not see her again. Being a Grey Warden is not a cure. It is a calling.</string>
  <string id="6036734">Are you sure about this?</string>
  <string id="6036735">I'm sorry, Bethany.</string>
  <string id="6036736">If the boy comes, he comes now, and you may not see him again. Being a Grey Warden is not a cure. It is a calling.</string>
  <string id="6036739">Are you sure about this?</string>
  <string id="6036740">If this is the only way you can live, then it has to be.</string>
  <string id="6036741">It's your only chance.</string>
  <string id="6036742">I wish it hadn't worked out this way.</string>
  <string id="6036743">I'm sorry, Carver.</string>
  <string id="6036744">I'm not sure about anything, but I want you to live.</string>
  <string id="6036745">Not at all.</string>
  <string id="6036746">Then... I guess this is it. Take care of Mother.</string>
  <string id="6036749">Then... I guess this is it. Take care of Mother.</string>
  <string id="6036757">Explain yourself.</string>
  <string id="6036758">This is a case of the right hand not knowing what the left is doing.</string>
  <string id="6036759">It's Brekker's fault, obviously.</string>
  <string id="6036763">Present minor misunderstandings aside, I believe our purposes are the same.</string>
  <string id="6036764">We're on the same side.</string>
  <string id="6036765">You wouldn't do that. The Coterie would avenge me.</string>
  <string id="6036768">Not if there aren't any witnesses.</string>
  <string id="6036771">Someone in your organization has been killing my men. Explain that.</string>
  <string id="6036772">No, you answer my question.</string>
  <string id="6036773">Brekker. Hmm. If you're lying, I'll find you.</string>
  <string id="6036776">Men, we have to get to the bottom of this. Now.</string>

  <string id="6036786">3) Thug Encounter</string>
  <string id="6036792">I am sorry for your loss, Mistress. But I can offer your son mercy only if he turns himself in.</string>
  <string id="6036795">I'm trying to find him, but—</string>
  <string id="6036798">The templars cannot tolerate apostates.</string>
  <string id="6036801">Sobs</string>
  <string id="6036802">He dreams of demons, calling to him, pulling him into their world. Every day it grows harder to wake him.</string>

  <string id="6036836">Brekker</string>
  <string id="6036856">I've had dealings with the Qunari leader. He'd want to know of this.</string>
  <string id="6036857">I could appeal to the Arishok.</string>
  <string id="6036858">You... have dealt with their leader? </string>
  <string id="6036861">If you have interacted with Qunari, you know how they treat those who leave their heathen order. The Arishok would doom this poor creature.</string>
  <string id="6036864">But knowing them is useful. If they challenged you, attacking an ally would only confirm their barbarism. You are still right for the task.</string>
  <string id="6036865">It's changed since that madman Ianto took power around here. Extortion, murder, kidnapping—he does it all.</string>
  <string id="6036902">Bastard.</string>
  <string id="6036908">Tranquility</string>
  <string id="6036909">Seek out a Grey Warden for help in the Deep Roads expedition. Varric heard that one is working as a healer somewhere. A shopkeep named Lirene in Lowtown may have more info.</string>
  <string id="6036913">Forced to stay so close to this shemlen city, I've seen my share of outsiders pass through our camp. Is there something you needed?</string>
  <string id="6036914">I do not wish to discuss my personal life. Let me know if you want to see my wares.</string>
  <string id="6036917">During the day, he keeps away from the templars, but you can usually find him out at night in the Undercity.</string>
  <string id="6036918">I have only the finest Antivan merchandise.</string>
  <string id="6036920">Torpor</string>
  <string id="6036925">Oh... Merrill. So you've returned. How has your time been among the shemlen?</string>

  <string id="6036936">It's been nothing but roses and rainbows, Master Ilen.</string>
  <string id="6036939">This path has been of your own choosing, Merrill. A path that has saddened the clan greatly.</string>
  <string id="6036943">Bodahn</string>
  <string id="6036945">Sandal</string>
  <string id="6036950">I wonder if Bartrand came back to the city. You think I'd be that lucky?</string>
  <string id="6036951">Revenge isn't exactly the most pressing thing on my mind right now.</string>
  <string id="6036952">I don't care about Bartrand.</string>
  <string id="6036953">I'm just glad we got back in one piece.</string>
  <string id="6036954">I don't care about Bartrand.</string>
  <string id="6036955">Just make sure you let me know when you find him.</string>
  <string id="6036956">Bartrand needs to die.</string>
  <string id="6036957">Trust me, you'll be the first to know.</string>
  <string id="6036965">I know.</string>
  <string id="6036968">Thankfully we didn't come away empty-handed.</string>
  <string id="6036971">Luck hasn't exactly been our strong point so far.</string>
  <string id="6036972">Probably not.</string>
  <string id="6036973">This is true.</string>
  <string id="6036976">I'm... sorry about what happened to your sister.</string>
  <string id="6036979">She'll make it. Bethany's a strong girl.</string>
  <string id="6036982">I'm... sorry about what happened to your brother.</string>
  <string id="6036985">He'll make it. Carver's stronger than he thinks.</string>
  <string id="6036988">I should have seen Bartrand's betrayal coming. I'll find that maggot if it's the last thing I do.</string>
  <string id="6036991">I imagine you'll be heading home to... tell the family?</string>
  <string id="6036992">I don't have much choice.</string>
  <string id="6036993">Of course.</string>
  <string id="6036998">Oh, I don't know about that.</string>
  <string id="6037001">The treasure we found in that crypt far outstrips Bartrand's stupid idol. He'll be green with envy when he finds out.</string>
  <string id="6037004">As soon as I get the chance, I'll look up my contacts to make sure we get the best price.</string>
  <string id="6037010">You'll be a wealthy man, Hawke. It wasn't all for nothing.</string>
  <string id="6037011">You'll be a wealthy woman, Hawke. It wasn't all for nothing.</string>
  <string id="6037012">I imagine you'll want to head home, tell your family the good news? We're going to be rich.</string>
  <string id="6037017">Perhaps we should go tell Bartrand the good news? He'll be so pleased.</string>
  <string id="6037020">Act of Mercy</string>
  <string id="6037024">What price? Maker's breath, spit it out!</string>
  <string id="6037025">What does that mean?</string>
  <string id="6037026">The process of becoming a Warden is... unpleasant. And irreversible.</string>
  <string id="6037029">It also means you might never see your sister again.</string>
  <string id="6037032">It also means you might never see your brother again.</string>
  <string id="6037035">He might survive the blight, but at the cost of becoming a Grey Warden. It's not an easy life. Trust me.</string>
  <string id="6037036">What about you? You're not a Grey Warden anymore.</string>
  <string id="6037037">You got away from them.</string>
  <string id="6037038">You think I got away? Eventually they or the Circle will drag me back. I've got no illusions about that.</string>
  <string id="6037039">Is this even possible? How does someone become a Grey Warden?</string>
  <string id="6037040">Would they agree to this?</string>
  <string id="6037041">I can't tell you. But it's not something you can undo once it's done... even if you want to.</string>
  <string id="6037044">This just keeps sounding better and better...</string>
  <string id="6037047">This just keeps sounding better and better...</string>
  <string id="6037050">They might agree to it, however. That's if we can find them in time.</string>
  <string id="6037059">Writing Desk</string>
  <string id="6037066">Perhaps if the clan was more accepting of the ancient ways and not so mired in fear—</string>
  <string id="6037069">Enough. We will not bicker like children in front of strangers. We cannot undo what is done.</string>
  <string id="6037072">My apologies for that... display. Perhaps we can start again?</string>
  <string id="6037075">Do you have any pure ironbark in stock?</string>
  <string id="6037076">I'm looking for ironbark.</string>
  <string id="6037077">What use is ironbark to you? I have never met a shem who could bend it to his will.</string>
  <string id="6037080">Either way, I'm out of stock. I do know where it can be found, but it is impossible to retrieve.</string>
  <string id="6037086">Tal-Vashoth. They seem to accept the role.</string>
  <string id="6037089">Even their rebels conform. Ser Varnell observed one of their bloody exchanges. This poor mage was the only survivor.</string>
  <string id="6037090">And you think this mage was being hunted?</string>
  <string id="6037091">You're sure he's Tal-Vashoth?</string>
  <string id="6037092">I am certain no thinking creature would willingly submit to this. If he was not running before, he has seized the opportunity now.</string>
  <string id="6037093">Tal-Vashoth is the word. Ser Varnell observed one of their bloody exchanges. This poor mage was the only survivor.</string>
  <string id="6037099">Roars</string>

  <string id="6037106">Screams</string>
  <string id="6037110">Oh, my baby! You made it home!</string>
  <string id="6037113">No.</string>
  <string id="6037116">Is she... coming back?</string>
  <string id="6037119">Is he... coming back?</string>
  <string id="6037122">I'm sorry, Mother.</string>
  <string id="6037125">I don't know.</string>
  <string id="6037128">Cries</string>
  <string id="6037136">My order will soon realize the Qunari presence is more than a test of faith—it is an open challenge. But for now, I must act on my own.</string>
  <string id="6037139">Helping this mage shows how Qunari heresy cannot be ignored. His flight is vital.</string>
  <string id="6037290">And I do that.</string>
  <string id="6037298">Go to the location marked on the Free Marches world map to answer the letter's anonymous plea for help.</string>
  <string id="6037308">What's going on?</string>
  <string id="6037311">Please don't do anything.</string>
  <string id="6037314">Mistress Bethany is being taken to the Circle of Magi in the Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6037315">A little tour is fine, but this better not be permanent.</string>
  <string id="6037316">Not to stay, I hope.</string>
  <string id="6037317">Of course it's permanent. It had to happen eventually, didn't it?</string>
  <string id="6037320">Over my dead body.</string>
  <string id="6037321">You're not taking her!</string>
  <string id="6037322">It's done! Don't make it worse!</string>
  <string id="6037325">The Gallows is horrible! You can't go there!</string>
  <string id="6037326">That's a death sentence!</string>
  <string id="6037327">I have to. That's where the apostates go, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6037330">Consider yourselves fortunate. The viscount has requested we spare your family the punishment for harboring a dangerous mage.</string>
  <string id="6037333">Consider yourselves fortunate. Her cooperation allows us to spare you the punishment for harboring a dangerous mage... this once.</string>
  <string id="6037336">Oh, Bethany! What will happen to you?</string>
  <string id="6037339">Don't worry, Mother. I'll be fine.</string>
  <string id="6037342">Look after her, big brother.</string>
  <string id="6037345">Look after her.</string>
  <string id="6037348">Cries</string>
  <string id="6037354">Runaway's Cavern</string>
  <string id="6037355">Leave Area</string>
  <string id="6037359">Thrask</string>
  <string id="6037367">It just seems like releasing a bird, cage and all.</string>
  <string id="6037370">We do what we can to step toward what is right. That must be enough.</string>
  <string id="6037371">I know the Keeper. I'll make sure she takes you in.</string>
  <string id="6037372">I have friends in the Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6037373">Then... she does not hate humans?</string>
  <string id="6037376">Oh, you don't know what a relief that is. I knew she could help me!</string>
  <string id="6037381">I am Master Ilen, a crafter for this clan. </string>
  <string id="6037384">Enter the cave and resolve the situation with the apostates peacefully, if possible.</string>
  <string id="6037385">Check the caverns. My fellow templars could arrive at any moment.</string>
  <string id="6037388">You think?</string>
  <string id="6037391">He has followed every direction, and made no aggressive moves even when taunted. Were I in his place, I could have fled.</string>
  <string id="6037394">Qunari or not, I can only assume he wants to be led to freedom.</string>
  <string id="6037397">Runaways' Cavern</string>
  <string id="6037399">And if you're wrong, I have to deal with it.</string>
  <string id="6037400">But you don't know for sure.</string>
  <string id="6037401">Champion. Welcome.</string>
  <string id="6037404">Tell me why I'm here.</string>
  <string id="6037405">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="6037407">Always a pleasure, and may I say that outfit was a wise choice?</string>
  <string id="6037408">Nice to see you.</string>
  <string id="6037409">What is this urgent matter you spoke of?</string>
  <string id="6037410">Can I help?</string>
  <string id="6037420">Wounded Coast Approach</string>
  <string id="6037422">That is why I went to Lowtown. You are either capable of the discretion and skill that I need or you are not.</string>
  <string id="6037423">Wounded Coast Approach</string>
  <string id="6037557">I will pay upon your return. I know this may be a reluctant duty. Let us hope there are no unforeseen incidents.</string>
  <string id="6037561">Removing Bethany...</string>
  <string id="6037562">Removing Carver...</string>
  <string id="6037565">Removing Fake Bethany/Carver if they're in the party.</string>
  <string id="6037574">So you're back.</string>
  <string id="6037577">Oh, thank the Maker! Please talk some sense into him!</string>
  <string id="6037580">Carver, what are you wearing?</string>
  <string id="6037583">I've joined the Templar Order. There's no point in trying to talk me out of it; it's done.</string>
  <string id="6037584">Don't be a fool, Carver.</string>
  <string id="6037585">Are you mad?</string>
  <string id="6037586">I'm not a fool!</string>
  <string id="6037589">Are you sure this is wise? This isn't like being a knight.</string>
  <string id="6037590">Are you mad?</string>
  <string id="6037591">I know that! I'm not an idiot!</string>
  <string id="6037594">Good plan! Become a slave to the Chantry! Brilliant!</string>
  <string id="6037595">Are you mad?</string>
  <string id="6037596">You'd rather I keep tagging along after you, in case you need me?</string>
  <string id="6037599">Do you actually want to be a templar?</string>
  <string id="6037600">Is that what you want?</string>
  <string id="6037601">Do what you want.</string>
  <string id="6037602">It's a good idea.</string>
  <string id="6037603">If you think it's best, I won't argue.</string>
  <string id="6037604">It's a good idea.</string>
  <string id="6037605">If it gets you out of the house...</string>
  <string id="6037606">It's a good idea.</string>
  <string id="6037607">See, Mother? I told you he wouldn't care.</string>
  <string id="6037610">See, Mother? I told you she wouldn't care.</string>
  <string id="6037613">You realize that you're related to an apostate.</string>
  <string id="6037614">What about me?</string>
  <string id="6037615">See, Mother? I told you he'd only think of himself.</string>
  <string id="6037618">See, Mother? I told you she'd only think of herself.</string>
  <string id="6037621">I want to be someone, more than just your brother. This is my chance.</string>
  <string id="6037624">Carver, please! The Order is so dangerous!</string>
  <string id="6037627">I'll be fine, Mother. You don't need to worry about me.</string>
  <string id="6037630">And you don't need to worry about me turning you in. I know the value of family.</string>
  <string id="6037636">Cries</string>
  <string id="6037643">Adding Carver.</string>
  <string id="6037646">Adding Bethany.</string>
  <string id="6037662">There was an incident within the Gallows. A number of phylacteries were destroyed and several mages took the opportunity to escape.</string>
  <string id="6037668">You've returned. Is there something you need?</string>
  <string id="6037675">As Champion of Kirkwall, you have shown once again that you are on the side of justice.</string>
  <string id="6037682">Kill Thrask and any accompanying templars so Grace and her Starkhaven apostates can escape Kirkwall safely.</string>
  <string id="6037683">Escort the Starkhaven apostates safely to Thrask at the entrance of the cave. They will be returned to the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6037684">Return to Thrask at the mouth of the cave to convince him that the apostates are dead so that Grace and her people can flee Kirkwall safely.</string>
  <string id="6037685">Is freedom so helpful? A new life with that collar seems doubtful.</string>
  <string id="6037686">Where will he go like this?</string>
  <string id="6037687">If you were important enough to know, I would need someone else. But if you insist: What is your family name?</string>
  <string id="6037690">My name is Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6037693">Strong. Very Fereldan.</string>
  <string id="6037696">The Qunari have hardly pressured the southern nations. You have not seen as many converts, or those who refused.</string>
  <string id="6037701">If this action—if any action—can lessen their influence, it must be done.</string>
  <string id="6037852">You have a sister in the Circle of Magi, do you not? Bethany is her name?</string>
  <string id="6037865">They're here! The templars have come to take us back to the Circle!</string>
  <string id="6037931">You've gone too far, Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6037932">Orsino is right.</string>
  <string id="6037936">That's enough, Orsino. Stand down.</string>
  <string id="6037937">Meredith is right.</string>

  <string id="6038230">How well did you guard your own mother? Did she not die at a blood mage's hands? </string>
  <string id="6038458">You claim to have Kirkwall's interests at heart? Show it. Prove that you are Champion in more than just name.</string>
  <string id="6038512">The apostates were set free to seek their own path.</string>
  <string id="6038562">Return to your homes. This farce is over.</string>

  <string id="6038574">Maybe she's testing daddy's boots. The pretty ones always have something to prove.</string>
  <string id="6038587">Two weeks in the Deep Roads? How bad could it be?</string>
  <string id="6038588">The dwarf says the darkspawn are mostly gone. He'd better be right...</string>
  <string id="6038589">How much longer before we go? I gave up a job on the docks for this.</string>
  <string id="6038593">How long are we supposed to be down here?</string>
  <string id="6038594">The darkspawn are all gone now, right?</string>
  <string id="6038595">What's that smell? Is it... sulfur?</string>
  <string id="6038596">We're all going to catch the blight, I just know it.</string>
  <string id="6038597">No more deep mushrooms. Those things taste like dogshit.</string>
  <string id="6038598">I hope we don't have to dig through that.</string>
  <string id="6038602">What's so special about this place? Looks like the rest of the Deep Roads to me.</string>
  <string id="6038603">So you all found what you were looking for? This it?</string>
  <string id="6038604">It's just all rubble and ruins. There treasure here?</string>
  <string id="6038612">You see Bodahn's boy walk off?</string>
  <string id="6038615">No. Did you?</string>
  <string id="6038618">I'm not his mother, am I? Bet he got eaten.</string>
  <string id="6038621">If you wander around in the dark, you'll be eaten by a grue. I read that somewhere.</string>
  <string id="6038624">There's no such thing as a grue. Now, darkspawn—those are plenty real.</string>
  <string id="6038627">Think we'll need to turn around?</string>
  <string id="6038630">Let's hope not. That dwarf will beat us within an inch of our lives if we do.</string>
  <string id="6038633">Not our fault, is it?</string>
  <string id="6038636">Well he can't beat the cave-in, can he?</string>
  <string id="6038639">I hate just sitting around, waiting.</string>
  <string id="6038642">Better than digging. Digging makes noise, attracts things.</string>
  <string id="6038645">Good point.</string>
  <string id="6038651">Bartrand sure seems taken by this place.</string>
  <string id="6038654">Why? I don't get it.</string>
  <string id="6038657">Says he's never seen anything like it. Maybe some kind of forgotten city.</string>
  <string id="6038660">The dwarves forget stuff like this?</string>
  <string id="6038663">I guess so.</string>
  <string id="6038672">A few weeks in the Deep Roads won't be that bad, right?</string>
  <string id="6038673">That dwarf better be right. I don't want to catch the blight down there.</string>
  <string id="6038678">We're not staying here long, right?</string>
  <string id="6038679">Them darkspawn haven't attacked us... yet.</string>
  <string id="6038681">We better not catch the blight.</string>
  <string id="6038683">We're supposed to dig through that?</string>
  <string id="6038687">This place supposed to be something special?</string>

  <string id="6039392">The sister called him Ketojan. You are Saarebas?</string>
  <string id="6039393">Is Saarebas a name or title?</string>
  <string id="6039394">Saarebas is his role and his name, as you understand it. It is the accusation and acknowledgement of being a mage.</string>
  <string id="6039397">And you are Arvaarad?</string>
  <string id="6039400">My role is to hold the leash and hunt the gray ones who leave the Qun.</string>

  <string id="6039402">Why do you collar your mages?</string>
  <string id="6039403">We leash Saarebas because they are dangerous and contagious. Not even your templars fully grasp that threat.</string>

  <string id="6039515">Great, more of them.</string>
  <string id="6039522">You speak as if ignorance is your natural condition. The bodies of his slain karataam could lead only here.</string>
  <string id="6039525">No doubt they were cast from your shoulders as you or your partner thieves grew weak.</string>
  <string id="6039532">The members of his karataam were killed by Tal-Vashoth, but their disposal leads only here, to Saarebas and you.</string>
  <string id="6039545">Careful with your accusations. I didn't kill this mage's karataam.</string>
  <string id="6039546">I didn't kill them.</string>
  <string id="6039549">I just got here, coming from the other way. If there was a trail, I didn't leave it.</string>
  <string id="6039550">Someone left a trail?</string>
  <string id="6039570">Tal-Vashoth killed them. That battle was expected. The survival of Saarebas without his Arvaarad was not.</string>
  <string id="6039604">Yet you are here with Saarebas. The crime is his freedom, his leash held by unknowing basra.</string>
  <string id="6039607">We will not allow that danger to continue. Let your own mages doom you—Saarebas will be properly confined.</string>
  <string id="6039610">And if he doesn't want to go back?</string>
  <string id="6039688">You, basra—your kind have no sense. The opportunity for reason will be forced upon you.</string>
  <string id="6039691">You will all be brought to the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6039692">I've met with your leader. The Arishok would not want a potential ally challenged in this way.</string>
  <string id="6039693">The Arishok knows of me.</string>
  <string id="6039707">Claiming to know the will of the Arishok with Saarebas in your care is maraas imekari, a child bleating without meaning.</string>
  <string id="6039710">The Arishok knows what is to be done with Saarebas who lose their Arvaarad. There is no greater threat to their control.</string>
  <string id="6039711">The power that he has, that all Saarebas have, draws from chaos and demons. They can never be in control.</string>
  <string id="6039714">So you fear them.</string>
  <string id="6039717">I wield the same power, and I'm no danger to you unless I choose to be.</string>
  <string id="6039718">But I'm a mage too.</string>
  <string id="6039719">You... are Saarebas? Bas Saarebas?</string>
  <string id="6039722">Vashedan! Nehraa sataa karasaam!</string>
  <string id="6039725">You spewed your words at me, like a demon trying to poison my control! Like this mage, the Qun requires your death!</string>
  <string id="6039728">But we're no threat to each other.</string>
  <string id="6039731">Bas Saarebas! You will be no threat to anyone!</string>
  <string id="6039743">It is my role to secure Saarebas. It is the role of another to purge the perversions of your kind.</string>

  <string id="6039937">Let us through, you flaming blighter! We're not staying in this pit!</string>
  <string id="6039940">Then get back on your ship and leave. Kirkwall has no more room for refugees.</string>
  <string id="6039943">The ship's already gone! We paid good coin to get here!</string>
  <string id="6039946">You and half of Ferelden. There's nothing I can do! The city is full!</string>
  <string id="6039947">One of the guards said you were letting in people who have business in the city.</string>
  <string id="6039948">A guard told me differently.</string>
  <string id="6039949">If you keep packing people into this fortress, there's going to be trouble.</string>
  <string id="6039950">This is ridiculous.</string>
  <string id="6039951">You can bet your ass there will be.</string>
  <string id="6039954">If we keep packing people into the city, it'll be far worse.</string>
  <string id="6039957">You wouldn't be out here if nobody could enter.</string>
  <string id="6039958">You must be letting some in.</string>
  <string id="6039959">That's right! We've seen you let lots of people through!</string>
  <string id="6039962">Citizens and merchants that make it worth our while. I'll assume that you don't have any more coin than these gentlemen?</string>
  <string id="6039965">Surely there's a bit of extra room for the pretty people?</string>
  <string id="6039966">It's a big city.</string>
  <string id="6039967">I find keeping my neck away from Knight-Commander Meredith's blade far more attractive than any of you.</string>
  <string id="6039970">We've been letting you Fereldans in for months. You're too late. There's no more room!</string>
  <string id="6039973">But we have family here. Doesn't that mean anything?</string>
  <string id="6039976">But we've got family here!</string>
  <string id="6039979">We'll find some ships to take you all back to Ferelden—eventually. Until then, you stay here.</string>
  <string id="6039980">Tell me who's in charge of this bloody mess.</string>
  <string id="6039981">Who decided this?</string>
  <string id="6039998">I am... unbound. Odd... wrong... but you deserve honor.</string>
  <string id="6040001">You are now Basvaarad, worthy of following. I thank your intent, even if it was... wrong.</string>
  <string id="6040004">I know the will of Arvaarad. I must return as demanded. It is the wisdom... of the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6040011">I can't let this decision stand.</string>
  <string id="6040012">I refuse to allow this.</string>
  <string id="6040017">Could you have returned if I'd let these others live?</string>
  <string id="6040018">What if I hadn't killed Arvaarad?</string>
  <string id="6040021">Here is the dung pile I caught leaking next week's shipment schedule.</string>
  <string id="6040148">Certainty is comfort. That is the way of Qunari. The way of the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6040151">Take this secret thing, Basvaarad. Remember this day.</string>
  <string id="6040161">Arvaarad couldn't kill me. Perhaps he was wrong about your death, too.</string>
  <string id="6040162">What if Arvaarad was wrong?</string>
  <string id="6040163">I'm not doing your job for you.</string>
  <string id="6040164">I won't be used.</string>
  <string id="6040396">Pickax</string>
  <string id="6040537">I've heard claims like that a thousand times already. Trust me.</string>
  <string id="6040540">The city's been closed by order of the viscount and Knight-Commander Meredith, whose fortress you're standing in.</string>
  <string id="6040543">But as far as you're concerned, I'm in charge.</string>
  <string id="6040544">There must be someone else in charge we can talk to.</string>
  <string id="6040545">Who decided this?</string>
  <string id="6040546">Surely there's someone higher up that we could persuade.</string>
  <string id="6040547">Who decided this?</string>
  <string id="6040548">What would it take to make you change your mind?</string>
  <string id="6040549">How much to get in?</string>
  <string id="6040550">No foreigner can enter unless they can prove they have coin to bring into the city.</string>
  <string id="6040553">You mean a bribe.</string>
  <string id="6040556">Technically, the viscount's ordered that no one enters. You want to be a special case, you have to be special.</string>
  <string id="6040559">That's outrageous! It took all our coin just to get here!</string>
  <string id="6040562">You want eyes looking the other way, that takes convincing. And the price goes up each day this continues.</string>
  <string id="6040563">Perhaps if we knew exactly what it would take to get in...</string>
  <string id="6040564">How much to get in?</string>
  <string id="6040565">There must be something we can work out.</string>
  <string id="6040566">How much to get in?</string>
  <string id="6040575">We came here to speak to our uncle, Gamlen Amell, and we won't leave until we do.</string>
  <string id="6040576">Find my uncle. Now.</string>
  <string id="6040577">Our uncle is Gamlen Amell. He knows we're coming. Surely someone could find him.</string>
  <string id="6040578">Be reasonable.</string>
  <string id="6040579">If you find our uncle, Gamlen Amell, you might just have a few less refugees bothering you.</string>
  <string id="6040580">Wouldn't you rather we left?</string>
  <string id="6040581">Gamlen. I know that name...</string>
  <string id="6040584">He's a nobleman here in the city. Our family has an estate.</string>
  <string id="6040587">He's a nobleman here in the city. Our family has an estate.</string>
  <string id="6040590">A nobleman? The only Gamlen I know is a weasel who couldn't rub two coppers together.</string>
  <string id="6040593">He comes back, I'll bring you to him. But I don't have time to—</string>
  <string id="6040596">What? You're going to let them through?</string>
  <string id="6040599">I didn't say anything about—</string>
  <string id="6040602">We've been here for four days! They just got here!</string>
  <string id="6040605">That's it! We're carving our way out of here. Men!</string>
  <string id="6040615">Unbelievable.</string>
  <string id="6040618">Captain! Are you all right?</string>
  <string id="6040621">I am, no thanks to you. Where is everyone? Go find them. I want this kept under control!</string>
  <string id="6040624">You have my thanks.</string>
  <string id="6040627">Look, I can't get you into the city. It's not my decision, but I'll find your uncle and bring him here.</string>
  <string id="6040632">Ser Varnell</string>
  <string id="6040634">I'll see what I can do.</string>
  <string id="6040635">I'll try my best.</string>
  <string id="6040637">You have fortuitous timing, Champion. I was just about to send for you.</string>
  <string id="6040638">Well, that's gratitude. I fought so you could go die, anyway?</string>
  <string id="6040639">This is how you say thanks?</string>
  <string id="6040660">If I suspect that is no longer the case, then I may decide your status needs to change.</string>
  <string id="6040661">So after all of this, now you want to die?</string>
  <string id="6040662">You're accepting death?</string>
  <string id="6040663">I commit to the most difficult choice: the truth of the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6040666">What if it's wrong?</string>
  <string id="6040688">He won't tell me who he is working with!</string>
  <string id="6040691">Inside Caverns</string>
  <string id="6040692">Inside Caverns</string>

  <string id="6040708">I don't get it... my sources saw people making deliveries here just a week ago. This... looks like it's been empty for months.</string>
  <string id="6040709">I do not want to die, I want to live by the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6040712">Which means dying.</string>
  <string id="6040715">Yes. Is that hard to grasp?</string>
  <string id="6040764">Someone's coming! The Champion!</string>
  <string id="6040767">We know you're working for Meredith!</string>
  <string id="6040770">We know you're spying for Orsino!</string>
  <string id="6040773">Run! We'll handle this.</string>
  <string id="6040781">Many say that, before they know certainty.</string>
  <string id="6040782">If you force choice, it is not choice. Your doubt does not make me wrong.</string>
  <string id="6040785">Losing to you does not make him wrong. He spoke the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6040788">You are an apostate. One who operates freely only because you have been a protector to this city.</string>
  <string id="6040791">A Torn Note</string>

...will not tell you again: it's not safe to bring new recruits to our meetings. Meredith has eyes everywhere. Bring anyone who claims to be against her to Gardibali's Warehouse at night. We must ensure their loyalty, lest Meredith discover us before we are ready to confront her...</string>
  <string id="6040806">Undercity Warrens</string>
  <string id="6040811">You're from Ferelden, too? Hope you weren't expecting any kind of welcome here.</string>

  <string id="6040813">Bloody Marcher swine! If the Blight was here instead, you can bet they'd all be flocking to Ferelden!</string>
  <string id="6040814">They keep us here any longer, there'll be blood.</string>
  <string id="6040818">They're going to send us back to the Blight? I don't think so!</string>
  <string id="6040819">Even if he was here a week ago, there's no one here now.</string>
  <string id="6040820">The trail is cold.</string>
  <string id="6040821">This is still the best chance we've got to find my brother. Let's go in.</string>
  <string id="6040822">This is still our best lead. We might find something that'll take us to Bartrand.</string>
  <string id="6040823">We should look around.</string>
  <string id="6040824">You think he put the cobwebs up to discourage tax collectors?</string>
  <string id="6040825">Maybe it's some kind of trick?</string>
  <string id="6040829">I told you he was after us!</string>
  <string id="6040830">I told you she was hunting us!</string>
  <string id="6040834">You got my letter.</string>
  <string id="6040838">Petrice's Safehouse</string>
  <string id="6040840">My thoughts exactly.</string>
  <string id="6040841">You're thinking it's a trap? Great! It's been ages since my brother tried to kill me!</string>
  <string id="6040844">Deserter</string>
  <string id="6040848">Deserter Leader</string>
  <string id="6040850">My job ended when we exited the city. The rest is up to you.</string>
  <string id="6040851">Do what you want.</string>
  <string id="6040852">You know of certainty and borders. You are closer to the Qunari than you admit.</string>
  <string id="6040865">So that's how you greet your brother is it, Bartrand? Fine. Say hello, Bianca!</string>
  <string id="6040869">I'll take you all!</string>
  <string id="6040870">You want a piece of me?</string>
  <string id="6040871">Let's dance, you sons of bitches!</string>
  <string id="6040872">Bartrand! I'm coming for you, you nug-humping bastard!</string>
  <string id="6040882">What?</string>
  <string id="6040885">What happened in that house that you fear to tell me?</string>
  <string id="6040889">Fine!</string>
  <string id="6040892">But the real way is a lot more depressing...</string>
  <string id="6040907">No... Not him. I can't do this.</string>
  <string id="6040910">To arms!</string>
  <string id="6040914">These corpses aren't even stiff yet, Hawke. Somebody's been in here today.</string>
  <string id="6040917">What did my brother do to these men? They were completely out of their heads.</string>
  <string id="6040920">Speak to my assistant, Elsa. She can tell you whatever you need to know about the fugitives.</string>
  <string id="6040926">Bartrand... what have you done?</string>
  <string id="6040932">Your role would change little if you accepted the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6040937">I have chosen. It is bred in the bone.</string>
  <string id="6040938">Others of your kind live outside the Qun. You could join them.</string>
  <string id="6040939">Join the Tal-Vashoth.</string>
  <string id="6040944">Hugin</string>
  <string id="6040955">Existing is not a choice.</string>
  <string id="6040958">It is the only choice. Asit tal-eb. It is to be.</string>
  <string id="6040967">I was outside my karataam. I may be corrupted. I cannot know. How I return is my choice.</string>
  <string id="6040970">It must be, but that does not mean there is no meaning.</string>
  <string id="6040974">Varric? Is that you? Praise the Ancestors!</string>
  <string id="6040975">No.</string>
  <string id="6040978">You were doomed from the start?</string>
  <string id="6040981">They are not my kind. I am Qunari. They are not.</string>
  <string id="6040984">They have chosen to be free.</string>
  <string id="6040987">Free? They have refused what they are. I... can't choose to not be.</string>
  <string id="6041022">That's it? That's how you know what he wants?</string>
  <string id="6041025">Such impeccable manners.</string>
  <string id="6041028">Eh, I'm not seeing a lot of fire for freedom in those eyes.</string>
  <string id="6041031">Was that clear? I don't know what it really wants.</string>
  <string id="6041034">I don't... I don't know if I understood that.</string>
  <string id="6041037">Pfft, this thing's dim as a runt mabari.</string>
  <string id="6041040">The eyes of a slave. Does he want freedom or a master?</string>
  <string id="6041043">I don't know if he understood you. I know I didn't understand him.</string>
  <string id="6041049">Not exactly a spirited response.</string>
  <string id="6041054">Hold up—I know this man. He's Bartrand's steward.</string>
  <string id="6041068">Are we under attack?</string>
  <string id="6041071">Darktown is flooded with people trying to get away from all this.</string>
  <string id="6041074">This is new. Any idea what's going on?</string>
  <string id="6041077">Let me guess: our friends from Par Vollen decided to take over after all?</string>
  <string id="6041080">Sounds like fun! Anything I should know about?</string>
  <string id="6041083">The Qunari are assaulting the city—and fast. The Arishok planned this for who knows how long.</string>
  <string id="6041086">I'll rally the guardsmen. I suggest heading to your estate in Hightown. Be careful.</string>
  <string id="6041089">We should head to the Keep to rally my guardsmen. Whatever happens, be careful.</string>
  <string id="6041094">Hugin? What happened here?</string>
  <string id="6041097">Varric, your brother... That statue he brought out of the Deep Roads... Bartrand said it sang to him. Even after he sold it.</string>
  <string id="6041110">What did he do to the guard to turn them to this?</string>
  <string id="6041111">What has Bartrand done?</string>
  <string id="6041112">I haven't seen anyone alive in here except for guards. What happened to the rest of the staff?</string>
  <string id="6041113">Where are the other servants?</string>
  <string id="6041114">I'll find Bartrand and put an end to this.</string>
  <string id="6041115">Tell us where he is.</string>
  <string id="6041116">Everything will be all right. You're safe now.</string>
  <string id="6041117">Try to stay calm.</string>
  <string id="6041118">I assume you mean he's crazy, not just very upset?</string>
  <string id="6041119">Define mad for me.</string>
  <string id="6041127">Petrice might take you back if death is the only other option.</string>
  <string id="6041128">Go back to the sister.</string>
  <string id="6041129">The sister was not honest.</string>
  <string id="6041132">What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="6041135">I cannot say what she wanted, but it was certainty not of the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6041138">And her guard smelled of death.</string>
  <string id="6041139">Good day, Champion of Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6041148">Knight-Commander Meredith has informed me that you will be tracking down the apostates on behalf of the templars.</string>
  <string id="6041152">Why does Meredith have a Tranquil assistant?</string>
  <string id="6041153">Aren't you Tranquil?</string>
  <string id="6041154">What do you know about the De Launcets?</string>
  <string id="6041155">Tell me about the family.</string>
  <string id="6041158">Viscount's Keep</string>
  <string id="6041162">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6041164">Viscount's Keep</string>
  <string id="6041167">Lowtown</string>
  <string id="6041175">One of our miners, Sabin, has been leaking information. Do you know him? He claims to be from your hometown in Ferelden.</string>
  <string id="6041178">I would like you to get this festering sore to divulge who is behind the thefts. When you are ready, I will bring Sabin to you.</string>
  <string id="6041192">The knight-commander wishes to speak to you.</string>
  <string id="6041195">Chantry</string>
  <string id="6041202">I would not expect you to recall every pisspot from your past.</string>
  <string id="6041206">Bring Sabin back to my place.</string>
  <string id="6041207">I'm ready. Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6041208">I've other things to deal with first.</string>
  <string id="6041209">I'll be back later.</string>
  <string id="6041210">Excellent idea! I will get him now.</string>
  <string id="6041219">Return to me soon. This is a matter of great urgency!</string>
  <string id="6041222">Are you ready to question Sabin?</string>
  <string id="6041234">There are three of them: Huon, Emile, and Evelina.</string>
  <string id="6041241">I want to hear about Huon.</string>
  <string id="6041242">Tell me about Huon.</string>
  <string id="6041246">Huon is an elf. He was apprehended in the alienage ten years ago. His wife, Nyssa, works for a dressmaker in Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6041249">Yes. Nyssa insists she has not seen Huon since he joined the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6041252">The second apostate is Emile de Launcet, fifth son of the Comte de Launcet.</string>
  <string id="6041255">The De Launcets have a home in Hightown, but are often out during the day. They are generally home by evening.</string>
  <string id="6041258">Evelina was trained for eight years in the Circle in Ferelden. She was last seen in her former residence among the refugee community in Darktown.</string>
  <string id="6041259">Did the templars run into her in Darktown?</string>
  <string id="6041260">Last seen?</string>
  <string id="6041261">The knight-commander believes Tranquil mages to be efficient and single-minded. I, in particular, am extremely organized.</string>
  <string id="6041262">Could Huon be hiding among the other elves in the alienage?</string>
  <string id="6041263">He's from the alienage?</string>
  <string id="6041264">How did she come to be in Kirkwall?</string>
  <string id="6041265">Ferelden?</string>
  <string id="6041266">Leave nothing. It must be clean with no ties. It...</string>
  <string id="6041269">Hawke. It was Hawke, right? From the streets?</string>
  <string id="6041270">Well. My helpful associate from the streets.</string>
  <string id="6041271">The viscount, and others, feel that peace begins with appeasement. This mage would likely be returned to his brutal kin.</string>
  <string id="6041274">He can serve a better purpose. I want him free. He must be guided from the city without alerting his people, or being seen in my care.</string>
  <string id="6041279">You... took the Qunari from the city? Without incident?</string>
  <string id="6041297">If not you, no one. The passage here leads to the warrens of the Undercity. It is dangerous, but you are capable.</string>
  <string id="6041300">I hope you can do this quickly. He is a gentle thing, but he could be so much more.</string>
  <string id="6041324">I want no part of your little war. Pay me what I'm due.</string>
  <string id="6041325">I don't care. Just pay me.</string>
  <string id="6041358">The bodies of the mage's karataam led right to us. Why?</string>
  <string id="6041359">This was a set-up.</string>
  <string id="6041360">You come back speaking their language and think to lecture me?</string>
  <string id="6041384">If I knew you were the one they were talking about, I'd have warned you.</string>
  <string id="6041387">I don't hold with kidnapping. Not after what I went through.</string>
  <string id="6041390">I don't like where this is heading.</string>
  <string id="6041391">I have a bad feeling...</string>
  <string id="6041392">Tell me the truth. I'm in no mood for games.</string>
  <string id="6041393">Who was kidnapped?</string>
  <string id="6041397">They said someone was spying, we needed leverage, someone they cared about. As a hostage.</string>
  <string id="6041400">We just got word they took some girl from the Grey Wardens.</string>
  <string id="6041401">We just got word they took some lad from the Grey Wardens.</string>
  <string id="6041402">We just got word they pulled some girl from the Circle. A... sister, I think.</string>
  <string id="6041403">You bastards kidnapped my sister!</string>
  <string id="6041404">Bethany!</string>
  <string id="6041405">We just got word they took one of the templar apprentices. Lad named Carver.</string>
  <string id="6041406">You bastards kidnapped my brother!</string>
  <string id="6041407">Carver!</string>
  <string id="6041408">We just got word they pulled some Fereldan mage out of Hightown.</string>
  <string id="6041409">We just got word they pulled some Dalish woman from a mansion in Hightown.</string>
  <string id="6041410">We just got word they took in some pirate lass. Apparently, she had quite a mouth on her.</string>
  <string id="6041411">We just got word they kidnapped some elf from Tevinter. Took out four men before they subdued him.</string>
  <string id="6041412">We just got word they pulled it off, right before you came here.</string>
  <string id="6041415">Comte Guillaume de Launcet is a minor noble from Orlais. He and his wife came to the Free Marches over three decades ago.</string>
  <string id="6041418">Emile was born in Kirkwall, and sent to the Circle at age six.</string>
  <string id="6041430">Parshaara! Quit your struggling, woman!</string>
  <string id="6041433">Please... leave me be!</string>
  <string id="6041436">We cannot. We will not.</string>
  <string id="6041439">Teth a! Bas!</string>
  <string id="6041442">Then the Arishok failed to take you captive. Unfortunate.</string>
  <string id="6041451">The templars' searches uncovered nothing. The templars have also concluded that few other elves would risk hiding him.</string>
  <string id="6041459">Grunts</string>
  <string id="6041471">I am Knight-Commander Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6041474">Where is he?</string>
  <string id="6041475">Just tell me where they went. I can't waste any time.</string>
  <string id="6041476">Where is she?</string>
  <string id="6041477">My sister's a sanctimonious prig. I'm better off without her.</string>
  <string id="6041478">No great loss.</string>
  <string id="6041479">Where is he?</string>
  <string id="6041480">Your friends don't know much about my relationship with my brother, do they?</string>
  <string id="6041481">No great loss.</string>
  <string id="6041482">Where is he?</string>
  <string id="6041483">Anders!</string>
  <string id="6041484">I was getting tired of his gloom and doom, anyway.</string>
  <string id="6041485">No great loss.</string>
  <string id="6041486">Merrill!</string>
  <string id="6041487">I don't think her family would ever have accepted me, anyway...</string>
  <string id="6041488">No great loss.</string>
  <string id="6041489">She'd have thrown me over for the first two-mast ship, anyway.</string>
  <string id="6041490">No great loss.</string>
  <string id="6041491">You bastards are going to pay if you hurt her!</string>
  <string id="6041492">Isabela!</string>
  <string id="6041493">Where is he?</string>
  <string id="6041494">Eh... Things weren't going anywhere with us.</string>
  <string id="6041495">No great loss.</string>
  <string id="6041496">You bastards are going to pay if you hurt him!</string>
  <string id="6041497">Fenris!</string>
  <string id="6041498">Where are they?</string>
  <string id="6041501">I thought you'd be the last person to join a conspiracy of apostate mages.</string>
  <string id="6041502">Why are you here?</string>
  <string id="6041503">I thought Cullen threw you out of the templars.</string>
  <string id="6041504">Why are you here?</string>
  <string id="6041505">He did. But... I can't just sit this out.</string>
  <string id="6041508">The knight-commander needs to go, that's what Thrask says. Without her, we have a chance at peace.</string>
  <string id="6041512">Your friends were way off the mark if they thought that would make me cave.</string>
  <string id="6041513">No great loss.</string>
  <string id="6041514">You bastards are going to pay if you've hurt anyone.</string>
  <string id="6041515">How dare you!</string>
  <string id="6041517">Evelina claims to have fled the Blight, not the Circle. </string>
  <string id="6041520">Our files indicate she petitioned Meredith for financial support of numerous other pre-adolescent Blight survivors.</string>
  <string id="6041528">We'll need to move quickly, then.</string>
  <string id="6041529">Of course.</string>
  <string id="6041530">Good. I'll overlook your own use of magic, for the moment.</string>
  <string id="6041533">Good. Your skills will be sorely needed.</string>
  <string id="6041536">This isn't my fight. I'm not about to take on an army.</string>
  <string id="6041537">Why should I?</string>
  <string id="6041538">I'm not one of your templars. I don't take orders.</string>
  <string id="6041539">You're on your own.</string>
  <string id="6041543">You think I'm a fool, do you? I saw you using magic.</string>
  <string id="6041546">This is your city as well as mine. Defend it.</string>
  <string id="6041549">Head to the Keep, and I will see if I can find more of my men. These creatures will pay for this outrage.</string>
  <string id="6041558">Yes. They tracked her there, but she killed several pursuers. The templars believe she is the most dangerous apostate.</string>
  <string id="6041560">They left for the ruins on the Wounded Coast. We have a kind of base there.</string>
  <string id="6041563">They... they should have just talked to you. I know you're a reasonable person. You have to see how dangerous Meredith is.</string>
  <string id="6041566">We weren't going to hurt him. </string>
  <string id="6041572">Thrask says Meredith will cause open war with the mages if she stays in charge. We have to take her down.</string>
  <string id="6041573">Do you mean the templar Thrask?</string>
  <string id="6041574">Thrask?</string>
  <string id="6041575">You've worked with him. He's a good man.</string>
  <string id="6041578">You should help us, not fight us. All we want is someone sane in Meredith's place.</string>
  <string id="6041582">They aren't apostates. They want the Circle. They want it to work like it's supposed to, to protect them.</string>
  <string id="6041585">The mages aren't the problem, Meredith is.</string>
  <string id="6041588">This isn't going to end well. If I were you, I'd stay out of range.</string>
  <string id="6041589">Get out of here.</string>
  <string id="6041648">Hightown Store (Hunter and Hunted)</string>
  <string id="6041652">Corthwaite's Boutique</string>
  <string id="6041685">You went too far when you targeted my people.</string>
  <string id="6041686">I'm going to kill you.</string>
  <string id="6041687">I had nothing to do with that, I swear!</string>
  <string id="6041690">You can still save your friend! The Wounded Coast—we use the ruins there as a base. That's where they were going.</string>
  <string id="6041693">Don't hurt me...</string>
  <string id="6041694">Get out of here.</string>
  <string id="6041695">I don't like his methods, but I respect the goal.</string>
  <string id="6041696">Get out of here.</string>
  <string id="6041697">Don't kill him. Thrask is the one behind this.</string>
  <string id="6041698">Get out of here.</string>
  <string id="6041699">I'll kill anyone who tries using one of us against you.</string>
  <string id="6041700">Get out of here.</string>
  <string id="6041702">Say your prayers, Keran.</string>
  <string id="6041703">Aaah!</string>
  <string id="6041704">I'm not getting involved in this. Let the templars decide what to do with you.</string>
  <string id="6041705">I'm turning you in.</string>
  <string id="6041706">No, please! If Meredith learns about this, she'll kill us. She'll kill every mage, even if they weren't involved.</string>
  <string id="6041709">Your... your friend is on the Wounded Coast. We use the ruins there as a base.</string>
  <string id="6041712">Go to the ruin. Talk to Thrask. Maybe he can convince you we're in the right.</string>
  <string id="6041715">Meredith should hear about this. </string>
  <string id="6041718">As a general rule, I don't trust anyone who uses my friends against me.</string>
  <string id="6041721">Turn him in! If I wasn't with you, that might have been me trussed up in that ruin!</string>
  <string id="6041724">I-I'll go back to Macha's. Please don't tell Meredith about me. It would kill Macha if I got in trouble.</string>
  <string id="6041734">Thank you. I'm really sorry you were the one.</string>
  <string id="6041737">Your friend should be fine. They were going to our base on the Wounded Coast. The ruins there.</string>
  <string id="6041740">I'll go to Macha—try to wait this out. I don't think I can serve the templars while Meredith is still in charge.</string>
  <string id="6041741">I have all the information I require for now.</string>
  <string id="6041742">That's enough.</string>
  <string id="6041747">Good luck on your search, Champion of Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6041750">Greetings again. Do you require more information on the suspects?</string>
  <string id="6041763">Oh! Greetings, messere!</string>
  <string id="6041766">My mistress is away, seeing to a customer, but she will be back shortly.</string>
  <string id="6041769">I can take your measurements, if you wish to have a dress made.</string>
  <string id="6041770">Is there anything I can do to help you?</string>
  <string id="6041779">Groans</string>
  <string id="6041782">Many thanks, my friend.</string>
  <string id="6041785">The others? Surely they cannot all be...</string>
  <string id="6041788">Andraste's grace!</string>
  <string id="6041800">Gone. I told them to run...</string>
  <string id="6041812">It figures I'd find you in the middle of this, Brother.</string>
  <string id="6041815">It figures I'd find you in the middle of this, Sister.</string>
  <string id="6041825">She's the knight-commander. This is her province more than anyone's.</string>
  <string id="6041826">We follow Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6041827">Sighs It appears I am outnumbered.</string>
  <string id="6041830">This simplifies things.</string>
  <string id="6041833">Let's go. We need to find out what the Qunari are doing at the Keep.</string>
  <string id="6041834">I say we let the first enchanter guide us.</string>
  <string id="6041835">We follow Orsino.</string>
  <string id="6041836">Or saves us from them. Thank you, I shall do my best.</string>
  <string id="6041839">I won't have you two at each other's throats. I'm in charge.</string>
  <string id="6041840">I will lead us.</string>
  <string id="6041847">Let's see what the Qunari are doing at the Keep, shall we?</string>
  <string id="6041848">Tell us, then: what is our course of action?</string>
  <string id="6041849">We need to find out why they're gathering hostages.</string>
  <string id="6041850">Let's get to the Keep.</string>
  <string id="6041851">Let's find out what the Qunari are planning, but not risk our necks in the process.</string>
  <string id="6041852">We need to be careful.</string>
  <string id="6041853">I take it running for the hills isn't an option?</string>
  <string id="6041854">Not get killed?</string>
  <string id="6041855">An excellent choice. Let's move quickly.</string>
  <string id="6041859">Do I look like I need a dress?</string>
  <string id="6041860">Don't be ridiculous.</string>
  <string id="6041861">I... I didn't mean to offend, messere. Forgive me!</string>
  <string id="6041904">Orsino, make sure there are no surprises.</string>
  <string id="6041909">We'll need to get you inside and catch up as soon as we can.</string>
  <string id="6041943">Perhaps it is best if you wait for my mistress.</string>
  <string id="6041944">You could tell me about your husband, Huon. That would be helpful.</string>
  <string id="6041945">You could talk.</string>
  <string id="6041946">You're an elf. Any relation to Huon, the mage?</string>
  <string id="6041947">You know Huon?</string>
  <string id="6041948">Ghyslain de Carrac</string>
  <string id="6041950">I'm here to speak to Huon's wife. Are you she?</string>
  <string id="6041951">I'm not here for that.</string>
  <string id="6041954">Warehouse (Hunter and Hunted)</string>
  <string id="6041956">I just wanted to talk.</string>
  <string id="6041959">I'll only wear dresses that are absolutely festooned with ruffles.</string>
  <string id="6041960">Can you make ruffles?</string>
  <string id="6041961">I... er... perhaps you should wait to speak to my mistress.</string>
  <string id="6041969">I... I am his wife.</string>
  <string id="6041981">When the templars found out he was a mage, they chained him and dragged him from the alienage. In front of everyone.</string>
  <string id="6041984">Now I'm trapped in this... this sham. Married, but with no husband, and no future.</string>
  <string id="6042003">This was a damned round-about way of trying to kill me.</string>
  <string id="6042004">You wanted me dead!</string>
  <string id="6042005">Do you really think yourself so important?</string>
  <string id="6042021">But after they left, he... he came to me. He wanted me to hide him.</string>
  <string id="6042024">I used to dream of him returning. But not like this. He's changed, and I don't know him anymore. I sent him away.</string>
  <string id="6042030">Well, here you are. You've been sticking your nose in every problem in Kirkwall since you stumbled off the boat.</string>
  <string id="6042034">Who are you, again?</string>
  <string id="6042035">Do I know you?</string>
  <string id="6042036">Samson. I'm the one who fouled up your lad Feynriel's escape, some years ago.</string>
  <string id="6042039">Further back, I was a templar. But that was before your time.</string>
  <string id="6042040">Are you part of this plot against Meredith?</string>
  <string id="6042041">What are you doing here?</string>
  <string id="6042045">You could say so. That bitch threw me out of the templars for carrying letters from a mageling to his sweetheart.</string>
  <string id="6042048">She's got her sword so far up her ass, she can cut you with her tongue.</string>
  <string id="6042049">Shouldn't you be in with the rest of them?</string>
  <string id="6042050">Then why are you out here?</string>
  <string id="6042051">You were the upstanding citizen begging coins to get your next flask of lyrium.</string>
  <string id="6042052">I remember you.</string>
  <string id="6042053">It's a long time since anyone could get under my skin with that. I know what I am.</string>
  <string id="6042056">So it shouldn't surprise you to see me here, right? One more blockhead move that's gonna keep me in the gutter.</string>
  <string id="6042059">I just wanted to see Meredith out on her ass, like she did to me.</string>
  <string id="6042060">I'm looking for Thrask.</string>
  <string id="6042061">Get out of my way.</string>
  <string id="6042062">You don't sound happy. Last I heard, you two were close.</string>
  <string id="6042065">So were we, once. Of course, that was before Meredith kicked me out of the templars.</string>
  <string id="6042068">Thrask knew she was a bitch then, but he still thought he could change things from the inside. I hoped he would.</string>
  <string id="6042069">It sounds like you've had a change of heart.</string>
  <string id="6042070">But now?</string>
  <string id="6042074">Meredith does seem to have a serious case of the crazies, yes.</string>
  <string id="6042075">She is a bit unstable.</string>
  <string id="6042076">But is she wrong?</string>
  <string id="6042079">Secret night-time meetings and grandiose conspiracies aren't going to win this.</string>
  <string id="6042080">This isn't the right way.</string>
  <string id="6042081">Truth. This whole thing's done wrong.</string>
  <string id="6042084">I'd hoped with Meredith gone, I could take up the shield again. But maybe she was right—give them a hint of freedom, mages go bad.</string>
  <string id="6042088">Your friends are right. Without Meredith, Kirkwall can be at peace again.</string>
  <string id="6042089">I want to help the mages.</string>
  <string id="6042090">I hope so.</string>
  <string id="6042093">I'd cheer to see her shipped to Val Royeaux.</string>
  <string id="6042096">But I don't have the stomach to turn against all that's right and natural to do it.</string>
  <string id="6042097">Every mage seems willing to use blood magic in the name of freedom. They can't be trusted.</string>
  <string id="6042098">The mages must be stopped.</string>
  <string id="6042099">Much as I hate it, I think you're right.</string>
  <string id="6042102">And Meredith's lost more people to this movement than she knows. She needs men she can trust.</string>
  <string id="6042105">If you go after Thrask, I'll gather the templars I know who are still loyal. Maybe I can earn my shield back after all.</string>
  <string id="6042120">How has Huon changed?</string>
  <string id="6042121">Changed?</string>
  <string id="6042122">Did he hurt you?</string>
  <string id="6042123">Are you all right?</string>
  <string id="6042127">Do you know where Huon went after you sent him away?</string>
  <string id="6042128">Where is Huon now?</string>
  <string id="6042132">If such a plot existed, if the Qunari had murdered you for trying to help their slave mage, then yes, someone might have found that useful.</string>
  <string id="6042135">It would have cast doubt on appeasement. Perhaps your death would have been a tragic necessity.</string>
  <string id="6042138">Perhaps finding the mage was a rushed opportunity. But all we have now are dead Qunari and the word of a sympathizer.</string>
  <string id="6042139">I won't forget this, Sister.</string>
  <string id="6042140">You've made an enemy.</string>
  <string id="6042141">Take your coin. Disappear back into Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6042144">Rest assured I will not make the mistake of looking for help outside the faithful again.</string>
  <string id="6042147">The stakes—eternity—are just too high.</string>
  <string id="6042148">I have no allegiance to Qunari. You lost a potential ally.</string>
  <string id="6042149">We could have been allies.</string>
  <string id="6042150">Perhaps, but I will not risk these kinds of relationships again. Take your pay and be gone.</string>
  <string id="6042153">I am new to this, I admit, but someone has to think of eternity.</string>
  <string id="6042156">The peace will not last.</string>
  <string id="6042199">You know it wasn't.</string>
  <string id="6042202">Mind your tongue, Fereldan.</string>
  <string id="6042205">Please. Do speak your mind.</string>
  <string id="6042206">Don't string me along. You know that I know.</string>
  <string id="6042207">Don't play games.</string>
  <string id="6042208">Whether you believe it or not, I wished you no harm. That might have been useful for someone, but still regrettable.</string>
  <string id="6042211">I assumed he wanted to escape, just as I would. My pity is genuine, but they are not like us.</string>
  <string id="6042215">He was obsessed with showing everyone true elven power. He frightened me.</string>
  <string id="6042218">I don't know. He... disappeared.</string>
  <string id="6042221">I don't know what he means, and I am afraid of him, messere.</string>
  <string id="6042224">A massacre of citizens protecting a slave might have forced the Chantry to doubt appeasement, to see the Qunari for the monsters they are.</string>
  <string id="6042227">Perhaps finding the mage was a rushed opportunity. If such a plot existed, I see how it might be... disagreeable to you.</string>
  <string id="6042232">Only broke my heart.</string>
  <string id="6042233">Did you see him use any magic? Perhaps blood magic?</string>
  <string id="6042234">Is Huon a blood mage?</string>
  <string id="6042235">I... I don't know. I don't think he used magic on me.</string>
  <string id="6042243">I think you know it wasn't without incident.</string>
  <string id="6042246">Without bloody incident? You know better.</string>
  <string id="6042249">Mind your tongue, woman.</string>
  <string id="6042252">I think the incident was rather your idea.</string>
  <string id="6042255">Mind your tongue, dwarf.</string>
  <string id="6042258">You know what we faced.</string>
  <string id="6042261">Don't pretend. You know what we faced.</string>
  <string id="6042264">Without incident, she says. Really?</string>
  <string id="6042267">This matter was your doing from the start.</string>
  <string id="6042270">Don't be like that. You know we know.</string>
  <string id="6042273">Mind your tongue, elf.</string>
  <string id="6042280">Your Ketojan killed himself rather than be free.</string>
  <string id="6042281">The mage is dead. Do you care?</string>
  <string id="6042283">Your Ketojan chose to go back and be killed rather than be free.</string>
  <string id="6042284">The mage is dead. Do you care?</string>
  <string id="6042287">If? Perhaps? Why dance around this lie? I'm standing right here.</string>
  <string id="6042288">You dodge and deny even now.</string>
  <string id="6042289">But an accusation from a Lowtown thug... You are hardly that important.</string>
  <string id="6042290">You risked my life. Perhaps I should return the favor.</string>
  <string id="6042291">I should kill you.</string>
  <string id="6042292">No doubt you would prove a challenge for my guard, but I will not offer the chance today. Violence here serves no purpose.</string>
  <string id="6042295">I accept the grim necessities of standing in the Maker's name, but I will not waste his gifts.</string>
  <string id="6042298">You did better than you were asked. I will honor that arrangement. We will have nothing more to do with each other.</string>
  <string id="6042299">If someone saw an opportunity in the mage, if the Qunari murdered those who tried to help it, yes, that might be useful.</string>
  <string id="6042302">The Chantry must see the Qunari as the monsters they are. If someone ushers that along, some sacrifices are justified.</string>
  <string id="6042305">If a member of the Chantry admitted instigation, I have no doubt it would result in more appeasement.</string>
  <string id="6042310">That's not an insult—it's why I chose you. Rest assured, excuses, real or imagined, are not for your benefit.</string>
  <string id="6042317">You will not conquer this city without a fight!</string>
  <string id="6042323">Saarebas! Vinek kathas!</string>
  <string id="6042329">Greetings, invaders.</string>
  <string id="6042350">Here is your viscount.</string>
  <string id="6042364">Would it help if I returned? I'll make sure you're safe.</string>
  <string id="6042365">I could protect you.</string>
  <string id="6042366">I'll deal with him next time he shows up.</string>
  <string id="6042367">When is he returning?</string>
  <string id="6042368">Don't worry. He probably means to carry you off into the moonlight on the back of a horse.</string>
  <string id="6042369">It's probably nothing.</string>
  <string id="6042373">I suppose it was too much to hope that you wouldn't have come here.</string>
  <string id="6042387">I think whatever he is planning is much more sinister.</string>
  <string id="6042388">By the Stone, please... stop Bartrand.</string>
  <string id="6042394">Templar</string>
  <string id="6042396">Tell Bartrand that there's a way around the collapsed main passage.</string>
  <string id="6042397">Explore the strange thaig to see what secrets it holds.</string>
  <string id="6042399">You should have gone to the templars immediately!</string>
  <string id="6042400">You didn't tell anyone?</string>
  <string id="6042401">I... I didn't think. You're right, I should have.</string>
  <string id="6042406">B-but Huon said he would return to take me away from this forever.</string>
  <string id="6042407">I... would be grateful.</string>
  <string id="6042408">Who else has been screwing me over? Tell me, you rutting mongrel!</string>
  <string id="6042429">Huon said he would come to the alienage soon, at nightfall.</string>
  <string id="6042434">Lyrium Idol</string>
  <string id="6042438">Damn you lot—I thought you were competent!</string>
  <string id="6042439">What's it cost to get a decent blade at your back!</string>
  <string id="6042440">Protect me! Do your job!</string>
  <string id="6042450">But, for all your might, you are no different from these bas. You do not see.</string>
  <string id="6042459">Maraas toh ebra-shok. You alone are basalit-an.</string>
  <string id="6042474">So tell me, Hawke: you know I cannot withdraw. How would you resolve this conflict?</string>
  <string id="6042475">Isabela stole the Tome of Koslun. We find her and you can leave Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6042476">By returning the book.</string>
  <string id="6042477">And is this not one of your companions? One I suspect you aided.</string>
  <string id="6042483">There's only one way this ends.</string>
  <string id="6042484">On the battlefield.</string>
  <string id="6042485">I agree.</string>
  <string id="6042488">There must be a way to sort this out without killing each other.</string>
  <string id="6042489">We can work this out.</string>
  <string id="6042490">The time for words has passed.</string>
  <string id="6042493">Let's talk this over. Maybe one day we'll look back on this and laugh.</string>
  <string id="6042494">Can't we be friends?</string>
  <string id="6042495">I think not.</string>
  <string id="6042501">Arishokost! Qun-anaam ebra-toh.</string>
  <string id="6042508">To the death, Arishok.</string>
  <string id="6042509">I agree.</string>
  <string id="6042510">Meravas! So shall it be!</string>
  <string id="6042516">There's no way I will agree to that.</string>
  <string id="6042517">I refuse.</string>
  <string id="6042519">The demand of the Qun is clear, as it always is.</string>
  <string id="6042524">He... he said he needed to make preparations. He said he would come soon, at nightfall.</string>
  <string id="6042527">And please, messere, I beg you, don't hurt him. He's still my husband. </string>
  <string id="6042533">Maybe the Circle will be able to heal whatever troubles him.</string>
  <string id="6042545">You though, you're what a man needs—a skilled enthusiast.</string>
  <string id="6042546">There a job in this rambling?</string>
  <string id="6042547">Get to the offer.</string>
  <string id="6042550">You can start making sense any time now.</string>
  <string id="6042551">What are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="6042561">He's been forcing them to eat lyrium. Some of the servants, he... cut pieces off them while they were still alive.</string>
  <string id="6042562">I don't know what Bartrand did to them. By the Ancestors, the sounds coming from his study...</string>
  <string id="6042563">Thank you. Maybe there's no one left alive in there, but if there is... grant them a quick end.</string>
  <string id="6042564">I wish I believed that, human.</string>
  <string id="6042565">He's hearing things... seeing things... talking to someone who's not there. That's when he's feeling good.</string>
  <string id="6042571">She was so beautiful.</string>
  <string id="6042572">She was your wife!</string>
  <string id="6042573">How could you?</string>
  <string id="6042574">Someday, I'd like to go one week without meeting an insane mage. Just one week.</string>
  <string id="6042575">Not again.</string>
  <string id="6042577">Dear Player,&#13;
&#13;
I need you to go talk to some scoundrel named Lilley the Knife in Darktown. He is trying to extort money from me. And I don't want to pay him.&#13;
&#13;
Hubert.</string>
  <string id="6042578">Dear Player,&#13;
&#13;
Meet me in the Undercity. I have a business proposition for you.&#13;
&#13;
A.</string>
  <string id="6042580">Jethann</string>
  <string id="6042635">I believe I can answer that.</string>
  <string id="6042641">The Tome of Koslun.</string>
  <string id="6042644">I'm sure you'll find it's mostly undamaged.</string>
  <string id="6042673">Primeval Thaig</string>
  <string id="6042678">Find another way out of the dwarven crypt.</string>
  <string id="6042681">I've been hiding in here, but the guards... they're like crazed animals. I didn't dare go past them. Everyone in this house has gone mad!</string>
  <string id="6042684">He says he's trying to help them hear the song. Please, stop him.</string>
  <string id="6042687">They're dead by now. I hope.</string>
  <string id="6042688">Her sacrifice will lead me to my destiny.</string>
  <string id="6042691">The humans keep us down because they're afraid of the magic within us.</string>
  <string id="6042694">Look at the magic Nyssa held inside her. She was just afraid to use it.</string>
  <string id="6042703">You're going to pay for what you did.</string>
  <string id="6042704">You won't get away.</string>
  <string id="6042705">I am a visionary. I've seen our destiny. I know what fate holds for the elves.</string>
  <string id="6042708">Groans</string>
  <string id="6042726">Bartrand took the servants and locked himself inside the study. No one's come out for days.</string>
  <string id="6042727">Your mess just picked me up on the way by.</string>
  <string id="6042728">I was attacked. I responded.</string>
  <string id="6042729">My manners! Javaris Tintop, merchant and investor. I need forward thinkers to help court the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6042736">Oh! The Champion of Kirkwall! This is marvelous. You honor this household.</string>
  <string id="6042742">I will call for refreshments.</string>
  <string id="6042751">Talia!</string>
  <string id="6042754">Sighs She is so slow, this girl. Come, let us chat while we wait.</string>
  <string id="6042755">Runaway mages resorting to blood magic. How very original.</string>
  <string id="6042756">So, they're using blood magic.</string>
  <string id="6042759">You haven't seen the last of me, Hawke!</string>
  <string id="6042762">The Qunari have what we came for. We will go.</string>
  <string id="6042765">But know this: one day we shall return.</string>
  <string id="6042774">One day, we shall return.</string>
  <string id="6042777">Gasps</string>
  <string id="6042788">We shall return.</string>
  <string id="6042789">Screams</string>
  <string id="6042791">Groans</string>
  <string id="6042794">You're extremely cheery for a woman whose son is wanted by the templars.</string>
  <string id="6042795">You're in fine spirits.</string>
  <string id="6042798">Then we go in after him. Come on, Hawke. Let's finish this.</string>
  <string id="6042801">Bartrand's not exactly a nice guy, but... this doesn't sound like my brother.</string>
  <string id="6042804">What do you mean you hope they're dead?</string>
  <string id="6042805">Thank you for your hospitality, Comtesse. I need to speak to you about Emile.</string>
  <string id="6042806">You are a gracious host.</string>
  <string id="6042807">This is not a social call. I'm here about your son, Emile.</string>
  <string id="6042808">Stop fussing!</string>
  <string id="6042809">Name is Javaris Tintop, and I need someone to help me court the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6042827">Problem being, I'm no warrior. But I can pay.</string>
  <string id="6042831">Your people must have something like that already.</string>
  <string id="6042832">Dwarves don't have explosives?</string>
  <string id="6042833">What's the point when we already have magic that can do the same thing?</string>
  <string id="6042834">But magic already does this.</string>
  <string id="6042837">All right, I'll step in for you. For a price.</string>
  <string id="6042838">I'm in if the coin is good.</string>
  <string id="6042839">Sounds like you've made a bargain you can't keep.</string>
  <string id="6042840">Your plan seems a little weak.</string>
  <string id="6042841">Still better than what I had. Look, the name's Javaris Tintop. I need someone to help pacify the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6042848">The Starkhaven mages are here, without bloodshed. I wish it felt like more of a victory...</string>
  <string id="6042852">You have kept my secret well. No one in the Order knows I stood by while our own were murdered.</string>
  <string id="6042856">I can't believe you killed those mages. If I had wished that, I would have asked Karras directly.</string>
  <string id="6042859">Just... whoever... whatever you find in that room, Varric, give them a merciful death.</string>
  <string id="6042865">I can't... I can't... hear it anymore. I just need to hear the song again... just for a minute...</string>
  <string id="6042878">Those horn-heads in Kirkwall have a powder. That explodes. And it's just dust, no lyrium, no demons. Anyone can use it.</string>
  <string id="6042884">If it is magic, it's a kind you can assemble, and dwarves do that very well.</string>
  <string id="6042887">Stop saying that! I know I shouldn't have sold the idol to that woman! It was a mistake! A mistake...</string>
  <string id="6042890">Docks</string>
  <string id="6042895">Arthuris's Private Dock</string>
  <string id="6042902">Emile? Oh, yes! The templars were asking about our poor boy recently.</string>
  <string id="6042905">Hospitality? This? Oh, it is a disgrace. If you had just sent a message to say you were coming!</string>
  <string id="6042914">You can tell the templars not to worry. I'm sure Emile will turn himself in soon. He's a good boy.</string>
  <string id="6042917">I haven't seen Emile since he was taken to the Circle. He was just six.</string>
  <string id="6042938">Bloody flames! What were those things?</string>
  <string id="6042947">Emeric</string>
  <string id="6042962">Rock Wraith Abomination</string>
  <string id="6042970">Dulci!</string>
  <string id="6042972">Find the crypt's vault and destroy its guardian.</string>
  <string id="6042975">I have heard of this. It's why their ships are so feared.</string>
  <string id="6042976">I've felt its sting. Their ships fire thunder.</string>
  <string id="6042977">I often look at every second idiot and think he needs more power. </string>
  <string id="6042978">Fools with swords are bad enough, but this?</string>
  <string id="6042979">A mage's power... in anyone's hand?</string>
  <string id="6042980">Available to any idiot? That would be mad.</string>
  <string id="6042981">The Qunari use it sparingly. Released to everyone, I could not imagine the chaos.</string>
  <string id="6042982">No demons, and anyone can use it? Curious...</string>
  <string id="6042983">Ever see one of their ships belch at full strength? Like powdered dragon.</string>
  <string id="6042986">I doubt they were eager to sell.</string>
  <string id="6042987">They offered this to you?</string>
  <string id="6042988">So it's some kind of Qunari magic. What use is that to a dwarf?</string>
  <string id="6042989">It sounds like magic.</string>
  <string id="6042992">But that Arishok, he won't deal. Said I have the same mercenary disease as their outcasts—the Tal-Vashoth?</string>
  <string id="6042995">And you're going to prove yourself by killing Tal-Vashoth outlaws.</string>
  <string id="6043007">What have you done? You should have told the boy to throw himself at the mercy of the templars!</string>
  <string id="6043010">Guillaume, darling...</string>
  <string id="6043013">Don't darling me, Dulci! He's been telling people he's our son, that you gave him gold!</string>
  <string id="6043016">Guillaume, darling... we have guests!</string>
  <string id="6043019">Varric! You'll help me, won't you, little brother? Help me find it again? You were always the good one... </string>
  <string id="6043020">Don't stop on my account, this is fascinating.</string>
  <string id="6043021">Do continue!</string>
  <string id="6043024">Bartrand, get ahold of yourself! Do you know where you are? Do you know what you've done?</string>
  <string id="6043027">Help you? Bartrand, you left me to die! You left all your men to die! And for what? Some trinket?</string>
  <string id="6043028">Enemies Among Us</string>
  <string id="6043029">Speak with the templar recruits in the Gallows Courtyard to find out what happened to Keran.</string>
  <string id="6043033">Please find Keran, good ser. I fear terribly what the templars have done to him.</string>
  <string id="6043048">Look at yourself! Look at what you've done to the men and women who served you! Where's your nobility, Brother? Where's your dwarven honor?</string>
  <string id="6043049">The abomination is dead. Find another way out of the crypt.</string>
  <string id="6043051">He says I'm not worthy, but he had this look in his eye, so I figure I'll hire some blades and...</string>
  <string id="6043057">Templar's Hall</string>
  <string id="6043063">You might as well be talking to the wall. His mind is gone.</string>
  <string id="6043064">You're wasting your breath.</string>
  <string id="6043065">You've already beaten him. Don't lose your head.</string>
  <string id="6043066">Take it easy, Varric.</string>
  <string id="6043067">He doesn't look so good. I'm not sure he even knows we're here.</string>
  <string id="6043068">I don't think he can hear you.</string>
  <string id="6043075">Anders? Can you do something?</string>
  <string id="6043078">Templar Recruit Hugh</string>
  <string id="6043080">This doesn't feel natural. If he wasn't a dwarf, I'd think a demon did this. His mind has been... poisoned by something powerful.</string>
  <string id="6043086">That's all I can do. It won't last. I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6043087">Look for Knight-Captain Cullen and Wilmod in Wilmod's Camp outside Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6043093">Recruits aren't allowed to speak to visitors, messere.</string>
  <string id="6043096">If you want something, talk to the knights.</string>
  <string id="6043100">So now we have to earn our way into the city? How hard can that be?</string>
  <string id="6043104">Wesley would have been horrified to see this.</string>
  <string id="6043136">Varric?</string>
  <string id="6043141">I'm here.</string>
  <string id="6043144">Varric, what have I done?</string>
  <string id="6043148">Is it over?</string>
  <string id="6043151">It's over.</string>
  <string id="6043154">The city has been saved!</string>
  <string id="6043163">Well done. It appears Kirkwall has a new champion.</string>
  <string id="6043171">I don't know. I honestly don't know.</string>
  <string id="6043174">Make it stop, little brother. Don't let me... don't let House Tethras fall like this.</string>
  <string id="6043177">Bartrand, you know I don't give a rat's ass about your Noble Caste honor.</string>
  <string id="6043181">You seem confused, Seeker.</string>
  <string id="6043226">Small things, shaped to crack faults, not shatter the earth. Plus they're mostly lyrium.</string>
  <string id="6043230">Maybe you have magic, all tough and human and what not. But what of the common man?</string>
  <string id="6043233">How does he remove stumps from his land, or produce them on his enemies? What does he do when he needs a hole far too fast?</string>
  <string id="6043236">Magic is hard to market. But this stuff... this stuff you can put in a bag.</string>
  <string id="6043239">Honor? I left my honor at the gates of Orzammar. But you... looking after Mother, the business, me... they didn't take it from you.</string>
  <string id="6043245">I know... I don't deserve it. But please, Varric... don't leave me like this. Make it stop.</string>
  <string id="6043249">I gave him some money. Not too much. He said he wanted to start a new life.</string>
  <string id="6043252">I didn't mean to lie to you, Champion! I... I barely saw Emile, I didn't think it was worth mentioning!</string>
  <string id="6043255">I am your son's best chance for mercy from the templars.</string>
  <string id="6043256">I can help Emile.</string>
  <string id="6043257">Mercy? They wouldn't really hurt him, would they? Oh, you should've seen his face—it just broke my heart!</string>
  <string id="6043260">I'll only ask this once: where is Emile?</string>
  <string id="6043261">You have one chance.</string>
  <string id="6043262">You won't find him! I gave him enough money to start a new life, away from these templars.</string>
  <string id="6043265">New life? His new life is spent in Lowtown taverns, getting drunk on cheap wine. It's a wonder the templars haven't found him yet.</string>
  <string id="6043275">Damn you, Bartrand! Tell me!</string>
  <string id="6043276">I just... I want to know why.</string>
  <string id="6043277">I didn't come here just to leave without telling my brother he's a filthy nug-licker and demanding some answers!</string>
  <string id="6043278">He's not worth your sympathy. Kill the bastard.</string>
  <string id="6043279">Put him out of his misery.</string>
  <string id="6043280">Varric, he's not going to be fine. You know that.</string>
  <string id="6043281">Put him out of his misery.</string>
  <string id="6043282">Seriously? Three years of I'm going to skin him alive, and then poof, best buddies?</string>
  <string id="6043283">Put him out of his misery.</string>
  <string id="6043284">Enough chatter. Grab him, and let's go.</string>
  <string id="6043285">Let's get him out of here.</string>
  <string id="6043286">I doubt that staying in this house is helping his condition.</string>
  <string id="6043287">Let's get him out of here.</string>
  <string id="6043288">We can probably carry him. You want to take his arms while I take his legs?</string>
  <string id="6043289">Let's get him out of here.</string>
  <string id="6043292">Expensive, poisonous, the Chantry controls it topside, the glow makes you a target: problem after problem.</string>
  <string id="6043322">Hawke, you once aided me in a time of need. I must impose on you yet again.</string>
  <string id="6043325">Emile is not a blood mage, just a foolish boy. Don't let the templars kill him.</string>
  <string id="6043326">Help us, please, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6043327">Champion, I did not expose your criminal past when you rose to fame. You owe me now.</string>
  <string id="6043330">Blood mage? Oh, Guillaume, don't say that!</string>
  <string id="6043338">I suppose there could be a reward for these Tal-Vashoth.</string>
  <string id="6043339">I'd do it to hunt outlaws.</string>
  <string id="6043357">If there is a way to help Emile, I will find it.</string>
  <string id="6043358">I'll do what I can.</string>
  <string id="6043359">Thank you, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6043362">Come, Dulci. Perhaps you should lie down.</string>
  <string id="6043365">It may be too late for Emile.</string>
  <string id="6043366">Don't get your hopes up.</string>
  <string id="6043367">Too... too late? What does that mean, Guillaume? Is Emile dead? Oh...</string>
  <string id="6043380">Please, save my son's life.</string>
  <string id="6043381">No, no, no! He's not dead. In fact, someone saw him at the Hanged Man not two hours ago.</string>
  <string id="6043385">I guess there's nothing he could say that would make it right.</string>
  <string id="6043386">He has to pay for what he's done.</string>
  <string id="6043387">Kill him.</string>
  <string id="6043388">He's beyond any healer's skill. Make it quick and end his suffering.</string>
  <string id="6043389">Kill him.</string>
  <string id="6043390">Let's finish what we came here for, Varric.</string>
  <string id="6043391">Kill him.</string>
  <string id="6043392">You don't want your brother's blood on your hands.</string>
  <string id="6043393">Let him go.</string>
  <string id="6043394">You don't want to do this, Varric. You're not the sort of man who'd kill his own brother.</string>
  <string id="6043395">Let him go.</string>
  <string id="6043396">Look at him. There's nothing you can do to him worse than this.</string>
  <string id="6043397">Let him go.</string>
  <string id="6043399">The Hanged Man? Oh, but that place is filthy!</string>
  <string id="6043402">An acquaintance spied Emile in the Hanged Man not long ago. He should still be there.</string>
  <string id="6043408">It looks like the comtesse is in greater danger of expiring at the moment.</string>
  <string id="6043409">What about the comtesse?</string>
  <string id="6043410">Yes, Dulci... she's... er, high-strung.</string>
  <string id="6043426">Lowtown</string>
  <string id="6043453">Wow. Are you... are you a mage? Because you just magicked my breath away.</string>
  <string id="6043454">As a matter of fact, I am a mage.</string>
  <string id="6043455">I am.</string>
  <string id="6043456">So am I. Some people say I'm a blood mage. I'm dangerous. I bet you like danger, don't you?</string>
  <string id="6043462">Did he just tell a stranger he was a blood mage? Even I wouldn't do that!</string>
  <string id="6043463">I need a bath after hearing that.</string>
  <string id="6043464">Ugh.</string>
  <string id="6043473">Gamlen's House</string>
  <string id="6043485">Enough with the speeches! I'll get you to a healer, and you'll be fine.</string>
  <string id="6043488">Docks</string>
  <string id="6043495">The comte was right. How did the templars miss him?</string>
  <string id="6043498">This is what lack of sex does to a person. I can only watch in horror.</string>
  <string id="6043501">He's lived in the Circle all his life. He can't function in the real world. </string>
  <string id="6043502">This man-child has evaded the templars? Crime of the century.</string>
  <string id="6043503">The fool doesn't understand how to lay low.</string>
  <string id="6043508">Something on your mind, Varric?</string>
  <string id="6043514">Though I can't understand why you side with Meredith now. You showed me we can stand up to her.</string>
  <string id="6043517">When you fought off Karras's thugs to save those mages...</string>
  <string id="6043520">When I realized you had risked your life lying to protect those mages...</string>
  <string id="6043523">When you took Feynriel to the Dalish and insisted there was another way...</string>
  <string id="6043526">Though I cannot understand why you support Meredith still.</string>
  <string id="6043529">It was not the Circle that kept Feynriel safe from demons. It was you.</string>
  <string id="6043532">These mages you sent back with Karras have been treated like prisoners, starved and beaten!</string>
  <string id="6043535">Please, Champion. I have nothing but respect for you. It's Meredith we must see gone.</string>
  <string id="6043536">I will not negotiate until you unhand Bethany.</string>
  <string id="6043537">Release my sister!</string>
  <string id="6043538">No harm will come to your sister.</string>
  <string id="6043541">I will not negotiate until Carver is standing beside me.</string>
  <string id="6043542">Release my brother!</string>
  <string id="6043543">I will not harm your brother.</string>
  <string id="6043546">I will not negotiate while my friend lies drugged on the floor!</string>
  <string id="6043547">Release your hostage!</string>
  <string id="6043551">We will release him the moment I have your word that you will support us.</string>
  <string id="6043554">We will release her as soon as I have your word to support us.</string>
  <string id="6043557">Your cause is just. But I take issue with your methods.</string>
  <string id="6043558">I don't support Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6043559">I should have known you recognize the threat Meredith poses. I am sorry for any distress we caused you or your friends.</string>
  <string id="6043560">This is a violent scheme  to overthrow the knight-commander. You're all under arrest.</string>
  <string id="6043561">I'm shutting you down.</string>
  <string id="6043562">Then your sister dies!</string>
  <string id="6043563">Then your brother dies!</string>
  <string id="6043564">Then your friend dies!</string>
  <string id="6043567">We will not kill an innocent to achieve our ends. It gains us nothing to become Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6043568">Wilmod’s Camp</string>
  <string id="6043569">Leave Area</string>
  <string id="6043572">Round of drinks on me? I'm Emile, as you know. And you are...?</string>
  <string id="6043588">Did you need something, Varric?</string>
  <string id="6043591">I should thank you for your help with my brother.</string>
  <string id="6043594">A stiff drink, maybe. I feel like I've been kicked by a horse.</string>
  <string id="6043595">I've made worse deals.</string>
  <string id="6043596">I will do it.</string>
  <string id="6043599">He deserved it after what happened to Bethany, but... I couldn't have gone through with that on my own.</string>
  <string id="6043600">He deserved to die after what happened to Carver, but... I couldn't have gone through with that on my own.</string>
  <string id="6043601">He was a jackass, and he tried to kill us, but... that was still the hardest thing I've ever done.</string>
  <string id="6043602">You need more practice with women.</string>
  <string id="6043603">That was pathetic.</string>
  <string id="6043604">Can I practice on you? Giggles In private?</string>
  <string id="6043605">You're in trouble, Emile. I'm trying to help you out.</string>
  <string id="6043606">We need to talk.</string>
  <string id="6043613">I'll bathe you, if you know what I mean. With my tongue.</string>
  <string id="6043616">That would never work. Your tongue's not raspy enough. At best, you'd just drool a lot.</string>
  <string id="6043619">My name—De Launcet—comes from a part of Orlais famed for its stout lances. You want to see mine?</string>
  <string id="6043622">I don't think she can make him a man. It's entirely a matter of having the right bits to begin with.</string>
  <string id="6043625">Feeling very sorry for you.</string>
  <string id="6043626">Sympathetic.</string>
  <string id="6043627">They call me the Champion of Kirkwall. I've been looking for you, Emile.</string>
  <string id="6043628">I'm Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6043634">Can I kill him yet? He's hurting me.</string>
  <string id="6043635">I'm here to take you back to the Gallows, blood mage.</string>
  <string id="6043636">Going to bring you in.</string>
  <string id="6043645">No! The boy dies. Then the Champion.</string>
  <string id="6043648">No! The girl dies. Then the Champion.</string>
  <string id="6043651">No! The elf dies. Then the Champion.</string>
  <string id="6043654">No! The dwarf dies. Then the Champion.</string>
  <string id="6043657">No! The guard dies. Then the Champion.</string>
  <string id="6043660">No! The traitor dies. Then the Champion.</string>
  <string id="6043669">Meredith! What do I care for Meredith?</string>
  <string id="6043672">I'm here for the Champion.</string>
  <string id="6043673">I'm also helping the templars hunt a mage named Emile de Launcet, and here you are!</string>
  <string id="6043676">Oh, buggery! I know what this is about. I... I'm not a blood mage, all right?</string>
  <string id="6043679">Wait! I... I'm not really a blood mage!</string>
  <string id="6043682">I, uh, started that rumor because... because I thought it would make me sound dangerous and... suave.</string>
  <string id="6043685">Do you have a death wish? You grew up in the Circle, you know what the templars do to blood mages!</string>
  <string id="6043688">I've only told people in the tavern. And only women!</string>
  <string id="6043692">Groans</string>
  <string id="6043698">Isn't it more likely to cause a panic and bring the templars after you?</string>
  <string id="6043701">You don't understand. I've been in the Circle since I was six. Six!</string>
  <string id="6043704">For twenty years I was locked up. Never had a real drink, or... or cooked something for myself.</string>
  <string id="6043707">Never stood in the rain, or kissed a girl...</string>
  <string id="6043710">The Ferelden Circle's more fun. Everyone was kissing everyone.</string>
  <string id="6043713">Though that was before the abominations.</string>
  <string id="6043714">I just wanted to live a little...</string>
  <string id="6043717">Sighs If you're going to kill me, do it. I'd rather die drunk.</string>
  <string id="6043724">You can't run. The templars will find you eventually.</string>
  <string id="6043725">Turn yourself in.</string>
  <string id="6043726">The comtesse gave you the money so you could get out of Kirkwall. Stop wasting it.</string>
  <string id="6043727">I could let you go.</string>
  <string id="6043730">I... I'll make you a deal, all right? Give me one night. Just one night.</string>
  <string id="6043733">One of the tavern girls, Nella, agreed to lie with me. I even paid for a room.</string>
  <string id="6043736">Please... let me have this. You can take me back in chains after.</string>
  <string id="6043737">You're coming with me now.</string>
  <string id="6043738">No.</string>
  <string id="6043739">Say goodnight, Emile.</string>
  <string id="6043758">Would you really risk your life to be with her? She's not even special to you.</string>
  <string id="6043759">That's not a good idea.</string>
  <string id="6043760">She's not too ugly.</string>
  <string id="6043763">The templars may come while you're with her, and believe me, they won't ask questions before they run you through.</string>
  <string id="6043787">Maybe you're right. Maybe it isn't worth it.</string>
  <string id="6043795">Sighs You win. I'll go back to the Circle. This was a stupid idea from the beginning.</string>
  <string id="6043804">I'll wait here till you're ready to go back to the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6043805">It's a deal.</string>
  <string id="6043806">If I see you trying to crawl out a window, you're going to be very, very sorry.</string>
  <string id="6043807">Don't try to escape.</string>
  <string id="6043808">Thank you!</string>
  <string id="6043811">I... I won't.</string>
  <string id="6043823">Well?</string>
  <string id="6043826">I'm not going to tell you about it!</string>
  <string id="6043829">Sighs That was utterly worth it. Back to the templars!</string>
  <string id="6043832">You'll let me go?</string>
  <string id="6043835">I can tell the templars you're dead, but you have to leave now.</string>
  <string id="6043838">I... I think there's a ship leaving port tonight. I'll find my way onto it.</string>
  <string id="6043841">Thank you. I'll find some way to repay you some day, I promise.</string>
  <string id="6043845">That Arishok said I wasn't worthy, that only their outcasts, the Tal-Vashoth, are that mercenary.</string>
  <string id="6043847">Darktown</string>
  <string id="6043852">Darktown</string>
  <string id="6043862">I don't know—maybe I could have found help for him.</string>
  <string id="6043863">He was never what you'd call nice. Or pleasant. Or hygienic. But he was my only brother.</string>
  <string id="6043865">Hey! How'd you know my name? Did Nella tell you?</string>
  <string id="6043868">I gave her my Launcet signet ring in exchange for a kiss, and tonight, she's going to make me a man.</string>
  <string id="6043870">Darktown</string>
  <string id="6043872">Bartrand didn't leave you any choice. You had to kill him.</string>
  <string id="6043873">You did what you had to.</string>
  <string id="6043876">He was obviously suffering. You spared him a lot of misery.</string>
  <string id="6043877">It's for the best.</string>
  <string id="6043884">Look at it this way: You didn't really lose a brother, you gained control of the family businesses.</string>
  <string id="6043885">Only good can come from this.</string>
  <string id="6043890">Go to the brothel in Hightown after sundown to find out how Wilmod became possessed.</string>
  <string id="6043891">Whatever you want, just tell me.</string>
  <string id="6043892">We can work this out.</string>
  <string id="6043893">I've been wondering when you'd come back to bite me in the ass.</string>
  <string id="6043894">I knew I should've killed you.</string>
  <string id="6043895">You hurt my sister, you die.</string>
  <string id="6043896">Don't mess with me.</string>
  <string id="6043897">You hurt my brother, you die.</string>
  <string id="6043898">Don't mess with me.</string>
  <string id="6043899">You hurt my friend, you die.</string>
  <string id="6043900">Don't mess with me.</string>
  <string id="6043901">I would rather die a hundred times than endure one more hour in the Circle!</string>
  <string id="6043904">Decimus was right. There is no way for a mage to live by the Chantry's laws.</string>
  <string id="6043907">You killed the best man I ever met. But I learned all he had to teach.</string>
  <string id="6043910">Alain, kill the hostage.</string>
  <string id="6043912">I thought you turned your back on blood magic when you saw what happened to Decimus.</string>
  <string id="6043913">Why are you doing this, Alain?</string>
  <string id="6043914">Try to do a blood mage a favor...</string>
  <string id="6043915">Alain? But I saved you.</string>
  <string id="6043916">I guess a life of quiet contemplation didn't suit you?</string>
  <string id="6043917">Alain? You're not reformed?</string>
  <string id="6043918">You're dead. All of you.</string>
  <string id="6043919">We're past talking.</string>
  <string id="6043932">Our lad Keran is still missing. I hope he has not met Wilmod's same fate.</string>
  <string id="6043933">I suppose it's a little late to worry now.</string>
  <string id="6043934">I hope you're right.</string>
  <string id="6043938">Sure, I've always wanted to waste my life arguing with the Merchant Guild. That's probably what drove Bartrand crazy in the first place!</string>
  <string id="6043945">I don't know if surface dwarves go back to the Stone, or hang around singing hymns with Andraste, or what.</string>
  <string id="6043948">The Blooming Rose</string>
  <string id="6043953">City Guardsman</string>
  <string id="6043957">I just hope wherever he is now, Bartrand stays out of trouble.</string>
  <string id="6043969">It's not your problem anymore.</string>
  <string id="6043970">It's over.</string>
  <string id="6043971">If you're worried about it, we could ask one of the priests to pray for him.</string>
  <string id="6043972">Want to stop by the chantry?</string>
  <string id="6043973">You think he'll badmouth us to the Maker? Haunt our houses?</string>
  <string id="6043974">What could he possibly do?</string>
  <string id="6043975">I'm done bargain hunting. I want it done right.</string>
  <string id="6043981">As long as you do it, I'm happy.</string>
  <string id="6043984">Now, best I could figure, they're up the Wounded Coast, a whole camp. Take their heads off and meet me at the compound in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6043987">Get this right, and we'll be richly rewarded. Richly!</string>
  <string id="6043988">Ah, no one has vision anymore. All right, I'll go sweet talk a giant by myself.</string>
  <string id="6043991">Ugh, I hate being cod-level with those oxmen. Makes me wish I was stone-blind.</string>
  <string id="6043994">If you happen to find yourself along the Wounded Coast collecting Tal-Vashoth heads, well, I'll be all smiles in their compound.</string>
  <string id="6044001">Find Idunna to see what she knows.</string>
  <string id="6044002">I might be a liability because I had to kill some of the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6044003">I'm a risk. I killed Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6044004">Then this helps both of us. I get a seat at a bargaining table, and you get back in their good graces.</string>
  <string id="6044022">Confront the blood mages at their Darktown sanctuary.</string>
  <string id="6044047">Idunna is dead. Search her room for clues about the blood mages she was working with.</string>
  <string id="6044049">I wouldn't put it past him to get back at us somehow.</string>
  <string id="6044050">I'm pretty sure that any decent priest who prays for Bartrand would burst into flames.</string>
  <string id="6044051">I wouldn't put it past him! He always was the vindictive type.</string>
  <string id="6044052">Please, messere, help me.</string>
  <string id="6044057">If they have them, anyway.</string>
  <string id="6044070">Anyway, thank you. I'll keep looking into who bought that blighted statue. At the very least, they need to be warned about what happened.</string>
  <string id="6044072">I knew you since you was young in Lothering. I knew your mum's family—and your pop, Maker grant him rest.</string>
  <string id="6044075">Messere, please... Don't hurt me.</string>
  <string id="6044095">Demands of the Qun</string>
  <string id="6044137">But, it made me think—maybe he'll bargain if I get rid of something that bothers him more than, well, me.</string>
  <string id="6044166">I almost wish Blondie hadn't wiggled his fingers and cleared Bartrand's head. I liked it better when I just wanted to kill the bastard.</string>
  <string id="6044172">You'd think being left for dead in the Deep Roads would have prepared me for Bartrand going nuts, but it really didn't.</string>
  <string id="6044178">He's the asylum's problem now, not yours.</string>
  <string id="6044179">Get over it.</string>
  <string id="6044182">If I ever had doubts about who was the better brother, they're long gone. You did good.</string>
  <string id="6044183">I'm proud of you.</string>
  <string id="6044188">Look at the bright side: you can spend the rest of your days as a caretaker for a murderous lunatic.</string>
  <string id="6044189">Could be worse.</string>

  <string id="6044281">This isn't right, Grace. The Champion tried to help us.</string>
  <string id="6044284">This isn't right, Grace. Meredith's the one you should hate.</string>
  <string id="6044287">Don't defy me, boy! Without me, you'd be nothing!</string>

  <string id="6044367">I am. I am delegating the matter to an individual uniquely equipped to handle it.</string>
  <string id="6044369">An insurrection. Several of my own templars orchestrated the escape, presumably out of sympathy for the mages.</string>
  <string id="6044372">They turned their backs on their duty and endangered their charges, as well as the city.</string>
  <string id="6044375">Thankfully most who escaped fled to their families and offered no resistance. The last three are proving more... difficult.</string>

  <string id="6044513">I shudder to think what the knight-commander will do when she learns of this blood mage's plot.</string>
  <string id="6044519">We got nothing here you'd want. Get back to Hightown and leave us alone!</string>
  <string id="6044523">I don't know what to say. I owe you everything. What those blood mages wanted to do to me... Shudders</string>
  <string id="6044527">After all my sacrifice, the torture... the templars abandon me! One day, they'll regret it.</string>
  <string id="6044530">You're a little young for blood mage, and I thought Evelina was a girl's name.</string>
  <string id="6044531">I wasn't expecting this.</string>
  <string id="6044532">Does Evelina live here? Why are you here?</string>
  <string id="6044533">Is this Evelina's home?</string>
  <string id="6044534">What are you dirty urchins doing in Evelina's hovel?</string>
  <string id="6044535">Ugh. Squatters.</string>
  <string id="6044541">The templars are growing darker by the day. Keran may hate it, but I am glad he is no longer in their order.</string>
  <string id="6044542">Keran is so happy now. I... I hope the rumors about the templars are just that: rumors.</string>
  <string id="6044561">I'll... deal with Bartrand somehow. Maker, that'll be even more of a joy than it used to be.</string>
  <string id="6044570">Greetings,&#13;
&#13;
I hope this letter finds you well. I've often thought of you in these past three years. Without your kindness, my Feynriel would have been long-since sold to slavers. Instead, he has thrived and begun to master his magic. But now his nightmares have caught up with him, and neither the Keeper nor the first enchanter know how to help. I don't know where else to turn. &#13;
&#13;
Please, come to my home in the alienage. I will be waiting to speak with you. Thank you again for the compassion you have shown Feynriel in the past.&#13;
&#13;
Sincerely yours,&#13;

  <string id="6044600">I tried to stay away from her, you know, after Decimus. But... the Circle here is worse than Starkhaven ever was.</string>
  <string id="6044603">It seemed like hers was the only way out.</string>
  <string id="6044606">I knew she was still alive, but I didn't know Thrask was working with her.</string>
  <string id="6044609">When I saw her today, it brought everything back, everything I saw Decimus do.</string>
  <string id="6044612">I... I'm sorry. Grace used blood magic to hold her. That's the only way I can bring her out. </string>
  <string id="6044615">What happened? The last thing I remember is these templars coming into my quarters.</string>
  <string id="6044616">Coughs Get out of my— What? Where am I?</string>
  <string id="6044617">Well, this is embarrassing. I never thought of myself as a damsel in distress.</string>
  <string id="6044618">Coughs Where... am I? I thought for certain I would end up in the Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6044619">Where are we? I was sure I was going to end up in the hold of a slaver's ship.</string>
  <string id="6044620">I should not have let them take me. I let you down.</string>
  <string id="6044621">I take it those weren't Meredith's men?</string>
  <string id="6044622">You... you templars are a disgrace to your mandate! Kidnapping the captain of the guard!</string>
  <string id="6044623">I promise, I'll never let anything like this happen again.</string>
  <string id="6044624">You're safe now.</string>
  <string id="6044625">I thought you were better than this! A couple of lousy templars and you're down?</string>
  <string id="6044626">I'm surprised at you...</string>
  <string id="6044627">I never found fighting templars to be a good policy in this town.</string>
  <string id="6044630">I had no reason to think they'd turn on me!</string>
  <string id="6044633">They knew better than to send templars. I didn't think one of my own would turn on me.</string>
  <string id="6044636">I understand now why city mages fear them.</string>
  <string id="6044639">Ach. They took me by surprise.</string>
  <string id="6044642">Apparently I am not as invulnerable as I thought.</string>
  <string id="6044645">Bianca was resting.</string>
  <string id="6044648">I've known their best. It is hard to think of templars as the enemy.</string>
  <string id="6044651">These bastards won't be bothering you anymore.</string>
  <string id="6044652">I have avenged this crime.</string>
  <string id="6044653">Thank you. It's good to know you're still looking out for me.</string>
  <string id="6044655">I'm always happy to see your face... but it seems particularly lovely right now.</string>
  <string id="6044656">Thank you. I'm glad my life still has value to you.</string>
  <string id="6044657">Thank you for saving me. You're a better friend to me than I deserve.</string>
  <string id="6044658">When I thought they were going to lock me up, the one thing I knew I could not live without was... you.</string>
  <string id="6044659">Thanks for the save, friend. If you're ever in this spot, I'll do the same for you.</string>
  <string id="6044660">I'd say thank you, but I think my way of talking's better done in private.</string>
  <string id="6044661">Thank you for releasing me. I am... grateful.</string>
  <string id="6044662">Thank you. It... is comforting to know that I have you at my back.</string>
  <string id="6044663">Thanks, Hawke. I owe you one.</string>
  <string id="6044664">Thank you, Hawke. You are one of the few things to be counted on in Kirkwall.</string>

  <string id="6044682">I'm not Evelina. I'm Walter. Evelina was our... friend. She was our mother.</string>

  <string id="6044782">Return to the Surface</string>
  <string id="6044790">Come on. I don't want to look at this place anymore.</string>
  <string id="6044797">Go with Aveline to the Qunari Compound by the Docks. She expects trouble, so finish any pressing business first.</string>
  <string id="6044802">Evelina found us when the darkspawn came, when our parents died. She made sure we got to Kirkwall safely.</string>
  <string id="6044812">You came from Ferelden?</string>
  <string id="6044813">Where are you from?</string>
  <string id="6044814">There is someone waiting at the mansion with important news.</string>
  <string id="6044817">But when she went to join the Circle here, they called her apostate for leaving the tower in Ferelden. They locked her up.</string>
  <string id="6044818">Don't you have any other family?</string>
  <string id="6044819">What about your parents?</string>
  <string id="6044821">Didn't she want to stay free, with you?</string>
  <string id="6044822">Why did she go to the Circle?</string>
  <string id="6044823">Yes. Until we got here, I thought we were the only ones who'd survived.</string>
  <string id="6044824">Everyone died in the Blight. Evelina kept picking us up, new children every day, every one she could save.</string>
  <string id="6044825">She didn't want us to be stuck in Darktown. She wanted to give us a real life.</string>
  <string id="6044828">She thought the Circle would help her. But they just locked her away.</string>
  <string id="6044859">I'll send someone to come get him.</string>
  <string id="6044862">Sit tight, Brother. Help is on the way.</string>
  <string id="6044866">I got here as soon as I... Oh!</string>
  <string id="6044869">They're meeting in here, Ser Cullen— Oh! I guess you didn't get on so well with these mages as you thought?</string>
  <string id="6044872">Champion. Samson never said you were involved in this.</string>
  <string id="6044875">I trust you were here to stop these traitors, not join them?</string>
  <string id="6044880">Hmph. You mean he was one of them, save for a convenient last-minute change of heart.</string>
  <string id="6044883">I'll encourage Meredith to take it easy on him.</string>
  <string id="6044886">Thank you, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6044889">Everyone else here is under arrest. Take them to the Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6044894">These templars are spoiled. If they had witnessed what I saw in Ferelden, they'd know to never trust a mage.</string>
  <string id="6044900">Is there any recommendation you would have me bring to Meredith, Champion?</string>
  <string id="6044901">If you killed every man who doubted Meredith's fitness, Kirkwall would be a ghost town.</string>
  <string id="6044902">Be merciful.</string>
  <string id="6044903">You think that reason enough to spare blood mages and their willing dupes?</string>
  <string id="6044909">They used illegal magic in a plot against the Order. I say execute them.</string>
  <string id="6044910">Kill them all.</string>
  <string id="6044911">I can see why the knight-commander thinks so highly of you.</string>
  <string id="6044917">Take Samson too, men. If he knew so much about this plan, he must have been part of it.</string>
  <string id="6044920">No! Please!</string>
  <string id="6044923">She should consider reinstating Samson. When it came down to it, he showed where his heart is.</string>
  <string id="6044924">Give Samson another chance.</string>
  <string id="6044925">True. Samson, you have done us a great service. Do you wish to take up the shield once more?</string>
  <string id="6044928">M-more than anything, Knight-Captain ser!</string>
  <string id="6044931">Then I'll see what I can do. </string>
  <string id="6044934">Thank you, ser! </string>
  <string id="6044937">I'm sure the knight-commander will be pleased to hear the ringleaders are dead.</string>

  <string id="6046839">Depends.</string>
  <string id="6046840">Chuckles</string>
  <string id="6046843">His father implied as much.</string>

  <string id="6046879">Not a single thought given to the fact that you templars brought all of this upon yourselves?</string>
  <string id="6046882">Be very careful, mage. Your friendship with the Champion protects you only so much.</string>
  <string id="6046883">This is not the time, Anders.</string>
  <string id="6046884">Anders, be quiet.</string>
  <string id="6046887">You've gone too far, and you know it.</string>
  <string id="6046888">Anders is right.</string>

  <string id="6046936">We do what we think is best for this city, mage. That is all we can do.</string>
  <string id="6046941">Enough. I have not the patience to argue with you further.</string>
  <string id="6046947">Emile was killed.</string>
  <string id="6046948">He's dead.</string>
  <string id="6046952">I let him go. He's no harm to anyone.</string>
  <string id="6046953">He's gone.</string>
  <string id="6046954">Sighs Mages can tell slippery lies. You are a fool to think that Emile is anything but a serpent in disguise.</string>
  <string id="6046957">No matter, I will track De Launcet down. You have done what I asked you to do.</string>
  <string id="6046958">Emile de Launcet wasn't dangerous! Have you even met the boy?</string>

  <string id="6047196">Sighs Perhaps some of them might still be saved.</string>
  <string id="6047219">We'll protect your precious shipment. Just make sure you have the Coterie's payment.</string>
  <string id="6047232">They're not letting anyone into the city.</string>
  <string id="6047235">What? That can't be!</string>
  <string id="6047238">It's true. Look at them all.</string>
  <string id="6047241">They're Fereldans, just like us. Fleeing for their lives.</string>
  <string id="6047244">Are we really surprised? Everyone's fleeing the Blight, just as we are.</string>
  <string id="6047247">And they would throw us all back to the wolves. Unbelievable.</string>
  <string id="6047248">We're getting into the city, one way or another.</string>
  <string id="6047249">They can try.</string>
  <string id="6047250">So long as we're all safe, that's more important.</string>
  <string id="6047251">Is everyone all right?</string>
  <string id="6047252">I'm only surprised they let us dock.</string>
  <string id="6047253">It's totally believable.</string>
  <string id="6047256">We need to find Gamlen. Our family has always been highly regarded in Kirkwall. He can do something, I'm sure of it!</string>
  <string id="6047259">Let's hope he received your letter.</string>
  <string id="6047262">Let's hope he received your letter.</string>
  <string id="6047265">The guards seem to be reporting to that man. Perhaps we should speak to him.</string>
  <string id="6047283">I've heard you have dealings with certain... elements... in the city. You can get things done, on the sly as they say?</string>
  <string id="6047335">Well, dog. Are you ready to bark now?</string>
  <string id="6047336">Sabin will pay you back if you let him go.</string>
  <string id="6047337">Sabin will make this right.</string>
  <string id="6047367">They even killed his dog to prove a point. His dog, Hubert! You know how important they are to Fereldans.</string>
  <string id="6047374">So that was your uncle, was it? Good. I thought he was another confidence man trying to sell promises.</string>
  <string id="6047377">I don't suppose he has the coin you'll need to get in.</string>
  <string id="6047378">He doesn't seem to have any more than we do.</string>
  <string id="6047379">No, he doesn't.</string>
  <string id="6047380">Ah, that's a shame.</string>
  <string id="6047383">We just helped save your life. Isn't that worth something?</string>
  <string id="6047384">What about our help?</string>
  <string id="6047385">He had some ideas.</string>
  <string id="6047386">He might have a way.</string>
  <string id="6047387">They always do.</string>
  <string id="6047390">If it were just up to me, I'd let you through. But there are a lot of eyes watching, a lot of palms that need greasing.</string>
  <string id="6047393">My suggestion? Wait for a ship and hope the next city hasn't already closed their doors.</string>
  <string id="6047399">Good luck, whatever you do.</string>
  <string id="6047400">You've gained quite a reputation with the Red Iron mercenary band.</string>
  <string id="6047403">I find myself in need of someone with your… special talents.</string>
  <string id="6047404">What of it, old man?</string>
  <string id="6047405">And?</string>
  <string id="6047409">I am a magistrate in this city and I expect to be addressed with respect. Especially from someone who might be working for me soon...</string>
  <string id="6047410">Is there something I can help with?</string>
  <string id="6047411">What is it you need?</string>
  <string id="6047412">I am a magistrate in this city and as such, I wish to hire you for a small, albeit important, job.</string>
  <string id="6047413">That's a fancy way to put it.</string>
  <string id="6047414">On the sly?</string>
  <string id="6047427">This does not make it right, what he did. But it takes the sting off. After all I have done for these poor refugees...</string>
  <string id="6047430">All you've done?</string>
  <string id="6047439">Feh. There's a thousand such sob stories in Lowtown. </string>
  <string id="6047450">There's an ambush planned tonight at Dietrich Crossing.</string>
  <string id="6047453">Oh really? I am more inclined to beat the coin out of this sheep swallop. And then kill him.</string>
  <string id="6047456">He's nothing, Hubert. Take his offer and cut him loose so we can get back to business.</string>
  <string id="6047459">Fine! Get me your ill-gotten coin before I change my mind.</string>
  <string id="6047462">A public showing of mercy will be good for morale. Let him go.</string>
  <string id="6047463">We're letting Sabin go.</string>
  <string id="6047467">Get back to the crowd, you lot. Trying to bully your way through won't get you into Kirkwall any faster!</string>
  <string id="6047470">But you do intend to let us in?</string>
  <string id="6047473">There must be someone in charge I can speak with.</string>
  <string id="6047474">Tell me who to talk to.</string>
  <string id="6047475">Sighs Yes, yes, always the same story.</string>
  <string id="6047478">Talk to Captain Ewald. Don't talk to me.</string>
  <string id="6047482">I guess saving his ass didn't get you into the city either, huh? Laughs</string>
  <string id="6047485">I wouldn't laugh quite so loudly if I were you.</string>

  <string id="6047515">But he is a Ferel— a criminal. Nobody will care what happens to him.</string>
  <string id="6047518">Think about it. Sabin turned to crime for two reasons: he's desperate, and he bears no love for you.</string>
  <string id="6047524">Spare him publicly, and you'll earn some loyalty from the miners.</string>
  <string id="6047527">I see your point. Very well, for the sake of... morale, I will spare this dog.</string>
  <string id="6047528">Hawke,&#13;

Thank you for persuading Emile to do the right thing. The boy may not recognize it, but you probably saved his life. I don't know how to repay you, but perhaps this coin is a good start.&#13;

Thank you for persuading Emile to do the right thing. The boy may not recognize it, but you probably saved his life. You've shown again and again that you are Kirkwall's Champion. I will never be able to fully repay you for saving my family and helping the city, but perhaps this is a good start.&#13;

May the Maker turn his gaze on you.&#13;

  <string id="6047585">Dear Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
Thank you for your trust and giving me the chance to truly live. You don't have to worry about me. The Circle, as strict as it was, taught me well. As long as I keep my mouth shut and stay away from magic, I should be all right.&#13;
&#13;
I've since bedded a woman much better looking than any wench in the Hanged Man. I wrote another letter with all the details, but you probably don't want to hear about it. (I've learned some discretion! Aren't you proud of me?)&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, I've enclosed a little item that helped my studies in the Circle. I no longer need it, and maybe you'll meet someone who can put it to good use.&#13;
&#13;
Ever grateful,&#13;

It took great courage the other day for you to speak openly against our knight-commander. You have my support in any actions you take. I hope I have yours as well, for there is a situation in the Circle I was hoping you could assist me with. Please meet me at the Gallows. Meredith has confined my mages to their cells and forbade me from traveling further than the Courtyard. I appreciate your service and discretion.&#13;

&#13;
Thank you so much for telling Bodahn about us. He knows many people in Kirkwall and has found homes and jobs for most of us. I'm helping him out as a delivery boy. Much better than digging in the trash for food!&#13;
&#13;
Cricket now lives with a nice family in Hightown. They saw him at the marketplace and wanted to help. They even tried giving him a new name! Charles, maybe, but he answers only to Cricket.&#13;
&#13;
Thanks again for helping us. I'll never forget you.&#13;

  <string id="6048107">Ah! Welcome, my dear friend, to Sol's shop. My name is Solivitus. Please, take a look around.</string>
  <string id="6048110">My apologies in advance. Our shelves are a bit bare at the moment.</string>
  <string id="6048113">Actually, if you're interested, I could use a bit of help to remedy that.</string>
  <string id="6048114">How can I help?</string>
  <string id="6048115">What do you need?</string>
  <string id="6048116">Talk.</string>
  <string id="6048117">Get on with it.</string>
  <string id="6048118">All business. I like you.</string>
  <string id="6048121">Remedy that. Potions shop. You, my good man, are priceless.</string>
  <string id="6048122">Remedy that?</string>
  <string id="6048123">The pun wasn't intentional, although I may use that next time!</string>
  <string id="6048129">It's been too dangerous to leave the city of late, and the substances I require for my creations are, of course, elsewhere.</string>
  <string id="6048132">Perhaps you could find them. You'll be compensated for your time, have no fear. I'll also give you first pick of my new creations!</string>
  <string id="6048133">Make up a list of what you need, and I'll keep an eye out for you.</string>
  <string id="6048134">I'm in.</string>
  <string id="6048135">Perfect! A discount on everything in the shop, serah!</string>
  <string id="6048139">Sorry, I'm not interested.</string>
  <string id="6048140">No thanks.</string>
  <string id="6048141">Ah. Well, that's unfortunate.</string>
  <string id="6048145">The spider's silk gland! I hope the fellow you took this from didn't give you much trouble.</string>

  <string id="6048178">If you're interested in hunting down more ingredients, I can make other creations. And of course, I'll pay you for your work!</string>
  <string id="6048179">Sure, just let me know what you need.</string>
  <string id="6048180">I'll do it.</string>
  <string id="6048181">Perfect! I have a list of the ingredients right here.</string>
  <string id="6048185">I appreciate the offer, but I have to decline.</string>
  <string id="6048186">No thanks.</string>
  <string id="6048187">That's disappointing, but I'm grateful for everything you've done. You'll always have a discount at my shop!</string>
  <string id="6048191">This is a waste of my time.</string>
  <string id="6048192">No thanks.</string>
  <string id="6048193">Oh. Well... Do know you're always welcome at my shop.</string>
  <string id="6048194">I'm afraid my skills are needed elsewhere.</string>
  <string id="6048195">No thanks.</string>
  <string id="6048196">Of course, of course. Come back anytime. The discount still stands!</string>
  <string id="6048200">Harlot's Blush! What a scandalous name for such a pretty flower...</string>
  <string id="6048206">The Dalish actually agreed to part with the ink? Or did you... No, never mind. Better that I don't know.</string>
  <string id="6048212">Ew. Perhaps allow more of the blood to drain from the heart next time?</string>
  <string id="6048224">Welcome back to Sol's, my friend!</string>
  <string id="6048227">A man I sentenced to a life in prison has escaped custody. He's been tracked to an abandoned ruin outside the city.</string>
  <string id="6048230">I'd like you to retrieve the fugitive, and hand him over to the guard.</string>
  <string id="6048234">We're both intelligent people. There's something in the ruins, isn't there?</string>
  <string id="6048235">This sounds too easy.</string>
  <string id="6048236">Why is there such a clamor to catch this man, what has he done?</string>
  <string id="6048237">What was this man's crime?</string>
  <string id="6048238">The guards can take care of this, unless there's something else you're not telling me.</string>
  <string id="6048239">This is a grunt job.</string>
  <string id="6048249">The men refuse to go in without reinforcements. The ruins have been overrun by strange... creatures.</string>
  <string id="6048250">I'm sure if you send in enough men this time, they'd do fine.</string>
  <string id="6048251">So why not send more guards?</string>
  <string id="6048252">No. The more guards who know, the easier it is for this to get out. Those men gossip like old fishwives.</string>
  <string id="6048256">It would be easier to seal up the entrance and let the beasts take care of him.</string>
  <string id="6048257">Why not just let him be eaten?</string>
  <string id="6048258">I believe in justice, Fereldan, not unbridled slaughter.</string>
  <string id="6048259">I'll take the job.</string>
  <string id="6048260">All right, I'll do it.</string>
  <string id="6048261">Bring the fugitive in alive, quickly and quietly.</string>
  <string id="6048267">You'll have to find someone else, Magistrate. I don't have the time right now.</string>
  <string id="6048268">No, I can't help you.</string>
  <string id="6048269">That is very disappointing. I want to keep this quiet. To do that, I can't send a whole squadron to apprehend one man.</string>
  <string id="6048272">If you change your mind—and I hope you do—I'll be here.</string>
  <string id="6048283">I'll deal with Hubert. Just give us something to go on. </string>
  <string id="6048284">I'll help you.</string>
  <string id="6048285">Oh thank you, messere! I'll talk.</string>
  <string id="6048286">So you value your family's welfare over the lives of others?</string>
  <string id="6048287">You're beyond redemption.</string>
  <string id="6048288">I'll make sure your family is taken care of.</string>
  <string id="6048289">I'll sweeten the pot.</string>
  <string id="6048290">I'm humbled by that offer. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6048294">Welcome back, my friend!  My store has never been better stocked, thanks to you!</string>
  <string id="6048297">Although I have nothing else to ask you to find, you're quite welcome to bring back any rare specimens you may come across.</string>
  <string id="6048303">I took this fire gland from a high dragon just outside the city.</string>
  <string id="6048306">You killed a high dragon? Incredible! Let me see the fire gland...</string>
  <string id="6048307">Just hurry up. You're wasting my time.</string>
  <string id="6048308">Take it.</string>
  <string id="6048309">This fire gland is a remarkable specimen... Wait here. I know exactly what I can craft from this.</string>

  <string id="6048378">Circle Mage</string>
  <string id="6048383">He didn't do this on his own. The artifact from the thaig warped his mind.</string>
  <string id="6048384">The statue drove him mad.</string>
  <string id="6048385">Come on, Varric. Let's go drink until we can't see straight. That'll make you feel better.</string>
  <string id="6048386">Don't think about it.</string>
  <string id="6048387">Maker... what have I done? I never wanted people to get hurt. I'll tell you what I know.</string>
  <string id="6048392">When you don't tell me what I want to know, it just makes me want to hit you.</string>
  <string id="6048393">I'll make you talk!</string>
  <string id="6048394">Groans</string>
  <string id="6048397">Please... please stop! I'll tell you everything. Even where I hid some gold at the Bone Pit!</string>
  <string id="6048409">Remember: it's Meeran or Athenril you're looking for. Either of them can help you out.</string>
  <string id="6048413">Any luck?</string>
  <string id="6048416">It's done.</string>
  <string id="6048419">Yes. They've agreed to help us.</string>
  <string id="6048422">Was there ever any doubt?</string>
  <string id="6048425">I'll speak to Athenril and see when the bribes can be made. Wait here.</string>
  <string id="6048428">I'll speak to Meeran and see when the bribes can be made. Wait here.</string>
  <string id="6048431">Then we made it. The voyage is over.</string>
  <string id="6048432">I guess we did it. We're here to stay, at least for a while.</string>
  <string id="6048433">We'll see what happens when this debt is repaid.</string>
  <string id="6048434">For a year.</string>
  <string id="6048435">The Blight may still spread, but for now we have a new home.</string>
  <string id="6048436">So long as we're safe.</string>
  <string id="6048437">No more running for our lives unless we really have to.</string>
  <string id="6048438">Let's not do that again.</string>
  <string id="6048439">If only Bethany were here with us.</string>
  <string id="6048442">If only Carver were here with us.</string>
  <string id="6048445">And Wesley.</string>
  <string id="6048451">Let's just see what happens. We have a long year ahead of us.</string>
  <string id="6048457">Gamlen!</string>
  <string id="6048460">Sure. That worked real well for those soldiers we fought.</string>
  <string id="6048463">That didn't turn out so well for those deserters earlier.</string>
  <string id="6048466">I hate to agree, but there's a reason they housed us in an old prison.</string>
  <string id="6048469">I don't like this idea.</string>
  <string id="6048470">This was my home! I can't believe they won't let me come back.</string>
  <string id="6048473">Every city on the coast's been hip-deep in Fereldans since the Blight.</string>
  <string id="6048476">You could try your luck further inland, I suppose. But it won't be easy.</string>
  <string id="6048479">No. We're not putting Mother through that. We'll find a way.</string>
  <string id="6048480">I don't like this idea.</string>
  <string id="6048481">We're not putting Mother through that. We came here, we're staying here.</string>
  <string id="6048482">I don't like this idea.</string>
  <string id="6048483">I talked to my contacts and I found some people who might be willing to pay your way into the city.</string>
  <string id="6048486">The catch is you and your sister have to work off the debt. For a year.</string>
  <string id="6048489">The catch is you and your brother will have to work off the debt. For a year.</string>
  <string id="6048492">A year!</string>
  <string id="6048495">It's the best I could do! Trust me when I say a bunch of refugees won't get a better option anywhere else.</string>
  <string id="6048496">Unless you brought an ogre's head along on the boat, I doubt it.</string>
  <string id="6048499">Think of it as having a job waiting for you in your new home!</string>
  <string id="6048502">Wonderful.</string>
  <string id="6048505">I guess it's only a year, right?</string>
  <string id="6048508">I managed to convince my contacts to come to the Gallows to meet you personally.</string>
  <string id="6048511">Meeran heads up the mercenary company, the Red Iron. They're looking for recruits.</string>
  <string id="6048514">Either one of them can help you. All you need to do is find them in the courtyard and convince them you're worth the trouble.</string>
  <string id="6048515">Oh Gamlen, I don't know about this.</string>
  <string id="6048518">It's a lot of coin, Leandra. Don't go expecting our name to carry the kind of weight it used to.</string>
  <string id="6048523">Search the bodies of the Hightown conspirators for clues.</string>
  <string id="6048574">I always thought he was more prone to puppy-kicking than... mutilation and torture.</string>
  <string id="6048575">Don't let him completely off the hook. </string>
  <string id="6048576">Awe, that's sweet. But watching you get sick won't cheer me up. Much.</string>
  <string id="6048665">Go to the conspiracy's recruitment point in Gardibali's Warehouse on the Lowtown Docks at night.</string>
  <string id="6048669">Keran</string>
  <string id="6048676">Locate three apostate mages hiding in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6048680">Would you mind telling me who you are?</string>
  <string id="6048681">And you are?</string>
  <string id="6048690">The dragon fang was not found.</string>
  <string id="6048691">The giant spider silk gland was not found.</string>
  <string id="6048692">The ironbark was not found.</string>
  <string id="6048704">Move along, citizen.</string>
  <string id="6048720">I hear getting us into the city isn't cheap.</string>
  <string id="6048721">You're offering a lot for us.</string>
  <string id="6048722">If you're as good as your uncle claims, we're hoping you'll be worth it.</string>
  <string id="6048725">After all, it's not every day we're offered an apostate's services.</string>
  <string id="6048726">I didn't realize Gamlen had told you that much.</string>
  <string id="6048727">You know I'm a mage?</string>
  <string id="6048729">It appears our uncle likes to talk.</string>
  <string id="6048730">You know Bethany is a mage?</string>
  <string id="6048731">Tell me what you need done.</string>
  <string id="6048732">I'll do whatever it takes.</string>
  <string id="6048733">There's a merchant named Cavril. Friend of the templars, so they let him set up his little shop here in the Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6048736">We supplied him in return for a piece of the take, but now he won't pay up.</string>
  <string id="6048739">We can't go near him without him screaming for the guard—but you can. Get our money from him and you're in.</string>
  <string id="6048742">I'll find some other way into the city.</string>
  <string id="6048743">Not interested.</string>
  <string id="6048744">Suit yourself. I'll be around for a bit if you change your mind.</string>
  <string id="6048750">Changed your mind? Or no?</string>
  <string id="6048751">No, I haven't.</string>
  <string id="6048758">Let me know when Cavril coughs up what he owes us.</string>
  <string id="6048762">It's done.</string>
  <string id="6048765">Will you look at that. </string>
  <string id="6048768">Tell your uncle we'll make the arrangements. Welcome aboard.</string>
  <string id="6048774">For the last time—get out!</string>
  <string id="6048777">I see. Have it your way, then.</string>
  <string id="6048786">Not interested.</string>
  <string id="6048802">Getting us into the city will take a lot of coin.</string>
  <string id="6048803">You're paying a lot of money.</string>
  <string id="6048804">Laughs Did I mention the Red Iron gets paid pretty well?</string>
  <string id="6048807">Not to mention your uncle said you were a mage. We're willing to pay for that.</string>
  <string id="6048808">I didn't realize Gamlen told you that.</string>
  <string id="6048809">You know I'm a mage?</string>
  <string id="6048810">Not to mention your uncle said your sister's a mage. We're willing to pay for that.</string>
  <string id="6048811">Apparently Uncle Gamlen likes to talk.</string>
  <string id="6048812">You know Bethany is a mage?</string>
  <string id="6048813">I'm ready to prove myself.</string>
  <string id="6048814">I'll do whatever you need.</string>
  <string id="6048815">Noble bastard named Friedrich is here in the Gallows. Gave us bad info, almost killed my men.</string>
  <string id="6048821">But he doesn't know you. Go kill him and his men. We'll make sure no one asks why.</string>
  <string id="6048824">I'll find some other way into the city.</string>
  <string id="6048825">Not interested.</string>
  <string id="6048826">Let me know how that works out for you.</string>
  <string id="6048832">You again. Still too good to work for the Red Iron?</string>
  <string id="6048840">Haven't heard any screaming. I'm guessing that traitor's still alive.</string>
  <string id="6048844">It's done.</string>
  <string id="6048847">Good. May the bloody vultures feast on his corpse and shit him into the ocean.</string>
  <string id="6048850">Welcome to the Red Iron. Tell your uncle I'm making the arrangements now.</string>
  <string id="6048865">Docks</string>
  <string id="6048923">Go to the conspiracy's stronghold on the Wounded Coast to determine the extent of the plotting against Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6048945">Isabela's Hangout</string>
  <string id="6048960">Stop your shaking, dwarf. You're safe.</string>
  <string id="6048961">The danger is passed. Are you all right?</string>
  <string id="6048962">Out of your element, dwarf?</string>
  <string id="6048966">The traitor escaped.</string>
  <string id="6048969">Well done. I hope whatever he offered you was enough to get you in on your own.</string>
  <string id="6049021">Samson</string>
  <string id="6049070">Thrask</string>
  <string id="6049074">Alain</string>
  <string id="6049078">Grace</string>
  <string id="6049087">Thanks for dealing with the cargo thefts.</string>
  <string id="6049096">Hello again, partner. I trust business is good?</string>
  <string id="6049134">I'm sorry about your daughter, but murdering this man outright is no solution.</string>
  <string id="6049135">I'm not going to kill anyone.</string>
  <string id="6049136">We're easy prey, no one thinks twice when an elven child disappears.</string>
  <string id="6049150">You are allowed, basra, until the Arishok declares otherwise.</string>
  <string id="6049213">You have no business here, basra.</string>
  <string id="6049214">Go away, human. This ground is ours by treaty.</string>
  <string id="6049215">If we must stay here, we will do so without you intruding. Leave.</string>
  <string id="6049218">Let me pass. I have business with the dwarf Javaris and your Arishok.</string>
  <string id="6049221">The short mouth, yes. Enter, if you must, basra.</string>
  <string id="6049224">Enter if you must.</string>
  <string id="6049225">All are forbidden. You are the exception—for now.</string>
  <string id="6049228">Lia? Your father told us you were dead!</string>
  <string id="6049231">My father? Is he safe? Kelder said that he'd hurt my family if I didn't come with him...</string>
  <string id="6049236">No thanks to this lot. Can't get a decent blade at a bargain anymore.</string>
  <string id="6049254">Go to the conspiracy's stronghold on the Wounded Coast to rescue Bethany.</string>
  <string id="6049255">Go to the conspiracy's stronghold on the Wounded Coast to rescue Carver.</string>
  <string id="6049256">Go to the conspiracy's stronghold on the Wounded Coast to rescue Anders.</string>
  <string id="6049257">Go to the conspiracy's stronghold on the Wounded Coast to rescue Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6049258">Go to the conspiracy's stronghold on the Wounded Coast to rescue Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6049259">Go to the conspiracy's stronghold on the Wounded Coast to rescue Varric.</string>
  <string id="6049261">Go to the conspiracy's stronghold on the Wounded Coast to rescue Isabela.</string>
  <string id="6049262">Go to the conspiracy's stronghold on the Wounded Coast to rescue Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6049281">Don't expect any mercy!</string>
  <string id="6049282">You won't be forgiven for this!</string>
  <string id="6049283">This will be quick!</string>
  <string id="6049284">Demons take you!</string>
  <string id="6049285">Aim for the heart!</string>
  <string id="6049289">I'm getting overwhelmed!</string>
  <string id="6049290">Defend me!</string>
  <string id="6049294">To me, men!</string>
  <string id="6049295">To my side!</string>
  <string id="6049299">This is getting me nowhere!</string>
  <string id="6049300">Maybe I should try something else!</string>
  <string id="6049304">So much better!</string>
  <string id="6049305">You won't get me that easily!</string>
  <string id="6049314">I can't... break... free!</string>
  <string id="6049315">I'm caught!</string>
  <string id="6049319">This is taking too long!</string>
  <string id="6049320">My arm is failing...</string>
  <string id="6049324">I'm not sure I'll make it...</string>
  <string id="6049326">Not here... I can't die here!</string>
  <string id="6049330">No one can stand against the Imperium!</string>
  <string id="6049331">This one is taken care of!</string>
  <string id="6049335">Why isn't this working?</string>
  <string id="6049336">This is useless!</string>
  <string id="6049340">There!</string>
  <string id="6049341">Nasty little sneak!</string>
  <string id="6049345">Mages!</string>
  <string id="6049346">Get the mage! Don't damage him!</string>
  <string id="6049350">Go for the archer!</string>
  <string id="6049351">The archer! Kill the archer!</string>
  <string id="6049355">They're too powerful! Retreat!</string>
  <string id="6049356">I will not die today!</string>
  <string id="6049423">Good to see you, friend. Have you come to browse my exquisite wares?</string>
  <string id="6049428">Are you Athenril?</string>
  <string id="6049431">You must be Gamlen's nephew. Interesting.</string>
  <string id="6049434">You must be Gamlen's niece. Interesting.</string>
  <string id="6049437">I don't know what he told you about us, but he certainly told us a great deal about you.</string>
  <string id="6049440">He didn't say anything about me, did he?</string>
  <string id="6049443">Er... how much, exactly?</string>
  <string id="6049446">Enough to pique our interest, provided you can justify your uncle's confidence.</string>
  <string id="6049447">I'd like to know more about what we'd be doing for you.</string>
  <string id="6049448">So you're a smuggler?</string>
  <string id="6049449">I can be honest. We don't compete with the thieves' guild, but we keep our fingers in a lot of pots.</string>
  <string id="6049452">That said, we're not killers or slavers. Anything short of that, however, is fair game.</string>
  <string id="6049455">Do what you want, but this sounds fishy to me.</string>
  <string id="6049458">We can't afford to be choosy.</string>
  <string id="6049459">Begging and taking your pick never went hand-in-hand.</string>
  <string id="6049460">How did you get to be one of my uncle's contacts?</string>
  <string id="6049461">How do you know Gamlen?</string>
  <string id="6049462">Is that what he calls me?</string>
  <string id="6049465">He owes us after that last big idea. If you turn out, though, we'll consider things even.</string>
  <string id="6049466">The templars in Kirkwall like to think they have all mages properly leashed, but when has that ever been true?</string>
  <string id="6049469">We can keep them from taking notice while you're with us. Wouldn't be the first time.</string>
  <string id="6049470">You're a smuggler?</string>
  <string id="6049471">Here you go, as requested.</string>
  <string id="6049474">You could have given us something more challenging.</string>
  <string id="6049477">What for? We haven't done anything.</string>
  <string id="6049480">We know damned well what you've been up to. Now go!</string>
  <string id="6049489">I'll cut you good!</string>
  <string id="6049490">I'll kill you!</string>
  <string id="6049491">Smash them good!</string>
  <string id="6049492">Go for the face!</string>
  <string id="6049496">I need a hand here!</string>
  <string id="6049497">Get 'em off me!</string>
  <string id="6049501">Over here, ya imbeciles!</string>
  <string id="6049502">Get over here!</string>
  <string id="6049506">Maybe this'll work better!</string>
  <string id="6049507">Got to try something else!</string>
  <string id="6049511">This'll help!</string>
  <string id="6049512">That's better!</string>
  <string id="6049521">Andraste's ass, they got me!</string>
  <string id="6049522">I'm stuck!</string>
  <string id="6049526">Why isn't this done yet?</string>
  <string id="6049527">I got no power left.</string>
  <string id="6049531">So... tired...</string>
  <string id="6049532">I got nothing left!</string>
  <string id="6049536">Maker... help me!</string>
  <string id="6049537">They're gonna kill me...</string>
  <string id="6049538">Save me, you bastards!</string>
  <string id="6049542">Got you!</string>
  <string id="6049543">This one's down!</string>
  <string id="6049547">Flamin' thing's doing nothing!</string>
  <string id="6049548">Useless piece of junk!</string>
  <string id="6049552">You there!</string>
  <string id="6049553">Damned sneak!</string>
  <string id="6049557">Take out the hexer first!</string>
  <string id="6049558">The robe's an easy kill!</string>
  <string id="6049562">Kill that archer!</string>
  <string id="6049563">You idiots! Kill the archer first!</string>
  <string id="6049567">I'm not going to die here!</string>
  <string id="6049568">No use dying over this!</string>
  <string id="6049624">Ah, my right hand arrives! Summon your Arishok—the bargain is done!</string>
  <string id="6049627">About time you showed. I've been here for hours.</string>
  <string id="6049636">Ahem. Illustrious Arishok. I am here to report that your hated Tal-Vashoth were felled one and all. Right? Yes, yes, yes, they were.</string>
  <string id="6049642">So, I'm ready to open negotiations. For the explosive powder. As we agreed.</string>
  <string id="6049648">No.</string>
  <string id="6049651">He's not getting it. Say something.</string>
  <string id="6049652">The Tal-Vashoth camped at the Wounded Coast are dead. You won't honor your bargain?</string>
  <string id="6049653">Qunari do not honor a deal?</string>
  <string id="6049654">You arranged this. You deal with it.</string>
  <string id="6049655">Speak for yourself.</string>
  <string id="6049656">I don't care about your deal. I was hired to hunt outcasts and I want my reward.</string>
  <string id="6049657">I just want my payment.</string>
  <string id="6049661">Don't forget! As soon as you're finished wrapping up your business, we'll need to go to the Qunari Compound together.</string>
  <string id="6049667">Return to Gamlen's Lowtown home.</string>
  <string id="6049671">What kind of demons? What did they look like?</string>
  <string id="6049672">Demons?</string>
  <string id="6049673">It doesn't matter if the Maker himself was telling this man to hurt you, it's still his own damned decision.</string>
  <string id="6049674">He's still responsible.</string>
  <string id="6049675">I'll have to remember to use that. A demon made me do it!</string>
  <string id="6049676">What a brilliant excuse.</string>
  <string id="6049677">I... don't know what they look like. I didn't actually see any of them.</string>
  <string id="6049692">Apostate</string>
  <string id="6049706">I visited Feynriel at the Circle. He refused to see me.</string>
  <string id="6049707">I talked to the templars. They won't let me see Feynriel! No one will tell me what's happening...</string>
  <string id="6049708">Feynriel's having nightmares again. The templars have him locked in his cell. They won't let him corrupt the other mages.</string>
  <string id="6049709">Oh, Creators, I hope we did the right thing...</string>
  <string id="6049713">I tried to go back to the People to be with Feynriel, but the Keeper wouldn't have me.</string>
  <string id="6049714">The Keeper says I must give my son space. She says he has too much anger for us to be together.</string>
  <string id="6049715">Feynriel is still having nightmares. The Keeper doesn't know how to help him.</string>
  <string id="6049716">The Keeper says Feynriel's nightmares remind her of something out of the histories. She's going to research his condition.</string>
  <string id="6049717">Feynriel should have gone to the Circle. They would know how to help him there.</string>
  <string id="6049721">Ogre</string>
  <string id="6049730">I hear your lad Feynriel managed to give the Order the slip. Good for him.</string>
  <string id="6049734">I hear they got your boy Feynriel locked up in the Circle. Bad business, that.</string>
  <string id="6049735">It ain't all templars that're bad. It's hard luck being born a robe, but most places, they make it work.</string>
  <string id="6049736">That bitch Meredith runs the Order in this town like her private army.</string>
  <string id="6049739">You don't tow the line, you end up on the next corner here in Darktown.</string>
  <string id="6049740">I don't think you got to hate mages to love the Order. But Meredith don't agree.</string>
  <string id="6049741">Toss me a silver for some dust?</string>
  <string id="6049742">Find an NPC.</string>
  <string id="6049743">Find an NPC.</string>
  <string id="6049744">Who?</string>

  <string id="6049814">Only fair you share some of that good fortune with those of us still hurting, no?</string>
  <string id="6049815">I was a refugee when I came here. If I could turn my luck around, so can you.</string>
  <string id="6049816">You can do better than this.</string>

  <string id="6050173">I came to kill you.</string>
  <string id="6050174">Sorry, but you brought this on yourself.</string>
  <string id="6050175">I came to kill you.</string>
  <string id="6050176">Fair question, really. To shut you up.</string>
  <string id="6050177">I came to kill you.</string>
  <string id="6050178">Don't just stand there! Kill them!</string>
  <string id="6050179">Tell me why I shouldn't kill you, and make it good.</string>
  <string id="6050180">I came to talk.</string>

  <string id="6050188">Look, you... I don't know what that pissant thug is paying you, but I'll double it! Just let us go!</string>
  <string id="6050189">Make it worth my time and I'll let you go.</string>
  <string id="6050190">Very well.</string>
  <string id="6050194">Or I could take the money off your corpse.</string>
  <string id="6050195">Forget it.</string>
  <string id="6050196">Sorry, but that's not good enough.</string>
  <string id="6050197">Forget it.</string>
  <string id="6050198">And face the mercenaries myself? No thanks.</string>
  <string id="6050199">Forget it.</string>

If you're looking for work, there's a rich merchant in Hightown who's got trouble with his mining operation. If you haven't heard of the Bone Pit, the locals say it's cursed. I don't put much stock in it, but I had to turn down the job because of Marchers in my crew making the rest superstitious. &#13;
&#13;
Go speak to Hubert Bartiere in the Hightown Market if you're interested.&#13;

  <string id="6051578">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="6051579">You mean you paid your own bribes to be here.</string>
  <string id="6051580">Lucky indeed.</string>
  <string id="6051581">If they allowed everyone to set up shop, this place would turn into a bazaar!</string>
  <string id="6051584">Sadly, there's only so much I can do for those Fereldans. Poor sods.</string>
  <string id="6051587">I'm sure you're very broken up over it.</string>

  <string id="6051591">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="6051592">As you wish, serah.</string>
  <string id="6051595">Oh... I see.</string>
  <string id="6051598">Should I go tell the guards?</string>
  <string id="6051601">Not just yet. I want to hear this.</string>
  <string id="6051604">So Athenril sent you to collect, did she? Too cowardly to do it herself?</string>
  <string id="6051605">You hand over what you owe and you get to walk away.</string>
  <string id="6051606">Cough it up. Or else.</string>
  <string id="6051607">This has all just been a misunderstanding, hasn't it?</string>
  <string id="6051608">We're all friends here, no?</string>
  <string id="6051609">Care to step in, here?</string>
  <string id="6051610">Aveline?</string>
  <string id="6051611">If you pay up, this needn't go any further.</string>
  <string id="6051612">There's no need for violence.</string>
  <string id="6051613">I'm here to collect and I'm not walking away.</string>
  <string id="6051614">You need to pay what you owe.</string>
  <string id="6051615">Make me an offer and I'll consider leaving you alone.</string>
  <string id="6051616">I could be persuaded to go.</string>
  <string id="6051617">No! I'm not paying you thieves a single copper more!</string>
  <string id="6051620">That sounds like where we come in.</string>
  <string id="6051621">Hmm. Interesting.</string>
  <string id="6051624">I can't get you lot into the city—that's more coin than I even owe. But I'll give you a share.</string>
  <string id="6051627">You take it, you walk away and don't bother us again. Does that... work for you?</string>
  <string id="6051628">Let's see it.</string>
  <string id="6051629">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6051630">I'd rather not fight over this.</string>
  <string id="6051631">Yes</string>
  <string id="6051632">Who wouldn't that work for?</string>
  <string id="6051633">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6051634">Boss, you need to stop giving into these—</string>
  <string id="6051637">Enough. I know a losing deal when I see one.</string>
  <string id="6051640">Take what's in the chest. Now I'm going to go deal with this once and for all.</string>
  <string id="6051641">Not good enough.</string>
  <string id="6051642">No.</string>
  <string id="6051643">I'm afraid not.</string>
  <string id="6051644">No.</string>
  <string id="6051645">Oh, come on. You can't be serious!</string>
  <string id="6051646">No.</string>
  <string id="6051647">Negotiation time is over!</string>
  <string id="6051650">Greetings once again, serah! Have you come to trade?</string>
  <string id="6051651">No. I'll go.</string>
  <string id="6051654">Hey there! What are you doing with that?</string>
  <string id="6051660">Back away from it, friend. Now.</string>
  <string id="6051667">But... he has to sell—it's a product. People want it.</string>
  <string id="6051670">There is no profit in empowering those not of the Qun. The means of creating the gaatlok is ours alone.</string>
  <string id="6051673">It shall be dispensed only to our enemies, in the traditional manner.</string>
  <string id="6051676">You... are a frustrating people.</string>
  <string id="6051680">You said yourself, there was no bargain. I'm not getting a sodding thing out of this.</string>
  <string id="6051686">This human did what you could not—something I did not expect of any outsider. And you have involved me.</string>
  <string id="6051689">If you made a bargain for the Tal-Vashoth, that debt for their lives will be honored.</string>
  <string id="6051695">Sod it all, take your coin. Take whatever.</string>
  <string id="6051698">Horn-head oxmen and mongrel dog lords. Suck your own powder and blow your head off. Sod it!</string>
  <string id="6051713">And you're fired. Sodding bunch of oxmen and dog lords. The whole lot, breathing smoke. Bah!</string>
  <string id="6051717">Dwarf, did your imaginary bargain make promises on my behalf?</string>
  <string id="6051738">Because he's an elf you... you pretend he doesn't exist?</string>
  <string id="6051739">I have a wife in Antiva. I could not hurt her by bringing the boy into our lives. I met him for the first time yesterday.</string>
  <string id="6051749">I... expected your wisdom to be more profitable.</string>
  <string id="6051752">I have nothing against elves, my lady.</string>
  <string id="6051760">Then you will pay, on my behalf.</string>
  <string id="6051764">Feynriel speaks well of how you treated him before you brought him to us.</string>
  <string id="6051767">Arianni tells me you sought a better path than the Circle for her son Feynriel.</string>
  <string id="6051771">You go on ahead. I... would rather not.</string>
  <string id="6051778">You have a better chance than I to convince them they are better off alive in the Circle than free and dead.</string>
  <string id="6051787">Where did Feynriel end up?</string>
  <string id="6051788">With the Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6051789">With the Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6051790">With the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6051791">With the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6051792">Decimus, no! Stay your hand. These are no templars.</string>
  <string id="6051798">That's it!</string>
  <string id="6051801">Just try it.</string>
  <string id="6051804">No... I don't want any more violence.</string>
  <string id="6051807">You think so?</string>
  <string id="6051810">I do! Don't you think business partners deserve a return on their investment?</string>
  <string id="6051813">Enough, enough. I'm tired of fighting over this.</string>
  <string id="6051816">Only because this toad deserves it.</string>
  <string id="6051819">You have a choice: pay, or I beat it out of you and your men.</string>
  <string id="6051822">Hey!</string>
  <string id="6051825">Stay back! Just... take what's in the chest. Take it all!</string>
  <string id="6051828">No... no it's fine. Take what's in the chest. I'll even give you the key.</string>
  <string id="6051835">Wait. This is Athenril's doing, isn't it? You can tell that bitch I'm going straight to the guard again!</string>
  <string id="6051839">Stop! Stop! Enough!</string>
  <string id="6051842">Just take what's in the chest. Take it! I hope that witch chokes on it!</string>
  <string id="6051845">Here, take the key for the chest. That should be enough to pay that witch.</string>
  <string id="6051848">Now I'm getting out of here. Let those guards find someone else to buy dog-land junk!</string>
  <string id="6051851">My children are sick! I've got to get in to find a healer!</string>
  <string id="6051852">How can they turn us all away?</string>
  <string id="6051874">Do you have coin to spare, messere? My children are starving.</string>
  <string id="6051875">I hope this helps.</string>
  <string id="6051876">Of course.</string>

  <string id="6051902">Well, you see, it is customary that effort deserves reward. I think I have shown how common need could benefit us both.</string>
  <string id="6051907">You asked for the gaatlok and were refused. So you invented a task, and then paid to have it done.</string>

  <string id="6052218">Let's try a little bit of this...</string>
  <string id="6052228">Shit!</string>
  <string id="6052229">Get me out of this!</string>
  <string id="6052230">If you wanted to tie me up, you could've just asked.</string>
  <string id="6052234">I'm going to need to catch my breath!</string>
  <string id="6052235">Too weary... you go on without me.</string>
  <string id="6052236">Feeling a bit... light-headed.</string>
  <string id="6052246">Grunts This isn't going well.</string>
  <string id="6052247">You can... handle this, right? I'm just going to... lie down here.</string>
  <string id="6052248">Being close to death is... very bad for my morale.</string>
  <string id="6052252">Ha!</string>
  <string id="6052253">And that's how it's done!</string>
  <string id="6052254">Oh, I'm good!</string>
  <string id="6052255">That was too easy!</string>
  <string id="6052256">Who's next?</string>
  <string id="6052260">I'm going to need a bigger weapon.</string>
  <string id="6052261">What is wrong with me today?</string>
  <string id="6052262">Gah!</string>
  <string id="6052266">I have to get closer!</string>
  <string id="6052267">I'm too far away! What do you want me to do? Shout at them?</string>
  <string id="6052268">I can't do anything from here!</string>
  <string id="6052272">Brace yourselves! Here they come!</string>
  <string id="6052273">The more the merrier, I suppose!</string>
  <string id="6052274">Here we go again!</string>
  <string id="6052278">Here we go!</string>
  <string id="6052279">Good! I was getting a bit bored!</string>
  <string id="6052280">Enemies! Everywhere!</string>
  <string id="6052281">Let's dance!</string>
  <string id="6052282">Come get some!</string>
  <string id="6052286">Hey, everything's spinning!</string>
  <string id="6052287">Nothing like a near death experience to get the blood pumping.</string>
  <string id="6052288">I'm all right! I'm all right!</string>
  <string id="6052289">Time for some payback!</string>
  <string id="6052290">Ugh... that was a close one.</string>
  <string id="6052294">Oh, now I'm angry!</string>
  <string id="6052295">Don't worry, I'll deal with this!</string>
  <string id="6052299">Anders!</string>
  <string id="6052303">Bastards took out Aveline!</string>
  <string id="6052307">Should've stayed back, little sister.</string>
  <string id="6052311">Watch Carver! He's down!</string>
  <string id="6052315">Oh, he's not going to be happy when he wakes up!</string>
  <string id="6052323">Merrill! Oh, blood mages are so dramatic.</string>
  <string id="6052327">Varric's out! Bianca's going to be disappointed!</string>
  <string id="6052331">Hawke's down! Time to panic!</string>
  <string id="6052335">Heh! Not so tough now, are you?</string>
  <string id="6052339">Don't you die on me!</string>
  <string id="6052343">Oh, you'll pay for that!</string>
  <string id="6052347">You hit like an Orlesian dandy!</string>
  <string id="6052348">Come on! You want some of this?</string>
  <string id="6052349">Run home while you still can!</string>
  <string id="6052353">I've got your back!</string>
  <string id="6052354">Just hold on! Isabela's coming!</string>
  <string id="6052355">I'll handle this!</string>
  <string id="6052359">Get out of the way!</string>
  <string id="6052360">Incoming!</string>
  <string id="6052364">Watch your back!</string>
  <string id="6052365">They'll come from behind!</string>
  <string id="6052369">Watch out!</string>
  <string id="6052370">Brace yourselves! Here comes the storm!</string>
  <string id="6052374">Don't mind me. It's just a flesh wound.</string>
  <string id="6052375">I could use some bandages or a strong drink.</string>
  <string id="6052376">Didn't you say this would be easy and painless?</string>
  <string id="6052377">I'm all right. Who needs kidneys anyway?</string>
  <string id="6052378">Why do I keep getting into these scrapes?</string>
  <string id="6052382">We work well together.</string>
  <string id="6052383">I'm glad I don't have to clean up this mess.</string>
  <string id="6052384">Let this be a lesson to future generations.</string>
  <string id="6052385">And they say violence doesn't solve anything.</string>
  <string id="6052386">I can't take credit for all of this. Hawke helped a little bit.</string>
  <string id="6052390">Groans I need a drink.</string>
  <string id="6052391">Let's not do that again.</string>
  <string id="6052392">I need a good, long sleep when I get home.</string>
  <string id="6052393">I should've picked a different hobby.</string>
  <string id="6052394">Why me? Why's it always me?</string>
  <string id="6052398">Would you also like me to make pigs fly?</string>
  <string id="6052399">I'd like to, sweet thing, but I can't.</string>
  <string id="6052400">If only that were possible.</string>
  <string id="6052404">Trap ahead.</string>
  <string id="6052405">Watch your step.</string>
  <string id="6052406">Tread lightly around here.</string>
  <string id="6052410">You're such a slave-driver.</string>
  <string id="6052411">It's done.</string>
  <string id="6052412">You happy now?</string>
  <string id="6052416">I can handle that.</string>
  <string id="6052417">Should I give it a go?</string>
  <string id="6052418">Allow me.</string>
  <string id="6052555">Let's go. This is only the beginning.</string>
  <string id="6052558">Well, we're off to a fantastic start. Let's see what else this city has in store.</string>
  <string id="6052561">No further, human! Tal-Vashoth control these passages.</string>
  <string id="6052564">I seek no trouble; I meant to warn you. But you are no caravan—you are tracking.</string>
  <string id="6052567">So I see. I expected to warn a caravan, not a well-equipped tracker.</string>
  <string id="6052587">I'll check it out. You keep interrogating that horse.</string>
  <string id="6052588">What would you do without me?</string>
  <string id="6052598">They've raised the bloody dead. They must be truly desperate.</string>
  <string id="6052601">Please tell me we're not going to force these poor fools back into the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6052605">Templars. And I'm guessing not from Thrask.</string>
  <string id="6052615">Looks like more of Decimus's handiwork. Stand clear.</string>
  <string id="6052656">Formari Herbalist</string>
  <string id="6052658">Formari Herbalist</string>
  <string id="6052660">Formari Herbalist</string>
  <string id="6052662">Formari Herbalist</string>
  <string id="6052664">Formari Herbalist</string>
  <string id="6052734">Long Way Home</string>
  <string id="6052737">Deliver Flemeth's amulet to Keeper Marethari in the Dalish camp on Sundermount.</string>
  <string id="6052744">More corpses. Decimus was truly ready for a siege.</string>
  <string id="6052745">Looks like we missed a few.</string>
  <string id="6052746">I don't suppose we can just ask nicely if they'll please move?</string>
  <string id="6052747">These mages—there's no end to their crimes.</string>
  <string id="6052748">More undead. </string>
  <string id="6052751">We should have killed these mages. They are beyond salvation.</string>
  <string id="6052752">There's no end to these things!</string>
  <string id="6052753">Templars! And I don't think they're friendly ones!</string>
  <string id="6052754">Ser Karras's men are on their way. And they don't look ready to stop and chat.</string>
  <string id="6052755">Ser Karras's men seem to have arrived.</string>
  <string id="6052756">Templars ahead! And not from Thrask.</string>
  <string id="6052757">Looks like Thrask's friends came to the party early.</string>
  <string id="6052758">Templars. This mess is about to get far worse.</string>
  <string id="6052759">By Andraste! Is this... blood magic?</string>
  <string id="6052762">Only one way out for these mages now.</string>
  <string id="6052763">The corpses are stirring!</string>
  <string id="6052766">These mages are less innocent than our friend Thrask would like to believe.</string>
  <string id="6052767">They have raised the dead to defend them.</string>
  <string id="6052770">They are ready to die rather than return.</string>
  <string id="6052771">What in the bloody blight are these? The mages raised the dead!</string>
  <string id="6052772">Mages will always resort to the forbidden if they feel enough need.</string>
  <string id="6052773">I don't think those are men in the shadows. They're corpses.</string>
  <string id="6052776">These mages must have raised them to defend themselves. That's ghastly!</string>
  <string id="6052777">Who is he?</string>
  <string id="6052778">He?</string>
  <string id="6052780">Vincento's Northern Merchandise</string>
  <string id="6052807">Looter</string>
  <string id="6052830">Robes, straight ahead! Karras says to make sure there's no survivors.</string>
  <string id="6052833">I'll make sure the way out is clear.</string>
  <string id="6052838">Grey Warden</string>
  <string id="6052842">Stroud</string>
  <string id="6052845">Uh, yes. Yes, I was just about to tell him.</string>
  <string id="6052893">Bethany</string>
  <string id="6052897">Carver</string>
  <string id="6052902">Never know when you'll need one of these...</string>
  <string id="6052907">I dislike this place, but that dwarf, especially so.</string>
  <string id="6052908">I should let this continue? Let them wallow?</string>
  <string id="6052909">This city exists only to defile itself.</string>
  <string id="6052910">So few examples of true purpose. Or even character.</string>
  <string id="6052911">A selfish lot. They would welcome purpose.</string>
  <string id="6052912">Kirkwall. Kirkwall. Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6052913">We have a purpose, but when it's done, do we leave Kirkwall like this?</string>
  <string id="6052917">The cowardly bastard quit the battlefield after throwing his followers at us. You need to stop him.</string>
  <string id="6052920">Right. We, ah, told your men he ran out the back and they went after him. </string>
  <string id="6052923">Your men are in pursuit. </string>
  <string id="6052930">We can still catch up if we go around the caverns. That's the faster route.</string>
  <string id="6052935">Bethany</string>
  <string id="6052939">Carver</string>
  <string id="6052944">Those blighted apostates have been nothing but trouble.</string>
  <string id="6052945">We should have killed that whole Starkhaven crew before they got their fangs into the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6052951">All mages are confined to their quarters.</string>
  <string id="6052952">The knight-commander has sent to Val Royeaux for the Right of Annulment.</string>
  <string id="6052953">Those robes are gonna get their lesson. Soon.</string>
  <string id="6052957">These mages are getting bolder by the day.</string>
  <string id="6052958">The viscount won't even listen to the knight-commander. All he cares about is the heathens.</string>
  <string id="6052959">As soon as the Qunari are gone, the mages will make their move. Mark my words.</string>
  <string id="6052976">Hubert! Now you show up? We watched our brothers die, all for your blighted pit!</string>
  <string id="6052979">How dare you! Without me, you would have starved to death in the gutters of Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6052982">That's better than filling a monster's belly!</string>
  <string id="6052992">It just keeps getting worse.</string>
  <string id="6052993">Everyone's too scared of the Qunari to look at what it's like for us.</string>
  <string id="6052994">I-I think the knight-commander's crazy. They say she hears voices.</string>
  <string id="6052998">They got Grace and the others. Brought them back here.</string>
  <string id="6052999">Three of the Starkhaven mages were made Tranquil. I hear they picked at random.</string>
  <string id="6053000">Grace has them fooled, but I know she's still plotting to get out of here. As soon as she can.</string>
  <string id="6053003">I can't believe you got Grace to turn herself in.</string>
  <string id="6053004">The templars won't let me send mail out. I found a letter to my parents that they burned in the furnace.</string>
  <string id="6053008">I wonder how Grace is doing. Do you think they got away?</string>
  <string id="6053009">The templars sent a twenty-man unit to scour the countryside for the Starkhaven mages. They'll never let them go.</string>
  <string id="6053010">I hope Grace and the others have made it to Ferelden by now. I wish I was with them!</string>
  <string id="6053011">Starkhaven was never like this. The templars beat us and no one says a thing.</string>
  <string id="6053012">Ser Karras said if tell anyone he's been in my chambers, he'll make me Tranquil.</string>
  <string id="6053015">Imbeciles! How could I predict the dragons would return? You bark like you are the only ones who lost something.</string>
  <string id="6053022">Speak to Hubert about the missing shipments. He's in Hightown's market by day.</string>
  <string id="6053026">See Hubert in Hightown's market by day to interrogate Sabin.</string>
  <string id="6053027">Stop the next cargo ambush.</string>
  <string id="6053028">Kill the thugs responsible for the cargo thefts.</string>
  <string id="6053029">Meet Lilley in Darktown.</string>
  <string id="6053030">Meet Lilley in Darktown.</string>
  <string id="6053033">Find Brekker's Darktown hideout.</string>
  <string id="6053034">Return to Hubert with news of Brekker's death. Hubert is in Hightown's market by day.</string>
  <string id="6053035">Hubert was glad to hear there will be no more thefts.&#13;
</string>
  <string id="6053037">Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
I found a lead on our cargo thefts and have urgent need of your expertise. Please meet me in Hightown's market during business hours. &#13;
&#13;
Hubert</string>
  <string id="6053049">Throwing accusations around doesn't help anyone.</string>
  <string id="6053050">Let's calm down.</string>
  <string id="6053060">Are we are supposed to believe that you had no part in his actions?</string>
  <string id="6053063">She won't admit it, but it's obvious she's just as corrupted.</string>
  <string id="6053066">She's lying.</string>
  <string id="6053069">I swear to you, I have had no truck with demons.</string>
  <string id="6053074">Keran</string>
  <string id="6053079">Search the slavers' bodies for clues to where they sent Feynriel.</string>
  <string id="6053087">Yes. They found us. I'm sure you're not surprised.</string>
  <string id="6053090">After you turned us loose with no aid, no food, only a moment's head start...</string>
  <string id="6053093">Where else could we end up?</string>
  <string id="6053094">It's even worse here than I thought. Decimus was right. We should have died before submitting.</string>
  <string id="6053095">Three years on the run, living in the woods, eating carrion... and still we end up here.</string>
  <string id="6053096">Did you help them? You must have told them you let us go. Why else would they have hunted us so long?</string>
  <string id="6053100">They're getting worse. Now they deny us our grimoires, our staffs.</string>
  <string id="6053103">How are we to resist demons when they take all the tools of magic away from us?</string>
  <string id="6053104">Every day, they bring back the corpse of some poor mage who made a try for freedom.</string>
  <string id="6053107">I wonder how long they'll let me live.</string>
  <string id="6053111">You should have killed us in those caverns.</string>
  <string id="6053112">Decimus told me how bad the Kirkwall Circle was. It's my own fault I didn't believe him.</string>
  <string id="6053113">I should have fought you and those templars with the last breath in my body.</string>
  <string id="6053132">To think I didn't believe Jansen. You motherless bastard! I'll rip out your shriveled heart!</string>
  <string id="6053150">They say your life flashes in front of your eyes before you die.</string>
  <string id="6053151">Fear will help you remember.</string>
  <string id="6053161">You're not going to kill me in broad daylight. No one's that stupid.</string>
  <string id="6053168">You will leave as well, human. There's no more coin for you here.</string>
  <string id="6053174">Champion, talk some sense into your countrymen before they get themselves killed. I would rather not have to train new workers.</string>
  <string id="6053180">Hubert, I'll leave you to your problem.</string>
  <string id="6053181">It's your mess. Deal with it.</string>
  <string id="6053182">What you've done is indefensible. Stand down or face me.</string>
  <string id="6053183">The workers are right.</string>
  <string id="6053184">I see movement! Karras says we kill them all.</string>
  <string id="6053186">Sorry, Hubert. You can't pay me enough to cross swords with the Champion of Kirkwall and slayer of dragons.</string>
  <string id="6053189">No wait! I will double your pay... triple!</string>
  <string id="6053194">We've completed our investigation of the mages in those caverns. There is no one left inside.</string>
  <string id="6053200">No! We can make a deal! How would you all like to be my partners?</string>
  <string id="6053206">Screams</string>
  <string id="6053216">Ilen's Crafts</string>
  <string id="6053229">So I get nothing for all this work?</string>
  <string id="6053232">If anything, we have been denied the righteous application of the wisdom of the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6053235">What payment should I exact for that? Go, dwarf, before I begin my tally.</string>
  <string id="6053243">A letter from the viscount arrived recently. It must concern a matter of importance to Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6053254">Grace? We saved you. What are you doing?</string>
  <string id="6053255">Grace, do you really want to do this? After everything we've done for you?</string>
  <string id="6053263">Aveline?</string>
  <string id="6053269">I've been given an assignment. It involves the Qunari, and... I need your help.</string>
  <string id="6053270">What kind of assignment? I'll help if I can.</string>
  <string id="6053271">What can I do?</string>
  <string id="6053272">What else is new? I'm very popular these days.</string>
  <string id="6053273">Everyone needs my help.</string>
  <string id="6053275">I'd wondered how long it would take to come to violence.</string>
  <string id="6053276">You need to kill them?</string>
  <string id="6053277">No, it's not that. Not yet, anyway.</string>
  <string id="6053280">A number of criminals have fled to the Qunari Compound. They claim to have converted to their... religion.</string>
  <string id="6053283">The Qunari have of course refused to release them to the guard. I've been tasked with bringing them out.</string>
  <string id="6053286">The Arishok... he seems to respect you. Will you help present this matter to him?</string>
  <string id="6053287">Isn't it odd that anyone would run to the Qunari?</string>
  <string id="6053288">Who are these fugitives?</string>
  <string id="6053289">They're elves accused of murder. Perhaps they feel they've nothing to lose by fleeing the alienage.</string>
  <string id="6053292">Certainly their prospects can't get much worse, but their conversion is too convenient. The Qunari have to see that.</string>
  <string id="6053305">I... don't know. But how many more will try the same if I allow this? Justice must be respected.</string>
  <string id="6053309">You're expecting trouble, aren't you?</string>
  <string id="6053310">What will happen?</string>
  <string id="6053311">After what happened to the viscount's son? Yes.</string>
  <string id="6053314">I'm hoping the Qunari aren't looking for a fight. I'm hoping they'll be reasonable. But we'll see.</string>
  <string id="6053315">This seems like it warrants a larger response.</string>
  <string id="6053316">Why did they ask you?</string>
  <string id="6053317">Sending a patrol would be a significant escalation. I'm the captain. It's my responsibility.</string>
  <string id="6053320">But... I suspect the viscount was hoping I would bring this to you.</string>
  <string id="6053326">Perhaps, but he can be forgiven if he is not in his best mind. He's in mourning, and I'd like to help him, if I can.</string>
  <string id="6053327">Whatever I can do to help.</string>
  <string id="6053328">Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6053329">I'll have your back, don't worry.</string>
  <string id="6053330">Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6053331">I am very relieved to hear that.</string>
  <string id="6053332">Why not? Sounds like fun.</string>
  <string id="6053333">Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6053337">Do you need to do it right now?</string>
  <string id="6053338">Can it wait?</string>
  <string id="6053339">Not now, but soon.</string>
  <string id="6053342">It's not my business to go around arresting people.</string>
  <string id="6053343">I'm not in the city guard.</string>
  <string id="6053344">People look up to you. Even some Qunari, as far as I can tell with them.</string>
  <string id="6053347">The Qunari are very tall.</string>
  <string id="6053350">You know what I mean.</string>
  <string id="6053353">Just come with me to the compound. Decide when we know what's really at stake.</string>
  <string id="6053359">And... thank you, Hawke. I appreciate this.</string>
  <string id="6053372">What a bloody mess.</string>
  <string id="6053375">Thank you for dealing with the dragons. As promised, you are the majority owner of the Bone Pit now.</string>
  <string id="6053382">I will go draw up the paperwork. Men, leave the corpses to the crows.</string>
  <string id="6053400">What would you like to do?</string>
  <string id="6053401">Choose a hostage</string>
  <string id="6053402">Choose a hostage</string>

  <string id="6053431">Coin can be earned again, but the lives lost can never be restored.</string>
  <string id="6053432">I'm taking over as mine boss.</string>
  <string id="6053461">You didn't speak with Lilley the Knife about protection for the Bone Pit. Hubert will have to handle the situation himself.</string>
  <string id="6053473">We need to find the viscount, and quickly.</string>
  <string id="6053479">There's more coming!</string>
  <string id="6053482">Go. We'll deal with them.</string>
  <string id="6053488">Find Viscount Dumar and ensure his safety.</string>
  <string id="6053489">Oh! Hawke! Thanks for helping me with that little problem I had.</string>
  <string id="6053495">Go to the Qunari Compound by the Docks to see if Saemus went voluntarily.</string>
  <string id="6053498">You lied to me, but we caught these apostates anyway.</string>
  <string id="6053499">Jump to the keep</string>
  <string id="6053500">Jump to the keep</string>
  <string id="6053501">Ready?</string>
  <string id="6053502">Go!</string>
  <string id="6053503">Go!</string>
  <string id="6053504">Exit</string>
  <string id="6053505">Exit</string>
  <string id="6053510">Aren't you that mage-lady whose ass we saved?</string>
  <string id="6053513">Grace. I had a feeling you weren't the grateful type.</string>
  <string id="6053516">Hmph. A mage is a snake in the grass that will turn on you every time.</string>
  <string id="6053519">Grace? Wasn't she one of the mages you freed maybe six years ago?</string>
  <string id="6053525">Grace. I knew we should have let the templars slay her.</string>
  <string id="6053528">Grace? Wasn't she one of the mages you turned in almost six years ago?</string>
  <string id="6053531">I've been waiting six years to see how you'd try to get revenge for going to the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6053534">Hey... aren't you that mage-lady whose ass we sent to the Circle?</string>
  <string id="6053537">Grace, don't do this. The Champion didn't realize what you would suffer at the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6053540">Grace, don't do this. We should never have sent you to the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6053546">I was a good templar once. The old knight-commander, he gave me my sun-shield personally.</string>
  <string id="6053547">It's all that bitch Meredith. She's the one that threw me on the streets.</string>
  <string id="6053548">If I were in the Order again, with dust coming regular, no one would look at me like this.</string>
  <string id="6053549">I hear you fought through half the darkspawn horde to come back with them treasures.</string>
  <string id="6053552">I don't got that in me. Not anymore.</string>
  <string id="6053555">All I got is the thirst and the dust.</string>
  <string id="6053563">Where's my property, huh? How's it feel making a profit off someone else's hard work?</string>
  <string id="6053564">I'm not here to kill you, but if you tell me what this is about, I might be able to help.</string>
  <string id="6053565">Can I help with your troubles?</string>
  <string id="6053566">Not speaking from personal experience, but I'm sure it feels great not to have to work to earn your keep.</string>
  <string id="6053567">Good?</string>
  <string id="6053568">You bastards. Well, I'm not going down without a fight!</string>
  <string id="6053569">Flinging accusations around blindly is a sure way to get yourself killed.</string>
  <string id="6053570">Watch who you're accusing.</string>
  <string id="6053571">What is this? You looking out for me now?</string>
  <string id="6053577">Wait—I get it. You're not a raider. Raiders don't talk, they just do the deed, and leave.</string>
  <string id="6053581">Oh. Chuckles I knew I could count on that girl.</string>
  <string id="6053588">This could turn out well for both of us. If you're not here to end me, maybe you could help me instead.</string>
  <string id="6053591">I need someone to help me find out where the raiders have hidden my stolen cargo.</string>
  <string id="6053592">Why would the raiders want your cargo? Is it valuable?</string>
  <string id="6053593">What's the cargo?</string>
  <string id="6053594">How should I know why they want it? It's just spices and herbs. Nothing special.</string>
  <string id="6053595">Sighs Isabela doesn't know how to keep her mouth shut, does she?</string>
  <string id="6053600">Are you going with me to the Qunari Compound? If so, we'll need to do it soon before this gets out of hand.</string>
  <string id="6053603">I'd rather they feared me.</string>
  <string id="6053606">Fine, but it won't happen sitting here.</string>
  <string id="6053670">Imagine that! We'll be owners!</string>
  <string id="6053676">Be a lot of work to get this mine running again. First, we gotta get the injured back on their feet.</string>
  <string id="6053682">No more taking orders from that Orlesian bastard! We'll be working for one of our own, now.</string>
  <string id="6053685">I guess the Bone Pit's yours now. What are your plans?</string>
  <string id="6053686">The miners know how to run this place. I'll make you all co-owners.</string>
  <string id="6053687">How'd you like to be partners?</string>
  <string id="6053688">You and your fellows can have this blighted pit. I never want to come back here again.</string>
  <string id="6053689">I'm through with this place.</string>
  <string id="6053693">If you'll continue working the mines, I promise to treat you better than Hubert did.</string>
  <string id="6053694">I'll be your new boss.</string>
  <string id="6053697">Aye, this place is cursed. Let's just walk away and never look back.</string>
  <string id="6053711">I hired someone to post fliers in the refugee camps, so we shall have new workers before long.</string>
  <string id="6053728">I, eh, convinced the city guard to... overlook what happened at the Bone Pit.</string>
  <string id="6053731">The papers are in order. You will run the Bone Pit in my stead.</string>
  <string id="6053744">The papers are in order. The miners will run the Bone Pit themselves.</string>
  <string id="6053747">I never should have gotten involved with that cursed mine.</string>
  <string id="6053750">For now, I am refocusing on mercantile as my primary business. I have some new items it stock.</string>
  <string id="6053779">Champion! I didn't think anyone was coming.</string>
  <string id="6053784">The dragons caught us by surprise, coming down from the mountains.</string>
  <string id="6053793">Robart, my best lieutenant, was watching for them, but... he's missing.</string>
  <string id="6053825">What happened here?</string>
  <string id="6053851">The path ahead is littered with my kind. If you are as skilled as you look, it would please me if you killed them.</string>
  <string id="6053852">You have turned your back on your kin?</string>
  <string id="6053853">Are you a traitor?</string>
  <string id="6053854">Yes. For a second time.</string>
  <string id="6053857">And I should trust you?</string>
  <string id="6053860">I have no history of betraying your people. Only my own.</string>
  <string id="6053863">I did not like my role, so I left the Qun. I do not wish to be a murdering thief, so I left these Tal-Vashoth to warn their victims.</string>
  <string id="6053873">Is this Qunari courage?</string>
  <string id="6053874">No stomach for a fight?</string>
  <string id="6053875">I am not Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6053878">Well you're no dwarf.</string>
  <string id="6053881">Qunari are of the Qun. I am Tal-Vashoth.</string>
  <string id="6053884">So are the others, but they murder and steal, and I won't. So I warned you. Now I will leave.</string>
  <string id="6053885">If they have offended you so much, help me go after them.</string>
  <string id="6053886">Join me to fight them.</string>
  <string id="6053887">But I am worse.</string>
  <string id="6053893">They don't want to raise their swords for coin, so they murder and steal. They cling to the honor they held under the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6053896">My sword means nothing. I will sell it, and myself, as mercenary. Qunari would say I am worse.</string>
  <string id="6053897">If your blade is on the market, I'll pay.</string>
  <string id="6053898">Then I will hire you.</string>
  <string id="6053899">You have my word of caution, human. Heed it or do not.</string>
  <string id="6053911">What's the trick, Tal-Vashoth?</string>
  <string id="6053912">I don't believe you.</string>
  <string id="6053915">I did not intend to ambush. I expected to warn a caravan, but you are not helpless.</string>
  <string id="6053919">You endanger yourself, human! Do not say you were unwarned!</string>
  <string id="6053922">Another friend we haven't met.</string>
  <string id="6053923">Here we go again.</string>
  <string id="6053924">I don't even wake Bianca for every threat anymore.</string>
  <string id="6053925">On your guard.</string>
  <string id="6053926">Here we go again.</string>
  <string id="6053927">Led us right into another... something.</string>
  <string id="6053928">Qunari? Tal-Vashoth.</string>
  <string id="6053929">Oh dear. Why doesn't anyone ever want to be nice to us?</string>
  <string id="6053931">If you're looking for trouble, you've found it!</string>
  <string id="6053934">I am more than capable of meeting any threat.</string>
  <string id="6053939">Ambushes are usually quieter, Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6053946">You are no victim, so now I will leave.</string>
  <string id="6053950">The path ahead is thick with my kind. They revel in chaos and will give you the battle you appear to want.</string>
  <string id="6053953">If telling you that is a trick, it is a poor one.</string>
  <string id="6053956">I am new to decisions outside my role, human. I have decided to warn you. Do what you will.</string>
  <string id="6053987">Qunari</string>
  <string id="6053989">Qunari Compound</string>
  <string id="6053995">Karasaad</string>
  <string id="6053999">Qunari Honor Guard</string>
  <string id="6054006">An awkward time to run off, Isabela.</string>
  <string id="6054007">You'd leave me short handed?</string>
  <string id="6054008">Aw, you know I'd never leave you. It's just that I really have to leave. Now.</string>
  <string id="6054012">Arianni was looking for you. Feynriel is trapped in a nightmare. Even the first enchanter can't wake him up.</string>
  <string id="6054013">Have you spoken to Arianni? She was frantic. Some news about Feynriel.</string>
  <string id="6054014">Feynriel awoke from his nightmare. The first enchanter says it is as if the magic inside him was released.</string>
  <string id="6054017">He is petitioning for Feynriel to be sent to the Imperium for training.</string>
  <string id="6054018">Something happened while Feynriel was in the Fade. He awoke with his connection severed.</string>
  <string id="6054021">He is Tranquil.</string>
  <string id="6054024">Arianni took poison rather than see him like that.</string>
  <string id="6054025">Feynriel has escaped. </string>
  <string id="6054028">The first enchanter fears he has fallen to demonic possession.</string>
  <string id="6054031">The templars are assembling a team to hunt him now.</string>
  <string id="6054032">The knight-commander found Grace and the other Starkhaven mages.</string>
  <string id="6054035">They are still in quarantine.</string>
  <string id="6054036">I think Grace trusts me. I am the only templar she tolerates near her people.</string>
  <string id="6054037">This isn't how it should be. Templars protect mages. We should stand together, against demons, not fight among ourselves.</string>
  <string id="6054040">Before Meredith, things were different.</string>
  <string id="6054044">Thank you for your assistance with the Starkhaven apostates.</string>
  <string id="6054045">I'm sorry, but Feynriel is allowed no visitors at this time.</string>
  <string id="6054046">I have no further news of Feynriel. I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6054047">Meredith ordered three Starkhaven mages executed at random. To teach them a lesson.</string>
  <string id="6054050">I'm afraid they've learned all too well.</string>
  <string id="6054051">Grace has been preaching to the Circle mages, telling them it is better to be dead and free.</string>
  <string id="6054054">I wonder if it was a mistake to bring her here at all.</string>
  <string id="6054057">It is far harder to hide it from myself...</string>
  <string id="6054058">The knight-commander will not give up on finding the Starkhaven mages. She has ordered a dozen men to sweep the countryside.</string>
  <string id="6054059">The mages here were all told the Starkhaven mages were killed during escape. </string>
  <string id="6054062">It only makes them more determined to follow.</string>
  <string id="6054068">Feynriel will get used to the Circle. It's the best place for him.</string>
  <string id="6054069">I'm sorry you couldn't find Feynriel. Nothing good can have come to him.</string>
  <string id="6054077">Since she stepped into the viscount's shoes, Meredith has forgotten her duties to the templars.</string>
  <string id="6054078">The first enchanter is right. Templars were not meant to hold worldly power.</string>
  <string id="6054079">I know you supported the first enchanter when he spoke out against Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6054080">Hey, whoa! I'm not who you think I am, and I'm certainly not here to kill you.</string>
  <string id="6054083">You're not trying to kill me? Makes sense. If you were, you wouldn't be talking.</string>
  <string id="6054099">I hope you will be ready should it come to picking sides.</string>
  <string id="6054100">I know you spoke for Meredith in the square.</string>
  <string id="6054103">Do you truly think Kirkwall benefits from her command?</string>
  <string id="6054129">I'll guard this path. Please, see to the survivors.</string>
  <string id="6054153">You're not here to kill me? And you want to help? Maker, it's got to be my lucky day.</string>
  <string id="6054173">Mercenary</string>
  <string id="6054181">Maker be with you, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6054183">What did the raiders do to you?</string>
  <string id="6054184">How did you lose the cargo?</string>
  <string id="6054185">They closed in on my ship and forced her into the cliffs. My crew and I barely made it out alive.</string>
  <string id="6054188">They must have salvaged the cargo when it washed ashore.</string>
  <string id="6054200">He's escaped. That's reason enough to catch him.</string>
  <string id="6054206">There is something, yes. There are... creatures, in the ruins. The guards I sent are ill-equipped to deal with such beasts.</string>
  <string id="6054222">Champion, you're here! Jansen's asking for you. I fear he don't have long.</string>
  <string id="6054227">Didn't I save your life?</string>
  <string id="6054228">Keran?</string>
  <string id="6054229">You did. Believe me, I still dream about those blood mages. I don't know where I'd be without you.</string>
  <string id="6054232">I'd never have let them kidnap anyone I knew was one of yours.</string>
  <string id="6054237">What are you going to do to Thrask? To me?</string>
  <string id="6054241">Ah, Jansen. I'll drink a pint for you, my friend.</string>
  <string id="6054244">If Hubert knew those dragons were coming... I'll crack his head open!</string>
  <string id="6054253">The Arishok was slain in a duel and the remainder of the Qunari left Kirkwall. The city has been saved.</string>
  <string id="6054259">Best of luck. We're all depending on you.</string>
  <string id="6054263">It's fancy. Just like everything Orlesian.</string>
  <string id="6054266">I've had it with the raiders, and this cargo is the key to me getting on the straight and narrow.</string>
  <string id="6054269">You're doing me a huge favor here, friend. Thank you, and be careful.</string>
  <string id="6054270">Tal-Vashoth Mercenary</string>
  <string id="6054288">I'm guessing you don't mean my ability to juggle small rodents to Orlesian ballads?</string>
  <string id="6054289">My special talents?</string>
  <string id="6054290">If that is your greatest skill, then I have been misinformed... I'm looking for muscle, not... whatever it was you were just describing. </string>
  <string id="6054295">Not only will you be well-paid, you'll have the gratitude of a city magistrate. Useful for a refugee, wouldn't you agree?</string>
  <string id="6054298">This job's as easy as a peg-legged tavern wench, and there's good coin in it to boot.</string>
  <string id="6054303">Hawke Estate</string>
  <string id="6054310">The Arishok's assault ended with every Qunari being slain in the Keep. Kirkwall has been saved.</string>
  <string id="6054311">Very funny, Isabela. You said you could find me help. This is the best you could do, huh?</string>
  <string id="6054359">Oh there you are! I was so worried about you!</string>
  <string id="6054362">You're safe. Thank the Maker, I thought they got you.</string>
  <string id="6054365">Can you hear it? The Qunari must be spreading out. They're attacking the city!</string>
  <string id="6054368">Why? What could they possibly hope to accomplish?</string>
  <string id="6054369">You heard the Arishok. He's done playing nice, and damn the consequences.</string>
  <string id="6054370">They're starting a war.</string>
  <string id="6054371">It doesn't matter—we need to act.</string>
  <string id="6054372">We have to do something.</string>
  <string id="6054373">I agree. We can't do anything on our own, however.</string>
  <string id="6054374">Somehow, I don't think the Arishok cares what happens after this.</string>
  <string id="6054375">I'm not sure that matters.</string>
  <string id="6054376">You may be right.</string>
  <string id="6054379">Whatever it is, we need to do something quickly. But we'll need some help.</string>
  <string id="6054380">Is this whole thing to oust the knight-commander?</string>
  <string id="6054381">Is this all about Meredith?</string>
  <string id="6054382">She needs to go. Don't you see? </string>
  <string id="6054385">We need a real viscount, and templars who protect mages, not massacre them.</string>
  <string id="6054388">Just look what Thrask accomplished! Mages and templars, working together. Isn't that what we all want?</string>
  <string id="6054389">Is Thrask the one running this conspiracy?</string>
  <string id="6054390">Who's in charge?</string>
  <string id="6054391">He's the one who brought us together.</string>
  <string id="6054394">For six years, he's been working—one mage, one templar at a time. Teaching us we don't have to hate each other.</string>
  <string id="6054397">He showed us Meredith isn't the only way.</string>
  <string id="6054400">Evelina</string>

  <string id="6054467">Find Huon</string>

  <string id="6054491">Discreet? Her?</string>
  <string id="6054492">You think she's discreet? Look at that cleavage!</string>

  <string id="6055206">It's him that did this to Cordelia. He needs to pay.</string>
  <string id="6055207">Darktown is dangerous. If I'm risking my neck, there will be compensation, right?</string>
  <string id="6055208">Is there a reward?</string>

  <string id="6055402">The guard walking in so bold, but Shadow came.</string>
  <string id="6055405">Said in a raspy rasp, Kill her! And then Booker's thugs stabbed the guard. Ha-ha!</string>

  <string id="6055427">Do it. Kill me. Slit my throat. That's the only way the whispers will stop. I asked my father to do it, but he wouldn't.</string>
  <string id="6055430">He didn't tell you, did he? The magistrate is my father.</string>
  <string id="6055433">He’s tried so hard to keep me—and what I've done—hidden away.</string>
  <string id="6055434">The magistrate's more worried about keeping his job than doing his job. </string>
  <string id="6055435">He's protecting his position.</string>
  <string id="6055436">I'm not here to discuss the magistrate.</string>
  <string id="6055437">I don't care.</string>
  <string id="6055438">The magistrate is supposed to protect the people of the city, and that includes the elves.</string>
  <string id="6055439">He's ignoring his duties.</string>
  <string id="6055440">Father is a good man. He tried to help, to stop me. But he can't... no one can.</string>
  <string id="6055443">That elf girl. She had no right to be so beautiful, so perfect. The demons said she needed to be taught a lesson, like all the others.</string>
  <string id="6055447">Let me get this straight. You torture and murder elven children for being too beautiful?</string>
  <string id="6055448">That's why you kill them?</string>
  <string id="6055449">I... I didn't want to hurt them. They force me! The demons don't like it when they cry.</string>
  <string id="6055516">Is the Arishok impressed of the player?</string>
  <string id="6055517">Yes</string>
  <string id="6055518">Yes</string>
  <string id="6055519">No</string>
  <string id="6055520">No</string>
  <string id="6055527">Lowtown</string>
  <string id="6055529">Darktown</string>
  <string id="6055531">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6055535">Docks</string>
  <string id="6055537">Coterie Thug</string>
  <string id="6055539">Coterie Thug</string>
  <string id="6055567">Sometimes I think their brains are twisted up in those horns of theirs.</string>
  <string id="6055568">As long as I live, I will not understand the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6055569">The more they talk, the less I understand.</string>
  <string id="6055570">As twisted as their horns.</string>
  <string id="6055571">I just... do not understand them.</string>
  <string id="6055572">What in the Void is wrong with these things?</string>
  <string id="6055573">Qunari and Tal-Vashoth remain... challenging to understand.</string>
  <string id="6055574">Sometimes I wonder what goes on inside their heads.</string>
  <string id="6055578">Charming as always.</string>
  <string id="6055579">I just don't understand the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6055580">Bah! There's danger ahead and fire is hot.</string>
  <string id="6055581">Take warnings where you find them.</string>
  <string id="6055582">Was that normal? For them, I mean.</string>
  <string id="6055583">Should have killed him. Right?</string>
  <string id="6055584">Unusual.</string>
  <string id="6055585">That was... strange.</string>
  <string id="6055593">The Circle was supposed to help me, but they lied! They said there were no demons, that I was mad. This isn't my fault.</string>
  <string id="6055594">I'm not getting paid enough for this.</string>
  <string id="6055595">What a headache.</string>
  <string id="6055596">If the Circle suspected a demon at work, they wouldn't risk setting you loose in the city.</string>
  <string id="6055597">I doubt the Circle lied.</string>
  <string id="6055598">No! They lied!</string>
  <string id="6055601">I can't stop. I've tried so many times. Please, you have to kill me. There's no other way.</string>
  <string id="6055604">He sees the truth of it. Allow me to grant his wish, if you will not.</string>
  <string id="6055605">Any last words before he kills you, Kelder?</string>
  <string id="6055606">He's all yours.</string>
  <string id="6055607">Tell my father... I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6055610">Gasps</string>
  <string id="6055613">Goodbye, Kelder.</string>
  <string id="6055614">No, I'll take care of it.</string>
  <string id="6055615">I'm sorry, Fenris. The magistrate wants him alive.</string>
  <string id="6055616">No, we have to take him in.</string>
  <string id="6055620">Just tell my father I'm sorry... for everything.</string>
  <string id="6055621">If nothing short of killing you will stop this, then so be it. Goodbye, Kelder.</string>
  <string id="6055622">This ends with your death.</string>
  <string id="6055623">The elves deserve justice. Breathe your last, monster. </string>
  <string id="6055624">This ends with your death.</string>
  <string id="6055625">Must you be so dramatic?</string>
  <string id="6055626">This ends with your death.</string>
  <string id="6055627">Gasps</string>
  <string id="6055630">Let the courts sort this out.</string>
  <string id="6055631">No. You're coming with me.</string>
  <string id="6055638">Don't like interruptions, not when this mark is so promising! Get them!</string>
  <string id="6055642">Gamlen's House</string>
  <string id="6055644">That's not what I meant!</string>
  <string id="6055669">Vishante.</string>
  <string id="6055670">Fenedhis.</string>
  <string id="6055671">Now we shall see.</string>
  <string id="6055672">A mark is made.</string>
  <string id="6055673">Kaffar!</string>
  <string id="6055674">You wish to fight?</string>
  <string id="6055675">Most unwise.</string>
  <string id="6055676">Alluvin valla kal.</string>
  <string id="6055677">Let us see.</string>
  <string id="6055678">We move again.</string>
  <string id="6055679">A thrust.</string>
  <string id="6055680">Now a parry.</string>
  <string id="6055681">An interesting tactic.</string>
  <string id="6055682">Again?</string>
  <string id="6055683">That was a mistake.</string>
  <string id="6055687">We must fight together!</string>
  <string id="6055688">Combine our efforts!</string>
  <string id="6055689">Attack this one!</string>
  <string id="6055693">Come to me!</string>
  <string id="6055694">We must regroup!</string>
  <string id="6055695">To me, my friends!</string>
  <string id="6055699">Time for something more useful, I think.</string>
  <string id="6055703">Time for a potion.</string>
  <string id="6055704">Benefaris.</string>
  <string id="6055705">Time for a quick drink.</string>
  <string id="6055715">I cannot move!</string>
  <string id="6055716">What's gotten hold of me?</string>
  <string id="6055717">Immobilized!</string>
  <string id="6055721">I cannot continue like this.</string>
  <string id="6055722">Kevesh!</string>
  <string id="6055723">I am beginning to tire.</string>
  <string id="6055733">Healing would be welcome!</string>
  <string id="6055734">I will not last, at this rate.</string>
  <string id="6055735">I am about to fall!</string>
  <string id="6055739">Another falls before me.</string>
  <string id="6055740">Rest, and be grateful.</string>
  <string id="6055741">That one shall not rise again.</string>
  <string id="6055742">One more is vanquished.</string>
  <string id="6055743">On to the next.</string>
  <string id="6055747">Curious.</string>
  <string id="6055748">My weapon does nothing?</string>
  <string id="6055749">Another tactic is required.</string>
  <string id="6055753">I must get closer.</string>
  <string id="6055754">I am too far away, I think.</string>
  <string id="6055755">Let us close the gap.</string>
  <string id="6055759">More enemies approach.</string>
  <string id="6055760">Be wary!</string>
  <string id="6055761">Nothing is ever easy.</string>
  <string id="6055765">And so it begins.</string>
  <string id="6055766">Shall we end this quickly?</string>
  <string id="6055767">Another battle is upon us.</string>
  <string id="6055768">More blood to be shed.</string>
  <string id="6055769">We shall not falter.</string>
  <string id="6055773">You have my thanks.</string>
  <string id="6055774">I fight again.</string>
  <string id="6055775">I rise from the brink of death.</string>
  <string id="6055776">This time I will not fail.</string>
  <string id="6055781">Another has fallen.</string>
  <string id="6055782">Unfortunate.</string>
  <string id="6055786">The mage is down.</string>
  <string id="6055790">Aveline has fallen?</string>
  <string id="6055794">Your sister has fallen.</string>
  <string id="6055798">Your brother has fallen.</string>
  <string id="6055806">Ahh, Isabela.</string>
  <string id="6055810">Surely we all saw that coming.</string>
  <string id="6055814">Now the dwarf falls.</string>
  <string id="6055818">This is not good.</string>
  <string id="6055822">Interesting.</string>
  <string id="6055826">No!</string>
  <string id="6055830">No! I will not allow it!</string>
  <string id="6055834">Is that the best you can do?</string>
  <string id="6055835">Ahh, a shame that you are going to die, no?</string>
  <string id="6055836">Surely you can't hope to best me.</string>
  <string id="6055840">I will aid you!</string>
  <string id="6055841">Stay fast!</string>
  <string id="6055842">Hold! I am coming!</string>
  <string id="6055846">It's about to attack!</string>
  <string id="6055847">Beware!</string>
  <string id="6055851">Watch out!</string>
  <string id="6055852">Watch the shadows!</string>
  <string id="6055856">Here it comes!</string>
  <string id="6055857">Take cover!</string>
  <string id="6055861">Ahh, this is not going to heal quickly.</string>
  <string id="6055862">We need to stop and rest when we've a moment.</string>
  <string id="6055863">I will need bandages soon.</string>
  <string id="6055864">I sustained an injury in the last battle.</string>
  <string id="6055865">My wounds need attention.</string>
  <string id="6055869">All done? Alas.</string>
  <string id="6055870">It seems we are victorious.</string>
  <string id="6055871">The enemies have fallen before us.</string>
  <string id="6055872">We have done well.</string>
  <string id="6055873">And we live another day.</string>
  <string id="6055877">And it all finished without me? Too bad.</string>
  <string id="6055878">It seems you have won the day. Well done.</string>
  <string id="6055879">That was most unpleasant.</string>
  <string id="6055880">Well, at least I'm not dead.</string>
  <string id="6055881">You carried the day. That's what matters.</string>
  <string id="6055885">That cannot be done.</string>
  <string id="6055886">Alas, no.</string>
  <string id="6055887">Think again.</string>
  <string id="6055891">Beware the trap.</string>
  <string id="6055892">Look there!</string>
  <string id="6055893">Take care! There is a trap.</string>
  <string id="6055897">It is done.</string>
  <string id="6055898">The task is finished.</string>
  <string id="6055899">I have done it.</string>
  <string id="6055903">Allow me.</string>
  <string id="6055904">If I may?</string>
  <string id="6055905">I can do that, if you wish.</string>
  <string id="6055961">For the People!</string>
  <string id="6055962">Vir enasalin!</string>
  <string id="6055963">Enough!</string>
  <string id="6055964">Oh, that's going to hurt!</string>
  <string id="6055965">Mythal'enaste!</string>
  <string id="6055966">Stand back!</string>
  <string id="6055967">May the Creators have mercy on you. I certainly won't.</string>
  <string id="6055968">Na melana sahlin!</string>
  <string id="6055969">What do you think you're doing?</string>
  <string id="6055970">No more!</string>
  <string id="6055971">May the Dread Wolf take you!</string>
  <string id="6055972">You'll get more than you bargained for!</string>
  <string id="6055973">Away with you!</string>
  <string id="6055974">Begone!</string>
  <string id="6055975">Just fall, already, you blighter!</string>
  <string id="6055979">Could somebody help me with this, please?</string>
  <string id="6055980">I do need a hand here...</string>
  <string id="6055981">Hello? Anybody? I'd really appreciate some help!</string>
  <string id="6055985">Over here, quickly!</string>
  <string id="6055986">Come to me!</string>
  <string id="6055987">I've got an idea! Get over here!</string>
  <string id="6055991">That should have worked! Why didn't that work? Blast it all, new plan!</string>
  <string id="6055995">I think this will help a little.</string>
  <string id="6055996">Ugh! This tastes terrible! What's in this, nightshade?</string>
  <string id="6055997">Bottoms up!</string>
  <string id="6056007">I can't move! Go on, I'll catch up!</string>
  <string id="6056008">Oh for the love of— I'm stuck!</string>
  <string id="6056009">By Andruil! I wish I'd worn proper shoes now...</string>
  <string id="6056019">Do you think they're tiring? I'm tiring...</string>
  <string id="6056020">I only have a little left...</string>
  <string id="6056021">I'm sorry... I can't do any more.</string>
  <string id="6056025">This is going very badly...</string>
  <string id="6056026">Ma tel'melana sahlin! Help! Please!</string>
  <string id="6056027">I'm a little overwhelmed here!</string>
  <string id="6056031">Enasalin!</string>
  <string id="6056032">Ir abelas!</string>
  <string id="6056033">Oh, I got one!</string>
  <string id="6056034">And stay down!</string>
  <string id="6056035">You brought this on yourself, you know!</string>
  <string id="6056039">Mythal'enaste! This is no good!</string>
  <string id="6056040">Does anyone know why nothing seems to be happening?</string>
  <string id="6056041">I really think we need a new plan!</string>
  <string id="6056045">Oh, I can't hit that! It's much too far!</string>
  <string id="6056046">I'd have to fly to reach! Of course, I've always wanted to learn to fly.</string>
  <string id="6056047">It's no good. I can barely even see it.</string>
  <string id="6056051">Oh dear, get ready for more trouble!</string>
  <string id="6056052">Lethallan! More are coming!</string>
  <string id="6056053">Things are about to get exciting!</string>
  <string id="6056057">Elgar'nan guide me, enemies come!</string>
  <string id="6056058">This doesn't seem very nice at all, does it?</string>
  <string id="6056059">I think... we'd better get ready to fight!</string>
  <string id="6056060">Everyone? We're about to be attacked.</string>
  <string id="6056061">The Keeper told me there would be days like this.</string>
  <string id="6056065">Ma serannas! Oh, that was close!</string>
  <string id="6056066">I really ought to practice... not getting hit more.</string>
  <string id="6056067">Oooh, the bits of me that weren't already black and blue are starting to turn.</string>
  <string id="6056068">I know Dalish are meant to be close to the earth, but we don't mean literally!</string>
  <string id="6056069">You're very kind, thank you.</string>
  <string id="6056073">We're being dragged down!</string>
  <string id="6056074">No!</string>
  <string id="6056078">Anders needs help!</string>
  <string id="6056082">By the Creators! Aveline has fallen?</string>
  <string id="6056086">Oh dear! We have to help Bethany!</string>
  <string id="6056090">Carver! Don't worry, we'll help you!</string>
  <string id="6056094">Ah, could someone pick up Fenris, please?</string>
  <string id="6056098">Isabela, can you hear me? Don't move, we're coming!</string>
  <string id="6056106">Varric, if you are faking, I will strangle you!</string>
  <string id="6056110">Hawke! Mythal'enaste!</string>
  <string id="6056114">Someone help Hawke!</string>
  <string id="6056118">Hawke, if you see any paths in the Fade, don't take them! Stay put!</string>
  <string id="6056122">Ma vhenan! Hold on!</string>
  <string id="6056126">Over here you... you... vile, mean... thing!</string>
  <string id="6056127">Hello, I'm Merrill, and I'll be your distraction. Neener, neener! You can't hit me!</string>
  <string id="6056128">I'm going to taunt you in elvish now! Durgen'len! Aravel! Vallaslin!</string>
  <string id="6056132">I'm on my way!</string>
  <string id="6056133">Be right there!</string>
  <string id="6056134">Don't worry, I'm coming to help!</string>
  <string id="6056138">Creators, that's a big one!</string>
  <string id="6056139">Keep your distance!</string>
  <string id="6056143">They'll strike from cover!</string>
  <string id="6056144">Watch your backs!</string>
  <string id="6056148">Get to safety!</string>
  <string id="6056149">This one will hurt!</string>
  <string id="6056153">Could I just lie down for a moment?</string>
  <string id="6056154">Oh, this doesn't look good at all...</string>
  <string id="6056155">Keeper Marethari, is that you? I don't feel so good...</string>
  <string id="6056156">Suledin. Suledin, tel'numin...</string>
  <string id="6056157">I... I can't make this stop bleeding.</string>
  <string id="6056161">I think it's over. Do you think it's over?</string>
  <string id="6056162">Is everyone all right?</string>
  <string id="6056163">My goodness! That was exciting!</string>
  <string id="6056164">You know, I think they were really trying to kill us?</string>
  <string id="6056165">I think that's enough of that.</string>
  <string id="6056169">I had the strangest dream... oh! Maybe it wasn't a dream. Never mind.</string>
  <string id="6056170">Could we, perhaps, do battle with a pack of pretty flowers or soft bunnies next time? I'd do much better.</string>
  <string id="6056171">That didn't go quite like I thought it would.</string>
  <string id="6056172">In the future, someone remind me that I don't like being pummeled.</string>
  <string id="6056173">I've got so many bruises now, they've got names and families.</string>
  <string id="6056177">What? I hope you're joking.</string>
  <string id="6056178">On the best day of my life, I couldn't manage that.</string>
  <string id="6056179">Um... no? Definitely not. Ever.</string>
  <string id="6056183">Watch out!</string>
  <string id="6056184">Someone's lain traps.</string>
  <string id="6056185">Nobody make a sudden moves!</string>
  <string id="6056189">That wasn't so bad!</string>
  <string id="6056190">Oh, that was fun!</string>
  <string id="6056191">All done!</string>
  <string id="6056195">May I help?</string>
  <string id="6056196">Oh! Let me!</string>
  <string id="6056197">I think I can do that.</string>
  <string id="6056253">Oh, this will be fun.</string>
  <string id="6056254">I'd run if I were you.</string>
  <string id="6056255">This is my favorite part!</string>
  <string id="6056256">Say your prayers!</string>
  <string id="6056257">I'll show you why mages are feared!</string>
  <string id="6056258">Destructive forces of nature, coming up.</string>
  <string id="6056259">For freedom!</string>
  <string id="6056260">Suck on a fireball!</string>
  <string id="6056261">I'm your worst nightmare.</string>
  <string id="6056262">Afraid yet?</string>
  <string id="6056263">You've messed with the wrong mage.</string>
  <string id="6056264">Never taunt a mage.</string>
  <string id="6056265">Run while you can.</string>
  <string id="6056266">My magic will destroy you.</string>
  <string id="6056267">Die, bastard!</string>
  <string id="6056271">Give me a hand!</string>
  <string id="6056272">I'm not omnipotent, you know!</string>
  <string id="6056273">Over here!</string>
  <string id="6056277">To me!</string>
  <string id="6056278">Everyone over here!</string>
  <string id="6056279">Regroup!</string>
  <string id="6056283">This is so not working.</string>
  <string id="6056287">This should help.</string>
  <string id="6056288">Ah, that hits the spot.</string>
  <string id="6056289">Another on the rocks, please.</string>
  <string id="6056299">Help! I can't move!</string>
  <string id="6056300">Over here!</string>
  <string id="6056301">Don't leave me behind.</string>
  <string id="6056305">I don't know how much more of this I can take.</string>
  <string id="6056306">This is wiping me out.</string>
  <string id="6056307">Can't... do... much more.</string>
  <string id="6056311">I'm losing my focus.</string>

  <string id="6056325">Victory!</string>
  <string id="6056326">Score one for our heroes.</string>
  <string id="6056327">Got one!</string>
  <string id="6056331">This isn't doing the trick.</string>
  <string id="6056332">Anyone got a better plan?</string>
  <string id="6056333">I don't think we're hurting them.</string>
  <string id="6056337">I can't reach that!</string>
  <string id="6056338">They're too far!</string>
  <string id="6056339">We'll need to close the distance.</string>
  <string id="6056343">More!</string>
  <string id="6056344">They've got reinforcements!</string>
  <string id="6056345">Uh-oh. They've got friends.</string>
  <string id="6056349">Looks like things are getting bloody.</string>
  <string id="6056350">Ready when you are.</string>
  <string id="6056351">I don't think they're here to chat.</string>

  <string id="6056378">Oh, no! Bethany!</string>
  <string id="6056382">Carver's dead!</string>
  <string id="6056386">They took out Fenris!</string>
  <string id="6056390">Isabela's out!</string>
  <string id="6056394">Merrill fell!</string>
  <string id="6056398">I think Varric's down!</string>
  <string id="6056402">Oh, no! Not you too!</string>
  <string id="6056406">I told you that would get you in trouble.</string>
  <string id="6056410">No! Don't you dare!</string>
  <string id="6056414">No! Don't be dead! Please!</string>
  <string id="6056418">Think you can take on a mage?</string>
  <string id="6056419">Want to see what's under these robes?</string>
  <string id="6056420">Over here, asshole!</string>
  <string id="6056424">I'm coming!</string>
  <string id="6056425">I've got your back!</string>

  <string id="6056431">It's about to charge!</string>

  <string id="6056441">Something big is brewing!</string>
  <string id="6056445">Ouch. Still hurting, here.</string>
  <string id="6056446">I need some rest.</string>
  <string id="6056447">Give me a moment to take care of this.</string>
  <string id="6056448">I still need some help.</string>
  <string id="6056449">Oooh. It's still oozing.</string>
  <string id="6056453">Well, we won.</string>
  <string id="6056454">Looks like we made it.</string>

  <string id="6056457">Where to now?</string>
  <string id="6056461">Ooh. That was a close one.</string>
  <string id="6056462">Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6056463">Even my teeth hurt.</string>
  <string id="6056464">My bruises have bruises.</string>
  <string id="6056465">I think I broke every bone in my body.</string>
  <string id="6056469">I don't think so.</string>
  <string id="6056470">What, do you think I'm magic?</string>
  <string id="6056471">I'm a mage, not a miracle-worker.</string>
  <string id="6056475">Watch out.</string>
  <string id="6056476">Trap ahead.</string>
  <string id="6056477">Don't trip that wire.</string>
  <string id="6056481">Done.</string>
  <string id="6056482">Told you I had it.</string>
  <string id="6056483">Perfect on the first try.</string>
  <string id="6056487">Need a hand?</string>
  <string id="6056488">I've got the touch.</string>
  <string id="6056489">I'll handle that.</string>

  <string id="6056570">The Fallen Warehouse is what you seek. Laughs</string>
  <string id="6056579">Laughs Ha? I don't get it.</string>
  <string id="6056582">Run back to Hightown, while you can. Else Booker will stab you, too.</string>
  <string id="6056585">In the face!</string>
  <string id="6056588">You shouldn't of said that, Marta.</string>

  <string id="6056612">I always wondered what humans meant by dreams. Can't say I care for it.</string>
  <string id="6056615">This is it? I figured the Fade would be full of sex and boats and violence! I mean, based on my dreams.</string>

  <string id="6056726">Does that happen every time you're in the Fade?</string>

  <string id="6057090">An issue for another time. We're here for the fugitives.</string>
  <string id="6057093">The elves are now viddathari. They have chosen to submit to the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6057094">Surely you know these elves are only here to escape justice.</string>
  <string id="6057095">They're criminals.</string>
  <string id="6057096">Kirkwall justice.</string>
  <string id="6057099">Have they truly converted, or are they simply using you as a shield?</string>
  <string id="6057100">Do they really believe?</string>
  <string id="6057101">They have chosen, and so have I.</string>
  <string id="6057104">You must know that harboring murderers will lead to bloodshed.</string>
  <string id="6057105">You can't shelter them.</string>
  <string id="6057106">It will lead where it must.</string>
  <string id="6057109">You have seen the corruption in this city, the suffering that is allowed. All to selfishly deny the truth of the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6057112">Let us look at your dangerous criminals.</string>
  <string id="6057118">Speak, viddathari. Who did you murder and why?</string>

  <string id="6057162">Guardsman Donnic’s patrol will take him right into a trap. Take Aveline to Lowtown at night to rescue him.</string>

  <string id="6057195">Champion FirstName/&gt; Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
As a courtesy for your past service, be aware that I have received complaints about your frequent companion, Guard-Captain Aveline. She is accused of coddling her men and weakening law enforcement in this crucial time. In the absence of a viscount, I am called to vacate her position and assume her authority, but I would rather not have that headache.&#13;
&#13;
Please, speak with her about these claims. As Champion, your word can decide this matter, and save the career of a good woman.&#13;

  <string id="6057196">Speak with Aveline in the barracks about the complaints that Knight-Captain Cullen has received about her.</string>
  <string id="6057197">You're in the wrong place, topsider.</string>
  <string id="6057198">Whoa! Whoa! Let's talk about this.</string>
  <string id="6057201">You're Booker. You work with Shadow, right?</string>
  <string id="6057207">Wh-what do you want?</string>
  <string id="6057208">Is Shadow a spy? A slaver? Tell me.</string>
  <string id="6057209">Who is Shadow?</string>
  <string id="6057210">I-I don't know. He does buy slaves—he's real partial to the ladies.</string>
  <string id="6057213">Other than that, I don't know. I've never even seen his face.</string>
  <string id="6057214">Someone told me that you stabbed a guard. That your handiwork, Booker?</string>
  <string id="6057215">Did you stab Cordelia?</string>
  <string id="6057216">No, serah. Shadow had me hold her down.</string>
  <string id="6057219">Said we had to discourage anyone investigating.</string>
  <string id="6057222">Andraste, I'm so dead.</string>
  <string id="6057223">You're dead already. Tell me what I want to know and you won't have to suffer.</string>
  <string id="6057224">Help me and you'll die quick.</string>
  <string id="6057225">Where can I find Shadow? The guardsmen want to thank him for what he did to Cordelia.</string>
  <string id="6057226">Where is he?</string>
  <string id="6057227">The crazy bastard is holed up in the Undercity. Near Jonas's Demise.</string>
  <string id="6057230">Only been there once—I never want to go back. He's got some real heavies guarding him.</string>
  <string id="6057236">Please... just let me live.</string>
  <string id="6057238">Clean up your act.</string>
  <string id="6057239">I'll stop all this, I swear. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6057242">I don't want to hear another word of you. Run.</string>
  <string id="6057243">Just go.</string>
  <string id="6057247">If we ever hope to clean up Darktown, we need to send a message. Don't touch the guard.</string>
  <string id="6057248">You have to die.</string>
  <string id="6057249">No, no, no!</string>
  <string id="6057255">Please, ser, let me go! Please!</string>
  <string id="6057256">Bless you, bless you!</string>
  <string id="6057259">Hold, my brothers.</string>
  <string id="6057262">So the humans have been finding us. A pity.</string>
  <string id="6057265">Disciples? In Kirkwall?</string>
  <string id="6057268">The Architect swore he'd go deep underground.</string>
  <string id="6057271">The Architect would have us scurry. Like deepstalkers, tail between legs.</string>
  <string id="6057274">But we are free, mageling. And not all hide from you sun-dwellers.</string>
  <string id="6057275">The accommodations are drab, the city smells, and it's infested with darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6057278">It's a wonder anyone still lives here.</string>
  <string id="6057281">You! You and the Wardens killed the father! The Architect!</string>
  <string id="6057282">A darkspawn that talks?</string>
  <string id="6057285">You have not heard of the disciples? The Architect may be dead, but we live on.</string>
  <string id="6057289">You have not been hearing of the disciples? The Architect's children live and grow.</string>
  <string id="6057290">Who or what is the Architect?</string>
  <string id="6057291">The Architect?</string>
  <string id="6057292">The one who set us free. We are no longer a slave to the song.</string>
  <string id="6057295">Why are you hiding in Kirkwall?</string>
  <string id="6057296">What are you doing here?</string>
  <string id="6057300">Few of your females survive the change to birth my brethren.</string>
  <string id="6057303">Many broodmothers I will create. Enough to claim the depths for me!</string>
  <string id="6057306">Why does no one know that darkspawn are here?</string>
  <string id="6057307">How did you stay hidden?</string>
  <string id="6057308">You humans are shallow. With shiny coins and trinkets, mouths can be sewn shut.</string>
  <string id="6057317">It is good to be among my people again.</string>
  <string id="6057318">I worried for so long that they would judge me for bearing a human son. But it's as if I never left.</string>
  <string id="6057319">I don't know why I ever stayed away.</string>
  <string id="6057320">Perhaps if I had raised Feynriel here, he would be with me still.</string>
  <string id="6057321">I hear the templars have grown more abusive of the mages in Kirkwall. I'm glad Feynriel is no longer subject to their whims.</string>
  <string id="6057325">You monster! Get away from me!</string>
  <string id="6057329">There must still be a way to bring him back. I won't give Feynriel up to the demons!</string>
  <string id="6057330">The Keeper says the only one who might be able to help my Feynriel now is the asha'bellanar.</string>
  <string id="6057331">The Witch of the Wilds is my only hope. I must find her.</string>
  <string id="6057338">Thrask tells me the Circle can't find Feynriel anywhere. He just... disappeared.</string>
  <string id="6057342">The Keeper says Feynriel left in the night, before she even returned to him.</string>
  <string id="6057343">A letter came in the post. Feynriel says he has found a tutor who knows something of this dreaming.</string>
  <string id="6057344">I have scoured Feynriel's letter for where he might be, but I can find no clue.</string>
  <string id="6057345">I think it is time I returned to my people. I have nothing left to hold me here.</string>
  <string id="6057346">Master Ilen pointed out the ironbark's location but warned that darkspawn are in the area.</string>
  <string id="6057347">What happened that warriors as skilled as the Dalish refuse to venture to the area?</string>
  <string id="6057348">Why forbid your hunters?</string>
  <string id="6057349">Your respect for our hunters is most surprising, stranger. </string>
  <string id="6057352">What's the problem? Maybe I can give you a hand dealing with it.</string>
  <string id="6057353">Can I help?</string>
  <string id="6057354">I find it insulting that you think you would succeed where we could not.</string>
  <string id="6057357">Just tell me where to find it.</string>
  <string id="6057358">I don't care about that.</string>
  <string id="6057362">The place is overrun by darkspawn. If we tried to eradicate them, we would risk the precious few hunters we have left.</string>
  <string id="6057365">I'll show you where the area is. What you do with the information is up to you.</string>
  <string id="6057371">Dalish crafting is second to none, I assure you.</string>
  <string id="6057379">Kirkwall needs more people like you.</string>
  <string id="6057386">Shadow was a talking darkspawn: a disciple.</string>
  <string id="6057392">You hear tale of them from Amaranthine. Stuff out of nightmares.</string>
  <string id="6057395">Andraste's knickers, if word got out... it'd start a panic.</string>
  <string id="6057396">We can't keep something like this quiet.</string>
  <string id="6057397">We have to tell people.</string>
  <string id="6057398">Either people would believe you and, well... panic, or we'll be a laughing stock.</string>
  <string id="6057413">I'll let the captain know, but I don't expect he'll do much. Now, your handiwork more than merits a reward.</string>
  <string id="6057417">Then this matter is over.</string>
  <string id="6057418">My work here is done.</string>
  <string id="6057419">I can't thank you enough. The reward, as promised.</string>
  <string id="6057422">I put in a little extra because of the unique... challenges you came across.</string>
  <string id="6057425">Farewell.</string>
  <string id="6057428">The magistrate was surprised that his bounty was refused.</string>
  <string id="6057566">By all means! Feel free to browse the table whenever you like!</string>
  <string id="6057572">Come, partake of my wares!</string>
  <string id="6057574">Confront Captain Jeven at the barracks in the Keep about guards being used to pass secrets.</string>
  <string id="6057575">Donnic Encounter</string>
  <string id="6057576">Donnic Encounter</string>
  <string id="6057580">Coterie Thug</string>
  <string id="6057584">Coterie Thug</string>
  <string id="6057590">There will be no mercy!</string>
  <string id="6057591">You won't be forgiven for this!</string>
  <string id="6057592">This will be quick!</string>
  <string id="6057593">To the Void with you!</string>
  <string id="6057594">Aim for the heart!</string>
  <string id="6057598">I'm getting overwhelmed!</string>
  <string id="6057599">Defend me!</string>
  <string id="6057603">To me, my brethren!</string>
  <string id="6057604">To my side!</string>
  <string id="6057608">This is getting me nowhere!</string>
  <string id="6057609">Maybe I should try something else!</string>
  <string id="6057613">So much better!</string>
  <string id="6057614">Praise Andraste!</string>
  <string id="6057623">I can't... break... free!</string>
  <string id="6057624">Andraste! I'm caught!</string>
  <string id="6057628">This is taking too long!</string>
  <string id="6057629">My arm is failing.</string>
  <string id="6057633">I'm not sure I'll make it.</string>
  <string id="6057634">In the name of the Maker... help me!</string>
  <string id="6057635">Not here... I can't die here!</string>
  <string id="6057639">No one can stand against the templars!</string>
  <string id="6057640">This one is taken care of!</string>
  <string id="6057644">Why isn't this working?</string>
  <string id="6057645">This is useless!</string>
  <string id="6057649">There!</string>
  <string id="6057650">Nasty little sneak!</string>
  <string id="6057654">Kill the fiend!</string>
  <string id="6057655">Stop the freak first!</string>
  <string id="6057659">Go for the archer!</string>
  <string id="6057660">The archer! Kill the archer!</string>
  <string id="6057664">They're too powerful! Retreat!</string>
  <string id="6057665">I will not die today!</string>
  <string id="6057718">Collapsed Tunnel</string>
  <string id="6057739">The captain likes his thieves so much, let's see if they welcome him in prison.</string>
  <string id="6057747">Do not defy me!</string>
  <string id="6057748">You will fall!</string>
  <string id="6057749">No human enters the Fade and lives!</string>
  <string id="6057755">To me!</string>
  <string id="6057760">To my side!</string>
  <string id="6057765">Perhaps this will do the trick.</string>
  <string id="6057780">I can't move.</string>
  <string id="6057785">This is draining.</string>
  <string id="6057786">I would prefer to be done.</string>
  <string id="6057790">My resources are slowing.</string>
  <string id="6057795">I can't believe this!</string>
  <string id="6057797">Do not let this mortal finish me!</string>
  <string id="6057801">Hah!</string>
  <string id="6057802">Take that, mortal!</string>
  <string id="6057806">This isn't working.</string>
  <string id="6057811">There you are...</string>
  <string id="6057816">Take out the vessel!</string>
  <string id="6057817">The vessel must go down!</string>
  <string id="6057821">Over there! Stop them!</string>
  <string id="6057826">This isn't worth it.</string>
  <string id="6058002">Do not defy me!</string>
  <string id="6058003">Fall before my might!</string>
  <string id="6058004">No human resists me and lives!</string>
  <string id="6058008">To me, minions!</string>
  <string id="6058012">Defend me!</string>
  <string id="6058016">This will be even better.</string>
  <string id="6058025">I can't move!</string>
  <string id="6058030">We must end this quickly.</string>
  <string id="6058034">I can't believe you've lasted this long.</string>
  <string id="6058039">Do not let this mortal finish me!</string>
  <string id="6058043">You are finished!</string>
  <string id="6058044">Surrender, mortal!</string>
  <string id="6058048">This isn't working.</string>
  <string id="6058052">I've found you!</string>
  <string id="6058057">The vessel must go down!</string>
  <string id="6058061">Over there! Stop them!</string>
  <string id="6058065">You're hardly worth this effort.</string>
  <string id="6058121">Kill the puppets of the Chantry!</string>
  <string id="6058122">Get the Champion!</string>
  <string id="6058123">Die! All of you!</string>
  <string id="6058124">For Decimus!</string>
  <string id="6058128">I'm getting overpowered!</string>
  <string id="6058129">I need a hand over here!</string>
  <string id="6058133">To me!</string>
  <string id="6058134">We need to regroup!</string>
  <string id="6058138">Perhaps this instead!</string>
  <string id="6058142">Potion!</string>
  <string id="6058143">That hits the spot!</string>
  <string id="6058152">Bloody bastards... can't move!</string>
  <string id="6058153">Why can't I get free?</string>
  <string id="6058157">Wearing... out.</string>
  <string id="6058158">I've failed you, Decimus.</string>
  <string id="6058162">There's nothing left!</string>
  <string id="6058163">I can't finish it.</string>
  <string id="6058167">No... I can't die like this.</string>
  <string id="6058168">I need a healer!</string>
  <string id="6058169">Someone... help!</string>
  <string id="6058173">And stay down!</string>
  <string id="6058174">And that was the best you could do?</string>
  <string id="6058178">Why won't this work?</string>
  <string id="6058182">Hey!</string>
  <string id="6058183">Who is that?</string>
  <string id="6058187">Take down the traitor!</string>
  <string id="6058188">Get the caster!</string>
  <string id="6058192">Kill the archer!</string>
  <string id="6058193">Take out their cover fire!</string>
  <string id="6058197">Nothing is worth my death!</string>
  <string id="6058198">I won't die by your hand!</string>
  <string id="6058282">Need to put someone to sleep? I'm your man.</string>
  <string id="6058284">Don't ingest the merchandise. It's not recommended.</string>
  <string id="6058288">I'll bleed them!</string>
  <string id="6058289">Let's cut the blighters open!</string>
  <string id="6058290">Don't leave any witnesses!</string>
  <string id="6058291">You asked for this!</string>
  <string id="6058292">I've got this!</string>
  <string id="6058296">Help me take this bastard down!</string>
  <string id="6058297">Let's kill this blighter!</string>
  <string id="6058301">Get over here!</string>
  <string id="6058307">Change of plans!</string>
  <string id="6058322">I can't bloody move!</string>
  <string id="6058326">I can't keep this pace up!</string>
  <string id="6058327">I'm almost worn out!</string>
  <string id="6058332">Blast! This isn't happening!</string>
  <string id="6058337">Another one falls!</string>
  <string id="6058338">That's enough out of you!</string>
  <string id="6058342">This doesn't bloody work!</string>
  <string id="6058347">Somebody wants to die!</string>
  <string id="6058352">Kill the robe!</string>
  <string id="6058357">Bring down the archer!</string>
  <string id="6058362">Maker's breath!</string>
  <string id="6058421">Come! We attack!</string>
  <string id="6058422">The righteous shall prevail!</string>
  <string id="6058423">Forward!</string>
  <string id="6058424">Let us strike and be swift!</string>
  <string id="6058425">To victory!</string>
  <string id="6058426">Let justice be done!</string>
  <string id="6058427">They cannot win!</string>
  <string id="6058428">Press the attack!</string>
  <string id="6058439">I need assistance.</string>
  <string id="6058440">To me! To me!</string>
  <string id="6058446">Be my shield!</string>
  <string id="6058447">To my side!</string>
  <string id="6058451">Perhaps another way.</string>
  <string id="6058455">I am revitalized.</string>
  <string id="6058468">I am trapped!</string>
  <string id="6058473">I am flagging.</string>
  <string id="6058475">My will grows weak.</string>
  <string id="6058479">I'm losing my focus.</string>
  <string id="6058480">I can do no more.</string>
  <string id="6058485">It is too much!</string>
  <string id="6058486">No, I will not allow it!</string>
  <string id="6058487">I must prevail.</string>
  <string id="6058491">Another defeated!</string>
  <string id="6058492">One more vanquished!</string>
  <string id="6058493">To the shadows with you!</string>
  <string id="6058494">One falls before me!</string>
  <string id="6058499">What is this? My strikes do nothing!</string>
  <string id="6058505">I will close the distance.</string>
  <string id="6058506">We must get closer.</string>
  <string id="6058511">More arrive.</string>
  <string id="6058512">Reinforcements!</string>
  <string id="6058517">My sword is yours.</string>
  <string id="6058518">All sinners will die.</string>
  <string id="6058519">For justice!</string>
  <string id="6058525">I am back.</string>
  <string id="6058529">You have my thanks.</string>
  <string id="6058533">Your friend is down.</string>
  <string id="6058534">Quickly! Before they get anyone else.</string>
  <string id="6058566">I will avenge you.</string>
  <string id="6058582">I despise all you stand for!</string>
  <string id="6058583">Who wants to take me on!</string>
  <string id="6058588">I'm coming!</string>
  <string id="6058709">You there, stranger. Looking for any fine Dalish weaponry? Armor?</string>
  <string id="6058725">Viscount's Keep</string>
  <string id="6058734">I'll bleed them!</string>
  <string id="6058735">Let's cut the blighters open!</string>
  <string id="6058737">You asked for this!</string>
  <string id="6058738">I've got this!</string>
  <string id="6058742">Help me take this bastard down!</string>
  <string id="6058747">Get over here!</string>
  <string id="6058751">Change of plans!</string>
  <string id="6058759">I can't bloody move!</string>
  <string id="6058763">I can't keep this pace up!</string>
  <string id="6058768">Blast! This isn't happening!</string>
  <string id="6058772">Another one falls!</string>

  <string id="6058789">Bring down the archer!</string>
  <string id="6058793">Maker's breath!</string>
  <string id="6058830">On them!</string>
  <string id="6058833">City Guardsman</string>
  <string id="6058841">Did Carver join the gray wardens?</string>
  <string id="6058842">Yes</string>
  <string id="6058843">Yes</string>
  <string id="6058844">No - he joined the templars</string>
  <string id="6058845">No - he joined the templars</string>
  <string id="6058846">Did Bethany join the gray wardens?</string>
  <string id="6058852">Yes</string>
  <string id="6058853">Yes</string>
  <string id="6058854">No - she joined the circle</string>
  <string id="6058855">No - she joined the circle</string>
  <string id="6058863">You let him live, even after what he did? I guess I shouldn't be surprised—you shems stick together.</string>
  <string id="6058864">I need to take him back to the magistrate. At least Lia is safe now. </string>
  <string id="6058865">I'm sorry, Elren.</string>
  <string id="6058866">Your daughter's still alive, right?</string>
  <string id="6058867">Be grateful.</string>
  <string id="6058868">What if he comes after Lia again?</string>
  <string id="6058871">I need to get my family out of Kirkwall. That's the only way we'll be safe from that monster. </string>
  <string id="6058877">We'll take the prisoner from here. The magistrate will be happy to see him in one piece.</string>
  <string id="6058886">He's right here. Finish him off, if you like. I doubt he'll put up much of a fight.</string>
  <string id="6058887">You kill him, then.</string>
  <string id="6058888">No, papa!</string>
  <string id="6058894">De Launcet Mansion</string>
  <string id="6058900">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6058924">I trust you are well, Donnic?</string>
  <string id="6058927">I am, and your reward is well earned. It will be grand having you over me.</string>
  <string id="6058930">Above me. In rank, guard captain.</string>
  <string id="6058937">We found a number of debts to... suspect peoples. Such poor character.</string>
  <string id="6058943">But you, Aveline Vallen, have proven your loyalty and ability.</string>
  <string id="6058946">The guard deserves better than him, messere.</string>
  <string id="6058949">Indeed. The viscount would have you put your care for the men into direct practice. You will assume the captain's job.</string>
  <string id="6058952">What?</string>
  <string id="6058955">In due time, of course. There will be training, approvals. Months, at least.</string>
  <string id="6058960">Captain Jeven is in disgrace. Aveline will be promoted to captain of the guard.</string>
  <string id="6058962">Apologies. I'm quite busy.</string>

  <string id="6059002">Like so many others.</string>
  <string id="6059003">Just like everyone.</string>
  <string id="6059004">As am I.</string>
  <string id="6059007">Me too, serah.</string>
  <string id="6059010">I as well.</string>
  <string id="6059013">I have traveled with magic users. I don't fear them.</string>
  <string id="6059014">I know many mages.</string>
  <string id="6059015">You waste your breath. He'll never tolerate my kind.</string>
  <string id="6059029">Thank you, Hawke. There's no need for such fear.</string>
  <string id="6059036">I'd hope not, Sister.</string>
  <string id="6059039">I'd hope not, Brother.</string>
  <string id="6059042">You and Saarebas—Bas Saarebas—are of the same womb?</string>
  <string id="6059059">It is a shame. We're nice people!</string>
  <string id="6059062">I couldn't agree more.</string>
  <string id="6059071">I do not fear them either. That is because I am Arvaarad, the lead. Perhaps you are a lead as well.</string>
  <string id="6059074">Or you are corrupted and do not know it. That is the danger they present.</string>
  <string id="6059075">It's a shame they cannot see our worth.</string>
  <string id="6059141">Hear you're having problems with the Bone Pit. I can help.</string>
  <string id="6059144">We'll be hearing from that one again.</string>
  <string id="6059145">That one will be back. Unfortunately.</string>
  <string id="6059146">We'll be hearing from that one again.</string>
  <string id="6059147">We've not heard the last of that one.</string>
  <string id="6059148">We'll be hearing from that one again.</string>
  <string id="6059149">We'll be hearing from that one again.</string>
  <string id="6059150">We'll be hearing from that one again.</string>
  <string id="6059151">She'll be trouble.</string>
  <string id="6059152">I'll have to keep and eye out for that one.</string>
  <string id="6059190">I know that kind of blind instinct. It is hard to judge how much control he has.</string>
  <string id="6059191">Get Aveline in my active party.</string>
  <string id="6059192">Aveline in party</string>
  <string id="6059220">Family Matter</string>
  <string id="6059223">He may not know, himself.</string>
  <string id="6059226">The sister has assumed a great deal from a few grunts and twitches.</string>
  <string id="6059227">I bet all he wants is to go chasing after thrown sticks. And someone to rub his belly.</string>
  <string id="6059228">For all we know, he's asking for a chamber pot.</string>
  <string id="6059229">The sister has assumed a great deal from a few grunts and twitches.</string>
  <string id="6059230">I don't know how the sister can think she understands his wishes.</string>
  <string id="6059231">The sister has assumed a great deal from a few grunts and twitches.</string>
  <string id="6059232">Why does that woman think he wants to leave? He's just... sort of a great lump.</string>
  <string id="6059233">The sister has assumed a great deal from a few grunts and twitches.</string>
  <string id="6059235">Huon...</string>
  <string id="6059238">Hush, love. Don't be afraid.</string>
  <string id="6059241">Your blood will bring new life to our people.</string>
  <string id="6059244">Whimpers</string>
  <string id="6059247">Anything else?</string>
  <string id="6059248">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6059249">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6059251">Are you a specialist? What sort of things do you make?</string>
  <string id="6059252">Tell me about your trade.</string>
  <string id="6059253">A Dalish crafter does many things. We create weapons, armor, anything our clan has need of. </string>
  <string id="6059259">I don' t need anything right now.</string>
  <string id="6059260">No, I'm fine.</string>
  <string id="6059261">Of course.</string>
  <string id="6059264">Look at you. Like fat dathrasi you feed and feed and complain only when your meal is interrupted.</string>
  <string id="6059267">You do not look up. You do not see that the grass is bare. All you leave in your wake is misery.</string>
  <string id="6059270">You are blind. I will make you see.</string>
  <string id="6059276">But we have guests.</string>
  <string id="6059279">Help Varric investigate Bartrand's Hightown mansion.</string>
  <string id="6059280">Search the mansion for Bartrand.</string>
  <string id="6059281">Varric must face down his backstabbing brother in an epic battle to the death.</string>
  <string id="6059282">Search the mansion for Bartrand.</string>
  <string id="6059283">Find Bartrand and put a stop to his depravity.</string>
  <string id="6059284">Bartrand has been found alive and stark raving mad.</string>
  <string id="6059285">Varric got revenge on his brother for his betrayal in the Deep Roads.</string>
  <string id="6059291">That doesn't excuse murder!</string>
  <string id="6059292">Are these elves telling the truth?</string>
  <string id="6059293">Is it true, Aveline?</string>
  <string id="6059294">There have been rumors. I will investigate, but they still took the law into their own hands.</string>
  <string id="6059300">Your law has failed viddathari before. If I cannot be satisfied, why should the lowest of you expect different?</string>
  <string id="6059303">I don't know. But that doesn't make what they did right.</string>
  <string id="6059304">I would have done the same thing, in their shoes.</string>
  <string id="6059305">Yes it does.</string>
  <string id="6059306">Hawke, that's not helping.</string>
  <string id="6059309">What these men did was wrong.</string>
  <string id="6059310">Aveline is right.</string>
  <string id="6059311">Their actions are mere symptoms. Your society is the disease.</string>
  <string id="6059314">They have chosen. The viddathari will submit to the Qun and find a path your way has denied them.</string>
  <string id="6059317">You can't just decide that. You must hand them over.</string>
  <string id="6059320">Tell me, Hawke: what would you do, in my place?</string>
  <string id="6059321">Give us the elves or we'll take them by force.</string>
  <string id="6059322">Just hand them over!</string>
  <string id="6059323">Hawke...</string>
  <string id="6059326">Impressive. But I am committed.</string>
  <string id="6059329">This isn't Qunari land, and they aren't your people.</string>
  <string id="6059330">Let us arrest them.</string>
  <string id="6059331">I see.</string>
  <string id="6059334">As a guest in this city, I would keep the peace.</string>
  <string id="6059335">Let us arrest them.</string>
  <string id="6059336">They would make poor Qunari without the horns.</string>
  <string id="6059337">Let us arrest them.</string>
  <string id="6059338">I'd fight anyone who tried to take them from me.</string>
  <string id="6059339">I wouldn't give them up.</string>
  <string id="6059340">Exactly so.</string>
  <string id="6059343">They deserve another chance.</string>
  <string id="6059344">I wouldn't give them up.</string>
  <string id="6059345">Why pass up perfectly good converts?</string>
  <string id="6059346">I wouldn't give them up.</string>
  <string id="6059347">You clearly don't like staying amongst humans.</string>
  <string id="6059348">Why not leave the city?</string>
  <string id="6059349">I cannot leave without the relic, and I cannot stay and remain blind to this dysfunction.</string>
  <string id="6059352">There is only one solution.</string>
  <string id="6059381">I sent others before, but no word. Perhaps they are putting me off! I need someone competent to figure out what is going on.</string>
  <string id="6059385">I'll head there soon.</string>
  <string id="6059386">That's all I need to know.</string>
  <string id="6059387">Your first mistake was naming your mine the Bone Pit.</string>
  <string id="6059388">Is Bone Pit a tad ominous?</string>
  <string id="6059392">The locals named the mine. Those fools say it is cursed.</string>
  <string id="6059395">That is why I hire Fereldans. They may be dull-witted, but they are not superstitious.</string>
  <string id="6059396">Mind what you say about my countrymen.</string>
  <string id="6059397">You know I'm one of them?</string>
  <string id="6059398">I was not referring to you, of course. My workers are a particularly desperate sort.</string>
  <string id="6059401">They are lucky to work for me. Few in Kirkwall will hire refugees.</string>
  <string id="6059402">I am at a loss! No miner has reported in, and no one takes me seriously.</string>
  <string id="6059405">I will pay handsomely. The exact amount depends on what perils you face.</string>
  <string id="6059408">I solved your problem.</string>
  <string id="6059411">So, what happened? One of the miners told me you rescued him from dragons. I cuffed him for lying.</string>
  <string id="6059420">But... I thought they're extinct! Eh, I believe you. You made them extinct again? If it is safe, the miners can return to work.</string>
  <string id="6059423">I appreciate your concern for my worker's welfare. I could use someone like you to ensure their continued safety.</string>
  <string id="6059426">I bet their first task will be cleaning up the entrails the last shift left behind.</string>
  <string id="6059427">I don't envy them.</string>
  <string id="6059428">A dragon killer and a mind reader. Wonderful!</string>
  <string id="6059435">So to our first order of business: we replace the lost workers. </string>

  <string id="6059569">What are you doing? Don't talk to him with me here!</string>
  <string id="6059572">Where in the plot would you like to go?</string>
  <string id="6059573">Let's get this bad boy over with.</string>
  <string id="6059574">Finish plot.</string>

  <string id="6059606">You won't get out of here alive.</string>

  <string id="6059610">Slave</string>
  <string id="6059614">Refugee</string>
  <string id="6059616">Talk to Aveline about why she would give Donnic a cheap copper relief of marigolds.</string>
  <string id="6059622">That was awkward. What was Aveline thinking?</string>
  <string id="6059625">Hawke Estate</string>
  <string id="6059649">Meeran</string>
  <string id="6059651">Athenril</string>

  <string id="6059659">Parshaara.</string>
  <string id="6059662">You are basalit-an after all. Few in this city command such respect.</string>
  <string id="6059665">So tell me, Hawke: You know I am denied Par Vollen until the Tome of Koslun is found.</string>
  <string id="6059668">How would you see this conflict resolved without it?</string>
  <string id="6059669">Shanedan, Hawke. I expected you.</string>
  <string id="6059672">This madness must end.</string>
  <string id="6059673">You've gone too far.</string>
  <string id="6059674">We can still work this out.</string>
  <string id="6059675">Let them go.</string>
  <string id="6059676">Perhaps.</string>
  <string id="6059679">I see a man who's ready to start a war on principle.</string>
  <string id="6059680">I can see just fine.</string>
  <string id="6059681">And what would the Qunari be without principle? You, I suspect.</string>
  <string id="6059687">Prove yourself, basra, or kneel with your brethren.</string>
  <string id="6059688">Thank the Maker! And thank you!</string>
  <string id="6059691">Then here comes Crankovich, limping towards us and moaning. I said, Oy, Crankovich! Thought them spiders got you.</string>
  <string id="6059697">Is there anything else I need to know?</string>
  <string id="6059698">That's all?</string>
  <string id="6059699">Do you know what manner of beasts they are?</string>
  <string id="6059700">What kind of creatures?</string>
  <string id="6059701">I don't know what they look like. I've never seen one myself.</string>
  <string id="6059704">The guards say these things have already torn through a full company of men.</string>
  <string id="6059723">Post the duty roster for the week and observe Donnic’s reaction.</string>
  <string id="6059726">Duty Roster</string>

  <string id="6059759">Go!</string>
  <string id="6059767">Guardsman Brennan</string>
  <string id="6059772">What? You're daft. I'm working dockside on those smugglers.</string>
  <string id="6059775">Says here you're guarding the square. Always been a make-work job, that one. You someone's pet?</string>
  <string id="6059778">Check your eyes. It's a mistake.</string>
  <string id="6059781">Says the pet.</string>
  <string id="6059782">I hear you're in need of a bit of help.</string>
  <string id="6059783">I'm here to do your job for you. Where's the fugitive?</string>

  <string id="6059911">Good to see you back!</string>
  <string id="6059914">Our shelves are still a bit bare. I could use some help with that, if you're interested.</string>
  <string id="6059915">There's nothing that could interest me more, my good man!</string>
  <string id="6059916">Of course I'll help.</string>
  <string id="6059917">Copper Marigolds</string>
  <string id="6059919">For now, partner, please be sure to visit our workers occasionally. You have a knack for keeping them happy.</string>
  <string id="6059930">Find either Athenril or Meeran in the Gallows Courtyard. Either might be willing to provide a way into Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6059932">Lord Friedrich is somewhere in the Gallows Courtyard area. Find and kill him.</string>
  <string id="6059934">Return to Meeran. He will want to know Friedrich is dead.</string>
  <string id="6059935">Meeran has agreed to provide a way into Kirkwall. Go speak to Gamlen.</string>

  <string id="6059963">She will pay for what she's done.</string>
  <string id="6059964">Isabela betrayed me.</string>
  <string id="6059965">It is too late for that.</string>
  <string id="6059968">The plan was to get the tome and give it to you.</string>
  <string id="6059969">I didn't mean to.</string>
  <string id="6059970">Admirable. But I still do not have it.</string>
  <string id="6059973">It does sound bad when you say it like that.</string>
  <string id="6059974">When you put it that way...</string>
  <string id="6059975">You will answer for the crimes of those who serve you. Their offence is yours.</string>
  <string id="6059978">You have granted this man basalit-an. By this admission, he now has the right to challenge you.</string>
  <string id="6059981">You know our ways.</string>
  <string id="6059984">I know that respect is hard won, but it also earns privilege.</string>
  <string id="6059985">You have granted this woman basalit-an. By this admission, she now has the right to challenge you.</string>
  <string id="6059988">If you truly knew the Qun, elf, you would not suggest I battle a female.</string>
  <string id="6059991">But she is no female. She is a respected outsider, by your own words.</string>
  <string id="6059994">What say you, Hawke? Do you agree to a duel?</string>
  <string id="6059995">Anything special I should know?</string>
  <string id="6059996">What are the rules?</string>
  <string id="6059997">We fight to the death, you and I alone.</string>
  <string id="6060000">Kill me and the duty that binds me is ended. The others will return to Par Vollen.</string>
  <string id="6060003">And if you kill me?</string>
  <string id="6060006">Then you are dead.</string>
  <string id="6060012">You are worth killing personally, Hawke. Duel me, and show these vashedan bas how to die.</string>
  <string id="6060015">Ataash varin kata. In the end lies glory.</string>
  <string id="6060093">It took me a while to get back, what with all the fighting everywhere. You know how it is.</string>
  <string id="6060096">You betrayed me!</string>
  <string id="6060097">You caused this!</string>
  <string id="6060098">Could we? Maybe you're right. Normally I wouldn't have cared.</string>
  <string id="6060101">I thought you'd be long gone by now.</string>
  <string id="6060102">I'm glad you returned.</string>
  <string id="6060103">Heroic acts of sacrifice? What will people say?</string>
  <string id="6060104">This is unlike you.</string>
  <string id="6060105">This is your damned influence, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6060108">I was halfway to Ostwick before I knew I had to turn around. It's pathetic.</string>
  <string id="6060111">The relic is reclaimed. I am now free to return to Par Vollen—with the thief.</string>
  <string id="6060114">What?</string>
  <string id="6060117">She stole the Tome of Koslun. She must return with us.</string>
  <string id="6060118">Sounds like you have something very specific in mind.</string>
  <string id="6060119">What exactly will you do?</string>
  <string id="6060120">She will submit to the Qun and the Ben-Hassrath. More than that I will not say.</string>
  <string id="6060121">Take her and go.</string>
  <string id="6060122">I agree.</string>
  <string id="6060123">Most wise.</string>
  <string id="6060126">No! Hawke, you bastard! I came back to help you!</string>
  <string id="6060129">No! Hawke, you bitch! I came back to help you!</string>
  <string id="6060132">After you betrayed me.</string>
  <string id="6060135">This means peace with the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6060138">You are helping.</string>
  <string id="6060141">Fight me, you coward. You want to send me off with them, fight me first.</string>
  <string id="6060142">You have your relic. She stays with us.</string>
  <string id="6060143">You can't have her.</string>
  <string id="6060144">Isabela will answer according to our laws, not yours.</string>
  <string id="6060145">We'll punish her.</string>
  <string id="6060149">It is done.</string>
  <string id="6060150">You knew the risks, Isabela. You always did.</string>
  <string id="6060151">You have to see it through.</string>
  <string id="6060152">This is what I get for believing you were different, that you... cared about me.</string>
  <string id="6060155">I should have known better than to come back. Won't make that mistake again.</string>
  <string id="6060161">I have no choice, Isabela.</string>
  <string id="6060164">There's always a choice! I made a choice!</string>
  <string id="6060175">I'm not going to fight you.</string>
  <string id="6060176">He's right, Isabela.</string>
  <string id="6060177">It figures. I always knew you didn't have it in you.</string>
  <string id="6060183">Then you leave me no choice.</string>
  <string id="6060186">I challenge you, Hawke. You and I will battle to the death, with her as the prize.</string>
  <string id="6060189">No! If you're going to duel anyone, duel me!</string>
  <string id="6060192">You are not basalit-an. You are unworthy.</string>
  <string id="6060193">Don't you have what you came for?</string>
  <string id="6060194">Why not take the relic and go?</string>
  <string id="6060195">You know we do not suffer thieves. She cannot walk away from this insult.</string>
  <string id="6060198">I will take her. If you object, duty demands that we fight.</string>
  <string id="6060199">If there's no other way, then do it.</string>
  <string id="6060200">Then take her.</string>
  <string id="6060201">I accept your challenge.</string>
  <string id="6060202">I will fight you.</string>
  <string id="6060203">I refuse your challenge.</string>
  <string id="6060204">I won't duel.</string>
  <string id="6060226">You're right. We are hardly the only ones to bear that grief.</string>
  <string id="6060227">A fair point.</string>
  <string id="6060228">Precisely.</string>
  <string id="6060231">Why don't you just stab me in the back while you're at it?</string>
  <string id="6060232">Ouch. Low blow!</string>
  <string id="6060233">Leave my mother out of this!</string>
  <string id="6060234">How dare you.</string>
  <string id="6060235">Cold corpses speak louder than abstract freedoms, do they not?</string>
  <string id="6060238">As long as that's true, Kirkwall needs its templars more than it needs a new ruler.</string>
  <string id="6060261">Those magickers need to be taught a lesson.</string>
  <string id="6060262">The knight-commander's getting out of control.</string>
  <string id="6060266">The knight-commander's right. We don't have time for politics until the mages are under control.</string>
  <string id="6060267">The viscount had no heir. Will you take his place, Champion?</string>
  <string id="6060271">Those robes are always trying to change our minds. They shouldn't be allowed to speak in public.</string>
  <string id="6060272">I've got a daughter in the Circle. There's a lot of mages in the city who aren't blood mages.</string>
  <string id="6060276">We're not safe while mages walk the streets.</string>
  <string id="6060277">Would you be our viscount, Champion? I know I'd feel safe with you in the Keep.</string>
  <string id="6060281">That elf should hang for daring to speak against the knight-commander.</string>
  <string id="6060282">The knight-commander's mad. I wish you really were the viscount...</string>
  <string id="6060283">Wonderful! I was hoping you'd say yes!</string>
  <string id="6060297">Are you in need of any potions today, my friend?</string>
  <string id="6060303">Are you in need of any potions today, my friend?</string>
  <string id="6060306">Why would they be gathering hostages?</string>
  <string id="6060307">Why the Keep?</string>
  <string id="6060308">They're going to take everyone of import and put them in the same place.</string>
  <string id="6060311">Those that agree to convert, live. Those that don't...</string>
  <string id="6060314">Charming.</string>
  <string id="6060315">To get everyone important in one place, where they can be controlled... or killed.</string>
  <string id="6060318">This is not random slaughter—they are no doubt trying to convert the city to their heathen religion. By force.</string>
  <string id="6060321">Whatever they are doing, we must stop them.</string>
  <string id="6060325">Ah, my young friend, you've returned!</string>
  <string id="6060328">I must sound like a Chanter, since I know you've heard me say this before but, are you perhaps interested in a small job?</string>
  <string id="6060337"> I am still in need of a few rare ingredients that, I have to admit, are difficult to obtain.</string>
  <string id="6060340">Let me know what you need, and I'll see what I can do.</string>
  <string id="6060341">I'll do it.</string>
  <string id="6060342">I'm not interested.</string>
  <string id="6060343">No thanks.</string>
  <string id="6060351">Wonderful! I'll write up a list for you!</string>
  <string id="6060354">I'm sorry to hear that.</string>
  <string id="6060359">It was either her life or mine. I chose mine.</string>
  <string id="6060360">It didn't give me much choice.</string>
  <string id="6060361">Is there anything you can make from it?</string>
  <string id="6060362">Can you use it?</string>
  <string id="6060363">And that I am glad to hear!</string>
  <string id="6060366">Have no fear, this won't take much time at all.</string>
  <string id="6060372">Are you in need of any potions today, my friend?</string>
  <string id="6060375">Somehow, I knew it would be you.</string>
  <string id="6060378">Bethany!</string>
  <string id="6060381">Hello, Brother. How fitting we should meet here.</string>
  <string id="6060382">Hello, Sister. How fitting we should meet here.</string>
  <string id="6060383">Somehow, I knew it would be you.</string>
  <string id="6060386">Carver!</string>
  <string id="6060389">Hello, big brother. Fancy meeting you here.</string>
  <string id="6060390">Hello, Sister. Fancy meeting you here.</string>
  <string id="6060393">A thank you might be in order, don't you think?</string>
  <string id="6060394">You're welcome.</string>
  <string id="6060395">I knew you didn't go to so much trouble to save me, just to throw it away now.</string>
  <string id="6060398">Pardon my manners. You save me so often I sometimes forget.</string>
  <string id="6060401">Are you injured? Are there more of you?</string>
  <string id="6060402">Are you all right?</string>
  <string id="6060403">We're fine. Everyone's here.</string>
  <string id="6060406">I'm fine. We're fine. And no, this is all of us.</string>
  <string id="6060409">Last time I checked, you'd moved on from Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6060410">I live here.</string>
  <string id="6060411">We're here on Grey Warden business.</string>
  <string id="6060414">We're here on Grey Warden business.</string>
  <string id="6060417">You have our sincere thanks. This attack was... most unexpected.</string>
  <string id="6060420">Stroud, we need to move. We've already delayed too long.</string>
  <string id="6060423">Stroud, we need to move. We've already delayed too long.</string>
  <string id="6060426">Very true.</string>
  <string id="6060429">We have not met. I am Stroud of the Grey Wardens.</string>
  <string id="6060432">I fear pressing matters take us elsewhere, but we can spread word to the other free cities. Perhaps they will bring aid.</string>
  <string id="6060433">There's something more important than an invasion?</string>
  <string id="6060434">Pressing matters?</string>
  <string id="6060435">We can't talk about it.</string>
  <string id="6060438">We can't talk about it.</string>
  <string id="6060441">The Qunari are of far greater concern to you, I am certain, but we must return to our mission.</string>
  <string id="6060443">There is, but I cannot say more.</string>
  <string id="6060445">We could use your help defending the city.</string>
  <string id="6060446">Fight with us.</string>
  <string id="6060447">Even if we wished to, Grey Wardens cannot involve themselves in political struggles. I am sorry.</string>
  <string id="6060450">Reinforcements would come in handy if we fail.</string>
  <string id="6060451">Spread the word.</string>
  <string id="6060452">But you just got here.</string>
  <string id="6060453">You're leaving, Bethany?</string>
  <string id="6060454">I've been here for six days.</string>
  <string id="6060457">But you just got here.</string>
  <string id="6060458">You're leaving, Carver?</string>
  <string id="6060459">I've been here for six days.</string>
  <string id="6060462">Wait—I need to tell you about Mother.</string>
  <string id="6060463">Bethany, Mother's gone.</string>
  <string id="6060464">I know what happened. I waited and waited for you to tell me yourself. Did you hold a funeral, or was there not enough left?</string>
  <string id="6060467">Wait—I need to tell you about Mother.</string>
  <string id="6060468">Carver, Mother's gone.</string>
  <string id="6060469">I already know what happened. I'm sure you did your best.</string>
  <string id="6060472">Take this. It is all we can spare, but perhaps it will be of use.</string>
  <string id="6060478">Goodbye, Brother. Take care of yourself.</string>
  <string id="6060481">Goodbye, Sister. Take care of yourself.</string>
  <string id="6060487">Goodbye, big brother. Take care of yourself.</string>
  <string id="6060490">Goodbye, Sister. Take care of yourself.</string>
  <string id="6060493">Maker watch over you, my friend.</string>
  <string id="6060494">Do you sell the ink you Dalish use for tattooing?</string>
  <string id="6060495">I'm looking for ink.</string>
  <string id="6060496">How dare you! That ink is sacred! We would no sooner sell it to shem than we would sell our own children!</string>
  <string id="6060500">Just like any other shem. Disrespectful, impatient and foolish.</string>
  <string id="6060505">No skin off my nose if you want to go in there and get yourself killed.</string>
  <string id="6060508">He won't leave the ruins alive.</string>
  <string id="6060509">All right, I'll help you.</string>
  <string id="6060510">I'm sure I can't be blamed if I find him beaten into a bloody pulp by unknown assailants.</string>
  <string id="6060511">All right, I'll help you.</string>
  <string id="6060519">I'm sorry, Lia. It's too dangerous to let Kelder live.</string>
  <string id="6060520">That man has to die.</string>
  <string id="6060524">I'll tear him limb from limb.</string>
  <string id="6060525">That man has to die.</string>
  <string id="6060536">Not hard enough, so it seems.</string>
  <string id="6060537">I'm disgusted by the both of them.</string>
  <string id="6060538">Oh... I suppose that's why he wanted this hushed up.</string>
  <string id="6060539">He's known? And he's been protecting you this whole time?</string>
  <string id="6060540">He can't seriously condone you killing children!</string>
  <string id="6060541">He knew. How long did he think this could go on?</string>
  <string id="6060542">Ooh, a corrupt magistrate. Are we all shocked yet?</string>
  <string id="6060543">So you kill children, and he just looks the other way.</string>
  <string id="6060548">We have to keep moving! There are darkspawn everywhere!</string>
  <string id="6060551">Maker preserve us!</string>
  <string id="6060554">It's obvious that you're not well. You need help.</string>
  <string id="6060555">I feel sorry for you.</string>
  <string id="6060556">No! I'm not mad! It's the demons!</string>

  <string id="6061232">Eyes open. There's Tal-Vashoth here... if you trust that Javaris.</string>
  <string id="6061233">Right. Supposed to be Tal-Vashoth here somewhere.</string>
  <string id="6061234">Be watchful. That Javaris fellow warned of Tal-Vashoth.</string>
  <string id="6061235">So, friend Javaris, where are your Tal-Vashoth, I wonder?</string>
  <string id="6061239">Done, for better or not. The dwarf will be at the compound.</string>
  <string id="6061240">Well, that was fun. The dwarf will be at the compound, if you're set on it.</string>
  <string id="6061241">Killed the lot. I bet that dwarf is waiting at the compound.</string>
  <string id="6061242">Done, for better or not. The dwarf will be at the compound.</string>
  <string id="6061243">Done, for better or not. The dwarf will be at the compound.</string>
  <string id="6061244">Killed the lot. I bet that dwarf is waiting at the compound.</string>
  <string id="6061245">Done, for better or not. The dwarf will be at the compound.</string>
  <string id="6061246">No more Tal-Vashoth. Shall we meet that dwarf again at the compound?</string>
  <string id="6061247">There's your dead Tal-Vashoth. I imagine the dwarf is waiting at the compound.</string>
  <string id="6061249">Head back to the barracks to find Donnic so Aveline can talk to him.</string>
  <string id="6061271">Do you hate me so much? I can't believe you did that.</string>
  <string id="6061274">I can't believe you didn't.</string>
  <string id="6061277">I... I have to fix this. He'll file a complaint... ask for a transfer.</string>
  <string id="6061280">You! You're coming to the barracks to explain why you put him on the spot!</string>
  <string id="6061283">Double time, Hawke, or so help me...</string>
  <string id="6061295">Aveline and Donnic are now dating.</string>
  <string id="6061328">And who will lead us into this battle? You?</string>
  <string id="6061331">I will fight to defend this city, as I have always done!</string>
  <string id="6061334">To control it, you mean! I won't have our lives tossed to the flames to feed your vanity!</string>
  <string id="6061335">We need to work together, not kill each other while we figure out who leads!</string>
  <string id="6061336">Stop arguing!</string>
  <string id="6061337">Then perhaps you should be leading us.</string>
  <string id="6061340">What? He isn't even of this city!</string>
  <string id="6061343">What? She isn't even of this city!</string>
  <string id="6061346">You place us in dangerous hands.</string>
  <string id="6061349">You? You're not even of this city!</string>
  <string id="6061352">Neither am I, yet I don't hear you complaining about us both fighting to defend our home.</string>
  <string id="6061355">Very well, then. But whatever you plan, be quick about it.</string>
  <string id="6061358">This should be interesting.</string>
  <string id="6061361">Why am I not surprised?</string>
  <string id="6061367">Or we could find out what they're up to. That works, too.</string>
  <string id="6061380">Gamlen</string>
  <string id="6061384">Gamlen</string>
  <string id="6061388">Gamlen</string>
  <string id="6061395">Are you the comtesse? We need to talk.</string>
  <string id="6061396">Good evening, Comtesse.</string>
  <string id="6061399">Another round?</string>
  <string id="6061402">Maker, yes!</string>
  <string id="6061414">So, Aveline is great!</string>
  <string id="6061417">Look, if this was all a plan for you to get closer to the captain, maybe you should just talk to her.</string>
  <string id="6061418">Look, if this was all an attempt to get closer to me through the captain, you're just not my type.</string>
  <string id="6061423">Bodahn</string>
  <string id="6061607">When I bought this place, I didn't think I'd be sharing it with my sister's whole blighted family.</string>
  <string id="6061633">Sandal</string>
  <string id="6061671">Mother</string>
  <string id="6061673">Captain Wright</string>
  <string id="6061684">Lady inside killed herself. We'll be investigating.</string>
  <string id="6061696">Emile de Launcet?</string>
  <string id="6061727">No... Not her. I can't do this.</string>
  <string id="6061732">Mother</string>
  <string id="6061763">There seem to be a great many Qunari at the Keep's entrance.</string>
  <string id="6061766">Then they've already taken it over. Clearly they've been planning this for some time.</string>
  <string id="6061769">Either that or we're the pushovers they think we are.</string>
  <string id="6061772">Perhaps we should have been planning, ourselves.</string>
  <string id="6061775">I don't see any of my guardsmen.</string>
  <string id="6061778">This is the only way in. We must assault them now, before their numbers grow.</string>
  <string id="6061781">Are you mad? They have hostages! We need a distraction.</string>
  <string id="6061784">I am in charge, and I refuse to play games. We attack.</string>
  <string id="6061785">Let's do it.</string>
  <string id="6061786">I agree with Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6061787">If we work together, we can do it.</string>
  <string id="6061788">I agree with Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6061789">Nothing like the direct approach.</string>
  <string id="6061790">I agree with Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6061791">We need a distraction.</string>
  <string id="6061792">Orsino is right.</string>
  <string id="6061793">As you wish.</string>
  <string id="6061794">This is no time for games. We must act, or all within will die.</string>
  <string id="6061795">The first enchanter has the right idea.</string>
  <string id="6061796">It's Orsino's decision.</string>
  <string id="6061797">A distraction sounds like the safer choice.</string>
  <string id="6061798">It's Orsino's decision.</string>
  <string id="6061799">Playing games sounds good to me.</string>
  <string id="6061800">It's Orsino's decision.</string>
  <string id="6061801">We can't risk a distraction.</string>
  <string id="6061802">Meredith is right.</string>
  <string id="6061803">It seems I am overruled.</string>
  <string id="6061804">Decide quickly. We have no time.</string>
  <string id="6061805">We need to get inside now.</string>
  <string id="6061806">We attack.</string>
  <string id="6061807">We can't risk a distraction.</string>
  <string id="6061808">We attack.</string>
  <string id="6061809">You win. We'll do it your way.</string>
  <string id="6061810">We attack.</string>
  <string id="6061811">Let's follow Orsino's plan.</string>
  <string id="6061812">We need a distraction.</string>
  <string id="6061813">A direct assault is too risky.</string>
  <string id="6061814">We need a distraction.</string>
  <string id="6061815">Let's hear what you have in mind, Orsino.</string>
  <string id="6061816">We need a distraction.</string>
  <string id="6061817">I told them not to do it, I swear!</string>
  <string id="6061822">What are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="6061823">Kidnapping?</string>
  <string id="6061824">We weren't going to hurt her.</string>
  <string id="6061827">Just make sure you left us alone. Do you understand?</string>
  <string id="6061830">Return to Main Menu.</string>
  <string id="6061831">No</string>
  <string id="6061832">Desperate Refugee</string>

  <string id="6061842">Ser Alrik</string>
  <string id="6061847">No... please! I haven't done anything wrong.</string>
  <string id="6061851">That's a lie. What do we do to mages who lie?</string>
  <string id="6061854">You fiends will never touch a mage again!</string>
  <string id="6061866">Merchant's Key</string>
  <string id="6061926">And just how will we do this?</string>
  <string id="6061929">Have confidence, Knight-Commander.</string>
  <string id="6062000">What plot would you like to set?</string>
  <string id="6062004">One of mine?</string>
  <string id="6062008">Take Aveline and follow Guardsman Donnic’s patrol through the Docks at night.</string>
  <string id="6062035">Donnic's Patrol</string>
  <string id="6062036">Donnic's Patrol</string>
  <string id="6062053">I'm not your enemy in this. I think Meredith is a dangerous zealot.</string>
  <string id="6062054">I agree.</string>
  <string id="6062055">Then talk to Thrask. He would welcome your aid!</string>
  <string id="6062058">Our main base is on the Wounded Coast, an old ruin. They should all be there. Your friend too.</string>
  <string id="6062061">I promise you, Meredith is the only one we're trying to harm.</string>
  <string id="6062076">Serah Hawke! Or is it always Champion now? You're too much of a chameleon, my friend.</string>
  <string id="6062077">Well now. What is the Champion doing on my patrol?</string>
  <string id="6062081">City Guardsman</string>
  <string id="6062083">City Guardsman</string>
  <string id="6062087">I... I'm sorry. Grace used blood magic to hold him. There's no other way to wake him up.</string>
  <string id="6062088">Never mind, Donnic. I need to know if Aveline is giving you easy patrols.</string>
  <string id="6062089">Is Aveline coddling you?</string>
  <string id="6062090">Did I make this seem that easy? I assure you, my wife gives me no special treatment.</string>
  <string id="6062103">The complaints about Aveline are clearly false. Go to the Gallows and speak with Cullen.</string>
  <string id="6062112">The Arishok may not like you, or anyone, but he seems to respect your ability. Will you help present this to him?</string>
  <string id="6062115">The Champion's a fine lady, ser. She wanted to solve this peacefully.</string>
  <string id="6062118">The Champion's a good man, ser. He tried to solve things peacefully.</string>
  <string id="6062121">Grunts Put the mage to questioning.</string>
  <string id="6062122">The boy stood up to his elders when they would have killed an innocent hostage.</string>
  <string id="6062123">Don't hurt Alain.</string>
  <string id="6062124">The boy's been working with blood mages since he was in swaddling clothes.</string>
  <string id="6062125">He's one of Grace's.</string>
  <string id="6062126">No! I stood up for you! I—</string>
  <string id="6062129">Take him away.</string>
  <string id="6062132">Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6062155">It's not done.</string>
  <string id="6062171">I'd wrap up any other business before we go. It's already a mess, and could get worse.</string>
  <string id="6062174">Take Aveline to Lowtown at night and speak with Guardsman Brennan about the unfounded complaints coming out of the district.</string>
  <string id="6062175">Concerned that he couldn't control his alter ego, Vengeance, Anders left and went into hiding.</string>
  <string id="6062178">I could not have lived with myself if I had that girl's blood on my hands.</string>
  <string id="6062183">That girl's blood is on my hands. I don't know how I can live with that.</string>
  <string id="6062215">Where in the plot?</string>
  <string id="6062216">Start of the plot</string>
  <string id="6062217">Start of the plot</string>

  <string id="6062286">Bartrand's Estate</string>
  <string id="6062345">The people of Kirkwall trust you, Champion. They will be more honest for you than for us.</string>
  <string id="6062368">People work where they can. Even here.</string>
  <string id="6062370">What a terrible place to get lost... not that there are many good places for that, I guess.</string>
  <string id="6062371">This ground is cursed. Only wretched or ignorant souls would linger here.</string>
  <string id="6062372">You take me to all the nice places.</string>
  <string id="6062373">Hubert's miners must be a desperate lot to work here.</string>

  <string id="6062688">Why don't you start small, and leave the chains for when you're more experienced?</string>
  <string id="6062689">Chains, huh?</string>

  <string id="6062758">Maraas</string>
  <string id="6062763">Shanedan, Serah Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6062773">I thought I killed all the Qunari. Do I know you?</string>
  <string id="6062776">Thought I scared the Qunari off. Do I know you?</string>
  <string id="6062779">You look familiar, Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6062782">A face to forget, but... do I know you, Qunari?</string>
  <string id="6062785">Tal-Vashoth, once of the Wounded Coast. I had left my fellows. You convinced me to turn on them.</string>
  <string id="6062788">It was long ago. I am now Maraas, mercenary of Kirkwall. Time has been kind to your name, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6062789">Do I have to worry about this old scar?</string>
  <string id="6062790">Do you hold a grudge?</string>
  <string id="6062791">I felt no kinship to those dead when they lived. You pushed, but the killing was my choice.</string>
  <string id="6062792">Does Maraas mean something?</string>
  <string id="6062793">You chose your name?</string>
  <string id="6062794">It means nothing. I have no role, except for what I choose.</string>
  <string id="6062797">Is that good or bad?</string>
  <string id="6062800">It just is.</string>
  <string id="6062801">I'm surprised to see any Qunari or Tal-Vashoth in the city.</string>
  <string id="6062802">There are few of you left.</string>
  <string id="6062803">When the Arishok withdrew, only Tal-Vashoth remained. Many were killed by humans blind to the difference.</string>
  <string id="6062806">The Qunari died with the Arishok, as they believed they were meant to. Many Tal-Vashoth were also killed, just in case.</string>
  <string id="6062809">Time has calmed those fears. Now I am hired as much for my appearance as my skill.</string>
  <string id="6062812">Life is comfortably empty. I see the appeal.</string>
  <string id="6062813">So, interested in some work?</string>
  <string id="6062814">Are you available for hire?</string>
  <string id="6062815">Yes, but not with you.</string>
  <string id="6062818">Why?</string>
  <string id="6062821">I do not work for those with titles. They do not have jobs, they have causes.</string>
  <string id="6062824">When you stand for more, more stand against you.</string>
  <string id="6062825">Farewell, then.</string>
  <string id="6062826">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="6062827">Panahedan, Serah Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6062833">Interesting times, Serah Hawke. As they must be.</string>
  <string id="6062834">Bone Pit Mines</string>
  <string id="6062987">Dragons! Babies, I think. They must be what attacked the miners.</string>
  <string id="6062988">Dragons! Much smaller than the one that witch turned into.</string>
  <string id="6062989">When I tell the tale of slaying these dragons, I'll make them three times taller!</string>
  <string id="6062990">Oh, look at them! They're like kittens... who want to eat you.</string>
  <string id="6062991">If there's offspring, there's a guardian. Be sure of that.</string>
  <string id="6062992">Dragons! Looks like there's a nest in here.</string>
  <string id="6062997">Qunari</string>
  <string id="6062999">Hideout Location Map</string>
  <string id="6063077">I don't care what business you think you have here, basra. The Arishok will not be disturbed at this hour.</string>
  <string id="6063078">The Arishok will not see anyone at this hour.</string>
  <string id="6063079">It is dark. Go away, basra vashedan.</string>
  <string id="6063080">Thrask's Letter</string>
  <string id="6063268">What plot flag would you like to set?</string>
  <string id="6063269">Getting the letter notification.</string>
  <string id="6063270">Getting the letter.</string>
  <string id="6063550">And if it's genuine?</string>
  <string id="6063555">Then he should have come himself.</string>
  <string id="6063556">Chest</string>
  <string id="6063643">Huh. I think this is Bartrand's place. Varric'll want to check this out.</string>
  <string id="6063666">Hawke Estate</string>
  <string id="6063670">Bartrand's Estate</string>
  <string id="6063735">Guard</string>
  <string id="6063746">Among the Shadows</string>
  <string id="6063750">I cannot serve the templars so long as Meredith remains in charge.</string>
  <string id="6063753">I have never been so glad to no longer be a templar.</string>
  <string id="6063756">Thank you for my life, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6063759">And thank you for your efforts against Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6063760">Perhaps one day you will open your eyes to Meredith's corruption.</string>
  <string id="6063761">You need to go to Darktown and find out if anybody has any information on the guardsman Cordy.</string>
  <string id="6063762">You saved Mad Morty from Booker's thugs. Morton has revealed you should travel to the Undercity and visit Three Spear Alley</string>
  <string id="6063763">You dealt with Booker and discovered you must go further into the Undercity to find the mysterious cowled figure. He's at Jonas's Demise.</string>
  <string id="6063764">You killed the cowled figure - it was a talking darkspawn, a disciple. You should report back to Lieutenant Jalen.</string>
  <string id="6063765">Lieutenant Jalen rewarded you for getting revenge for Cordy.</string>
  <string id="6063771"> Look at this! My own sun-shield and all the lyrium I can quaff. You've done me a good one.</string>
  <string id="6063779">Thrask's dead, Grace is dead, and nothing's changed.</string>
  <string id="6063782">They're not going to be the last ones who rebel.</string>
  <string id="6063783">One of the Darktown residents said that an old beggar, Mad Morty, was rambling about a guardsman that got stabbed. You should talk to him.</string>
  <string id="6063786">Speak to Anders at his clinic in the Undercity.</string>
  <string id="6063787">Help Anders collect some potion ingredients: a powder the Tevinters call sela petrae, which forms in sewage, and a yellowish rock called drakestone, which is available in mines and dragon lairs.</string>
  <string id="6063792">Go to the chantry and distract the grand cleric so Anders can complete his plan.</string>
  <string id="6063797">With some help, Anders succeeded at sneaking into the chantry.</string>
  <string id="6063816">You have found the cowled figure. Kill him.</string>
  <string id="6063820">The magistrate can sod off. I won't let a murderer walk.</string>
  <string id="6063821">Better men have tried. And failed. Horribly.</string>
  <string id="6063822">I must do what is right.</string>
  <string id="6063837">You must have heard of my sister as well, then.</string>
  <string id="6063838">And what about Bethany?</string>
  <string id="6063839">Only a little. She is certainly welcome to come, but I'll leave that up to you.</string>
  <string id="6063842">Frankly, I'd rather you take the credit.</string>
  <string id="6063845">Madam! Your secrets are safe with me.</string>
  <string id="6063848">Find out what he's offering. We need a way into this expedition.</string>
  <string id="6063849">You must have heard of my brother as well, then.</string>
  <string id="6063850">And what about Carver?</string>
  <string id="6063851">A little, yes, but it is you they speak most of, messere.</string>
  <string id="6063854">That figures.</string>
  <string id="6063857">Your brother is certainly welcome to join us, by all means, but I'll leave that in your hands.</string>
  <string id="6063860">Oh, I'm going. Without this expedition, we won't last out the year.</string>
  <string id="6063861">It won't be easy, but it's a chance. I think we have to take it.</string>
  <string id="6063867">Come on, the dwarf makes some sense. No offense.</string>
  <string id="6063870">Look, you started this—and it's a good idea. Certainly better than ending up in the Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6063876">You'll die for murdering my boy! I'll kill you myself!</string>
  <string id="6063908">You know why I'm here, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6063911">My son is dead, and I know your hand held the blade.</string>
  <string id="6063948">Your son was alive when I last saw him, six years ago.</string>
  <string id="6063949">I never hurt Kelder.</string>
  <string id="6063950">There must have been a line a mile long for that privilege.</string>
  <string id="6063951">You have a lot of suspects?</string>
  <string id="6063952">Someone should have strung that bastard up years ago.</string>
  <string id="6063953">It's about time.</string>
  <string id="6063960">Things are heating up. It's a good time not to be a templar.</string>
  <string id="6063964">Ain't never going to be a place for me in the templars, not while she's running the show.</string>
  <string id="6063996">I wish I was a dung-scooper's son. The elves would have killed me long ago.</string>
  <string id="6064004">Of course!</string>
  <string id="6064020">But we heard you're going into the Deep Roads. Surely you'll need all the help you can—</string>
  <string id="6064023">Look, we know you're going into the Deep Roads. You'll need to hire the best and we're—</string>
  <string id="6064026">You're too late! Already done!</string>
  <string id="6064029">What are we supposed to do now?</string>
  <string id="6064032">Athenril kept the templars off our backs last year, but... we can't do it alone.</string>
  <string id="6064033">Well. Back to waiting for someone to turn us in.</string>
  <string id="6064036">Working for scum, dogged by templars. How many other refugees have just disappeared in the last year?</string>
  <string id="6064037">One way or another, we're getting into this expedition.</string>
  <string id="6064038">I'll change Bartrand's mind.</string>
  <string id="6064039">I wouldn't count on that.</string>
  <string id="6064042">I'm not holding my breath.</string>
  <string id="6064045">We've made a name for ourselves this last year. We'll find something.</string>
  <string id="6064046">We'll be fine.</string>
  <string id="6064047">We have to...</string>
  <string id="6064050">We haven't made a name until people start coming to us.</string>
  <string id="6064053">It's not every day you get a chance to head into the Deep Roads, right?</string>
  <string id="6064054">It was worth a shot.</string>
  <string id="6064055">We missed out on a treasure-filled paradise, I'm sure.</string>
  <string id="6064058">Mmm, not every day. And not today, apparently.</string>
  <string id="6064061">I hear Aveline's with the city guard, now. Maybe we should check with her.</string>
  <string id="6064062">Isn't Aveline with the city guard now? Maybe she has something—anything—worthwhile.</string>
  <string id="6064065">Please...</string>
  <string id="6064067">Ready for Sundermount.</string>

  <string id="6064088">Let me know as soon as you're ready and we'll head out.</string>
  <string id="6064091">Stand down, Grace!</string>
  <string id="6064095">Get Aveline in my active party.</string>
  <string id="6064096">Aveline in party</string>

  <string id="6064104">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6064109">She might survive the blight, but at the cost of becoming a Grey Warden. It's not an easy life. Trust me.</string>
  <string id="6064111">The knight-commander will never change.</string>
  <string id="6064112">You have agreed to meet Donnic for drinks.</string>

  <string id="6064156">There is another door that leads into the paths far above us. That is what you seek.</string>
  <string id="6064159">It has been sealed, however, and cannot be opened without a key.</string>

  <string id="6064419">Magistrate Vanard</string>
  <string id="6064519">I'm sorry. I heard Magistrate Vanard blamed you for Kelder's death.</string>
  <string id="6064522">I'm the one he should have come after.</string>
  <string id="6064523">You're talking like you know me.</string>
  <string id="6064524">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="6064525">I'm Lia. You... saved my life. When Kelder kidnapped me.</string>
  <string id="6064528">My father took me away from Kirkwall, but I always wanted to come back to thank you.</string>
  <string id="6064529">I'm sorry, Lia. I should have taken care of him back then.</string>
  <string id="6064530">I should have killed him.</string>
  <string id="6064531">When you were a girl, you begged me to spare him. Why the change of heart?</string>
  <string id="6064532">What happened?</string>
  <string id="6064533">I felt sorry for him. He seemed so miserable. I believed him about the demons.</string>
  <string id="6064536">I've spent the last six years in every Circle library in the Free Marches. There were no demons.</string>
  <string id="6064539">He was just a monster. And now he'll never hurt anyone again.</string>
  <string id="6064548">Champion! It's Lia! Do you remember me? You saved me from that murderer when I was kid.</string>
  <string id="6064551">Sorry Captain. I don' t mean to—</string>
  <string id="6064554">Not at all. Go on.</string>
  <string id="6064557">I wanted to say thank you. I wasn't thinking straight the day you saved me. That monster deserved what he got.</string>
  <string id="6064560">Captain.</string>
  <string id="6064563">Dismissed.</string>
  <string id="6064569">She joined the guard a few months back. She's got a good understanding of what we're up against.</string>
  <string id="6064575">Lia</string>
  <string id="6064578">Since you're turning to me, should I assume the templars all suddenly disappeared?</string>
  <string id="6064579">Can't your templars do it?</string>
  <string id="6064586">I said, Great, I'll go talk to them. Didn't go over well.</string>
  <string id="6064589">Sounds like you want a chance to show otherwise.</string>
  <string id="6064590">You can prove you are better.</string>
  <string id="6064591">Do I really have to convince you to do the right thing?</string>
  <string id="6064592">So you won't help?</string>
  <string id="6064593">I have already done more than was demanded, by my own choice.</string>
  <string id="6064597">No.</string>
  <string id="6064603">You do not approve of my methods, but perhaps you will change your mind when you see, firsthand, how dangerous these apostates are.</string>
  <string id="6064619">Activate or remove Aveline, talk to her, or put her in the party.</string>
  <string id="6064620">Deal with Aveline</string>
  <string id="6064621">How so?</string>
  <string id="6064622">Make Aveline talk using her stubbed in dialogue rather than her regular dialogue.</string>
  <string id="6064623">Talk to Aveline</string>
  <string id="6064624">Activate or remove Aveline, talk to her, or put her in the party.</string>

  <string id="6064626">How so?</string>
  <string id="6064627">Make Aveline talk using her stubbed in dialogue rather than her regular dialogue.</string>
  <string id="6064628">Talk to Aveline</string>
  <string id="6064629">Deal with the fact that Aveline is a follower but I can't add her stubbed in dialogue to the real thing just now, and that the follower system isn't really implemented.</string>
  <string id="6064630">Deal with Aveline</string>
  <string id="6064631">How so?</string>
  <string id="6064632">Make Aveline talk using her stubbed in dialogue rather than her regular dialogue.</string>
  <string id="6064633">Talk to Aveline</string>
  <string id="6064636">You sure you know what mercenary means?</string>
  <string id="6064639">Taking payment to face Tal-Vashoth only proves that I have sold the last of myself.</string>
  <string id="6064640">These are facts I cannot deny.</string>
  <string id="6064643">Seems to me, the last man standing gets final say on who is right or wrong.</string>
  <string id="6064646">There is... an appeal to that. The leader of these Tal-Vashoth, he is worth killing.</string>
  <string id="6064647">Go back.</string>
  <string id="6064648">Go back.</string>
  <string id="6064651"> I know what I am. I don't need to belabor it.</string>
  <string id="6064652">Have the templars spoken to her?</string>
  <string id="6064653">What does Nyssa know?</string>
  <string id="6064654">What have they said to the templars?</string>
  <string id="6064655">Have they been questioned?</string>
  <string id="6064656">The comte and comtesse say they have not seen Emile since he was a child.</string>
  <string id="6064659">I... will help you.</string>
  <string id="6064665">The path to the camp is obvious, human. I will meet you there.</string>
  <string id="6064666">Are the apostates blood mages?</string>
  <string id="6064667">Is blood magic involved?</string>
  <string id="6064668">The knight-commander suspects this, yes.</string>
  <string id="6064671">The knight-commander tends to assume all apostates practice blood magic. She prefers to err on the side of caution.</string>
  <string id="6064674">Oh, this is going to be great.</string>
  <string id="6064675">I hope you know what you're doing.</string>
  <string id="6064676">Well, nothing can go wrong setting him loose, hmm?</string>
  <string id="6064677">I'm not sure that was wise.</string>
  <string id="6064678">Hope you know what you're doing.</string>
  <string id="6064679">We need this kind of help?</string>
  <string id="6064680">I don't know if that was wise.</string>
  <string id="6064681">Hope you know what you're doing.</string>
  <string id="6064686">This was an interesting fight, human. I think I will like choosing my battles from now on. I... thank you... for the opportunity.</string>
  <string id="6064699">Huon was taken many years ago. Most of the alienage's inhabitants do not even know him. </string>
  <string id="6064700">Tell me what you know about Emile.</string>
  <string id="6064701">Let's talk about Emile.</string>
  <string id="6064702">What do you know about Evelina?</string>
  <string id="6064703">Who is Evelina?</string>
  <string id="6064706">You look lovely tonight, my lady.</string>
  <string id="6064709">Oh, you are too kind! I am so honored to have the Champion in my home!</string>
  <string id="6064714">Oh! But the Hanged Man is so filthy! Chuckles</string>
  <string id="6064715">They are so Orlesian.</string>
  <string id="6064717">Did you really escape the Circle so you could kiss a girl?</string>
  <string id="6064718">Is this real? </string>
  <string id="6064719">Well, not just that. I've read so much about the other things you can do with girls.</string>
  <string id="6064722">This is an act. The mage makes himself out to be harmless.</string>
  <string id="6064725">No, I think he's really that pathetic.</string>
  <string id="6064726">I just don't want to die a virgin!</string>
  <string id="6064727">Putting on an act requires intelligence. Conclusion? He's not acting.</string>
  <string id="6064728">Sighs Just go, do... whatever.</string>
  <string id="6064734">Shut up, Cricket! Don't tell them that!</string>
  <string id="6064738">Do the templars know you're here?</string>
  <string id="6064739">Does anyone know about you?</string>
  <string id="6064740">They don't care. They only want Evelina.</string>
  <string id="6064743">I miss her.</string>
  <string id="6064770">Bartrand</string>
  <string id="6064784">Oh, Varric! Please forgive me, my brother. I was just jealous of you.</string>
  <string id="6064832">When the templars came, I told them the truth—I hadn't seen Huon in ten years.</string>
  <string id="6064835">So you hadn't seen him since he left you.</string>
  <string id="6064836">Ten years is a long time.</string>
  <string id="6064837">Huon didn't leave me. He was taken away.</string>
  <string id="6064840">Good riddance. You don't need to be tied down to some man.</string>
  <string id="6064841">You're better off without him.</string>
  <string id="6064845">If he had been himself, I would have taken him back gladly!</string>
  <string id="6064850">How could I ever compete with you for Mother's love?</string>
  <string id="6064854">The blame for everything these mages did can be laid at your feet.</string>
  <string id="6064855">The templars caused this.</string>
  <string id="6064856">Look at the way you treat them. Is it any wonder they're so desperate?</string>
  <string id="6064859">I have heard this argument often.</string>
  <string id="6064862">Maybe they are not corrupt. Maybe they deserve leniency. Maybe they can be saved.</string>
  <string id="6064868">Where is Bartrand now?</string>
  <string id="6064869">We'll take care of this.</string>
  <string id="6064870">You say Bartrand's mad...</string>
  <string id="6064871">Where is Bartrand now?</string>
  <string id="6064872">We'll take care of this.</string>
  <string id="6064873">You say Bartrand is mad...</string>
  <string id="6064883">I'm the mother of your grandchild, that's who.</string>
  <string id="6064887">I won't tell anyone what you did for Emile.</string>
  <string id="6064888">Thank you for keeping my son alive.</string>
  <string id="6064889">I hate that Meredith. Her face is always sour, like there is something stinky under her nose.</string>
  <string id="6064890">Guillaume and I are very grateful to you, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6064891">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="6064896">What?</string>
  <string id="6064899">Your son, Emile? He did me last night. Got nothing out of it but bite marks and his bastard in my belly.</string>
  <string id="6064902">Oh, Guillaume, she is so foul!</string>
  <string id="6064905">So when's the wedding? When do I get to be Lady Nella de Launcet?</string>
  <string id="6064911">What's wrong with her?</string>
  <string id="6064912">Sighs</string>
  <string id="6064923">That foolish boy.</string>
  <string id="6064924">This is so embarrassing.</string>
  <string id="6064925">Maybe I'll hide the girl on the country estate...</string>
  <string id="6064929">Thank you for all you have done for my family.</string>
  <string id="6064930">I will always be indebted to you, my friend.</string>
  <string id="6064931">Impossible. You could not know so early.</string>
  <string id="6064934">What, are you a midwife? I've been stuck by two dozen men and it never felt like this.</string>
  <string id="6064940">I'm going to be Lady Nella. Chuckles</string>
  <string id="6064941">Oh, I hope Emile doesn't try to escape again.</string>
  <string id="6064953">I'm surprised you would turn to me. We haven't always seen eye to eye.</string>
  <string id="6064954">My help?</string>
  <string id="6064955">I believe the apostates are being sheltered by loved ones. It is understandable, but misguided and very dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6064958">I will force no mage back under your yoke.</string>
  <string id="6064959">I am no ally of yours.</string>
  <string id="6064960">You want my help?</string>
  <string id="6064964">I have asked you to track these fugitives so you might see for yourself what we templars deal with every day.</string>
  <string id="6064967">If you still think them worth our mercy, tell me then.</string>
  <string id="6064968">You will see that imprisonment or death is sometimes the only kindness we can offer.</string>
  <string id="6064971">I know you, of all people, understand the danger such apostates pose.</string>
  <string id="6064974">With the influence you wield in this city, Champion, it is crucial you understand just what we face.</string>
  <string id="6064977">Talk to these mages' families, investigate for yourself whether they need be recaptured.</string>
  <string id="6064987">Qunari Compound</string>
  <string id="6064989">Are you... are you going to arrest him? I think he needs help.</string>
  <string id="6064992">Oh.</string>
  <string id="6065000">That was... satisfying. Is that the word?</string>
  <string id="6065003">Thanks for your help. Now I have a dwarf waiting for me back in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6065007">I hope you'll do the right thing.</string>
  <string id="6065010">She presented herself to the first enchanter on her arrival and asked to take her place here.</string>
  <string id="6065013">The best place to begin your search for the elf Huon is by talking to his wife, Nyssa. She works as a dressmaker in Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6065016">The knight-commander suggests you speak with Emile de Launcet's parents.</string>
  <string id="6065019">We believe Evelina has family among the refugees in Darktown. She may be with them.</string>
  <string id="6065022">Set Aveline active.</string>
  <string id="6065023">Activate Aveline</string>
  <string id="6065030">You think we deserve to live like this? Evelina just wanted to give us the lives we would have had at home.</string>
  <string id="6065035">Set Aveline active.</string>
  <string id="6065036">Activate Aveline</string>
  <string id="6065037">Set Aveline active.</string>
  <string id="6065038">Activate Aveline</string>
  <string id="6065045">Thank you, Sister. It seems I am again in your debt... and shadow.</string>
  <string id="6065046">Thank you, Brother. It seems I am again in your debt... and shadow.</string>
  <string id="6065049">Slaver</string>
  <string id="6065053">Slaver Archer</string>
  <string id="6065055">Bone Pit Mines</string>
  <string id="6065056">Vanard's Ambush</string>
  <string id="6065058">Abandoned Ruins</string>
  <string id="6065065">It led to many more, for many reasons. So no, you and I are not enemies.</string>
  <string id="6065081">I told you I would handle this, and I did! Now, after a year of raids on our shipments, I finally caught one of the culprits!</string>
  <string id="6065084">Lilley is tracking down a lead in Undercity. Were you going to meet her?</string>
  <string id="6065228">Slaver</string>
  <string id="6065230">You're strong and handsome and so very smart!</string>
  <string id="6065238">Slaver Mage</string>
  <string id="6065248">You said he sold the statue? To who?</string>
  <string id="6065249">Where is the statue?</string>
  <string id="6065250">I don't know. It's why we came back to Kirkwall. He was already starting to rant about the sodding idol and its singing.</string>
  <string id="6065253">On his better days, he hated the thing, wanted to get rid of it.</string>
  <string id="6065256">But the minute it was gone, he got worse.</string>
  <string id="6065257">Where is Bartrand now?</string>
  <string id="6065258">We'll take care of this.</string>
  <string id="6065259">You say Bartrand is mad...</string>
  <string id="6065260">And those sodding lunatics just keep prowling the halls.</string>
  <string id="6065270">Why'd you do it, Bartrand? Were you already crazy, before we even went into the Deep Roads? Or was it all the statue?</string>
  <string id="6065273">Idol... Not a statue. It wants to be worshipped. It wants me. It wants me back! She stole it from me!</string>
  <string id="6065276">For this!</string>
  <string id="6065280">Who did you sell the idol to, Bartrand?</string>
  <string id="6065281">Where is the statue?</string>
  <string id="6065282">She glittered like the sun, but her heart was ice.</string>
  <string id="6065285">She will not feed it, not like I did.</string>
  <string id="6065286">The statue did this.</string>
  <string id="6065287">So good to know we can count on you for the clear answers.</string>
  <string id="6065288">That was helpful.</string>
  <string id="6065289">Bartrand was a bastard when he sealed us in the Deep Roads, but he wasn't a madman.</string>
  <string id="6065290">It's the statue.</string>
  <string id="6065291">Bloody ancestors! Why bring me this close and still nothing?</string>
  <string id="6065294">Boy, he has changed.</string>
  <string id="6065295">He doesn't want money?</string>
  <string id="6065296">You're not getting any answers.</string>
  <string id="6065297">He's too far gone.</string>
  <string id="6065298">For three years, all I've wanted is to look him in the eye and get his answers. Why he abandoned us in that thaig. What any of this was for.</string>
  <string id="6065307">Right. Still going to feel good pulling that trigger...</string>
  <string id="6065310">No! I've been counting the days until I could put a bolt in his conniving little brain.</string>
  <string id="6065316">It's not just us! Look what he did out there! How many more people will die for his folly?</string>
  <string id="6065317">He has to be stopped. There are other ways than murder.</string>
  <string id="6065318">He doesn't need to die.</string>
  <string id="6065319">Fine. We'll have to... lock him away somewhere. I'll send somebody to get him.</string>
  <string id="6065322">He's clearly past saving. Make it clean.</string>
  <string id="6065323">You're right.</string>
  <string id="6065324">I wish I could have done it before I had to see you like this. Goodbye, Bartrand.</string>
  <string id="6065338">I can't do it, Hawke. I thought I could.</string>
  <string id="6065341">I thought he'd be gloating, lying on a bed of gold and commissioning painters to memorialize the instant he sealed us into the Deep Roads.</string>
  <string id="6065344">But look at him. Whatever that idol was, it did worse to him than I ever could.</string>
  <string id="6065388">You heard Anders, he's possessed. As long as he lives, he's a threat to everyone around him.</string>
  <string id="6065389">He has to die.</string>
  <string id="6065393">I'm sorry, Bartrand. I owe this to everyone you betrayed.</string>
  <string id="6065396">You'll sleep easier without his blood on your hands.</string>
  <string id="6065397">You're right.</string>
  <string id="6065600">Formari Herbalist</string>
  <string id="6065635">Go to the sewers to find the sela petrae for Anders's potion.</string>
  <string id="6065636">Go to the Bone Pit mines to find some drakestone for Anders's potion.</string>
  <string id="6065643">Drakestone Deposit</string>
  <string id="6065648">Champion! Have you found any new wondrous materials in your travels?</string>
  <string id="6065652">Trust me, things could be worse. Tell me how to stop the next ambush.</string>
  <string id="6065653">Make it easy on yourself.</string>
  <string id="6065654">What made you betray your employer?</string>
  <string id="6065655">Why did you do it?</string>
  <string id="6065656">Before the Blight, my family had a good life in Lothering: clean home, fertile land, friends...</string>
  <string id="6065659">In Kirkwall we lived in a hovel. People spit on us. And some days we went hungry.</string>
  <string id="6065675">Ah, my young friend. How goes the search?</string>
  <string id="6065701">The Docks (Night)</string>
  <string id="6065703">Shall I list the names of the wives, sons, and daughters of the men killed in the attacks?</string>
  <string id="6065739">Sela Petrae Deposit</string>
  <string id="6065741">But I gave my life to the Bone Pit, like so many others...</string>
  <string id="6065759">We held back the dragons so the survivors could take shelter in the mines. Now we're clearing a way out of here.</string>
  <string id="6065779">Robart? I thought you were dead. You were watching for dragons. Why didn't you warn us?</string>
  <string id="6065788">Cara, I... I've got new orders now.</string>
  <string id="6065794">You say the Arishok left Kirkwall with the relic, but I know for a fact that's not true.</string>
  <string id="6065797">Oh, he did, but Isabela stole it again three days later.</string>
  <string id="6065800">I heard she jumped into the sea to get away. Might even be true. Either way, we didn't see her again.</string>
  <string id="6065803">Interesting. The stories I've heard don't mention that part.</string>
  <string id="6065806">Stories are like that.</string>
  <string id="6065809">The Champion killed the Arishok in single combat? It just sounds so... romantic.</string>
  <string id="6065812">It just seems so unbelievable. I would have assumed the stories were exaggerated.</string>
  <string id="6065815">If I didn't know better, I'd say you're developing a little crush.</string>
  <string id="6065818">Don't be ridiculous. The Champion just seems very… heroic in your tale.</string>
  <string id="6065821">Why? Because I have respect for a woman who built herself from nothing?</string>
  <string id="6065824">Mm-hmm.</string>
  <string id="6065827">So what happened next?</string>
  <string id="6065830">How about I skip to the reason you came here? We've been talking for hours—you must be bored by now.</string>
  <string id="6065833">No, I'm curious. Was the Champion rewarded? Kirkwall must have been grateful.</string>
  <string id="6065836">But you came here to ask about the rebellion.</string>
  <string id="6065839">Very well. Tell me what happened that night.</string>
  <string id="6065840">Hubert? You knew about the dragons?</string>
  <string id="6065843">Just calm down and you'll be well compensated.</string>
  <string id="6065883">Mistress Hawke, I must speak with you.</string>
  <string id="6065886">Master Hawke, I must speak with you.</string>
  <string id="6065889">You're the only one that can help.</string>
  <string id="6065892">The Wardens mounted an expedition to retrace your route through the Deep Roads to discover whatever it is you found years ago.</string>
  <string id="6065895">It's a fool's errand, and my poor brother is with them—Nathaniel Howe.</string>
  <string id="6065904">Nathaniel? Well, put me in a dress and call me a templar. How is the old boy doing?</string>
  <string id="6065907">He's missing, serah. Haven't you been listening?</string>
  <string id="6065910">I'm not worried about Nathaniel. He's crawled out of worse places alive.</string>
  <string id="6065915">I take it you and Nathaniel have some history.</string>
  <string id="6065916">Anders, you know Nathaniel?</string>
  <string id="6065917">Certainly. We were in the Wardens together in Amaranthine.</string>
  <string id="6065920">Hordes of darkspawn, psychotic broodmothers—usual Warden business.</string>
  <string id="6065923">I wonder if Nathaniel ever found a sense of humor?</string>
  <string id="6065924">Are you related to Arl Rendon Howe? The butcher of Denerim?</string>
  <string id="6065925">I've heard of the Howes.</string>
  <string id="6065926">Much to my shame, I am. But do not blame the children for the sins of the father.</string>
  <string id="6065929">Nathaniel is a good man worth saving.</string>
  <string id="6065930">Wardens range into the Deep Roads all the time.</string>
  <string id="6065931">Why do you need my help?</string>
  <string id="6065932">I'd tell the Wardens, but by the time I reach Vigil's Keep... My poor brother.</string>
  <string id="6065933">Why were Wardens interested in our expedition?</string>
  <string id="6065934">Why follow my trail?</string>
  <string id="6065935">Maker help me, I have no idea. My brother never tells me these things.</string>
  <string id="6065936">Your brother and the Wardens will have to take care of themselves.</string>
  <string id="6065937">I can't be bothered with this.</string>
  <string id="6065938">If you change your mind, serah, please retrace your steps in the Deep Roads.</string>
  <string id="6065941">Do you know any other details?</string>
  <string id="6065942">Tell me more.</string>
  <string id="6065943">I know almost nothing. Nathaniel never speaks about the Wardens.</string>
  <string id="6065946">It was only happenstance that I heard your name mentioned.</string>
  <string id="6065949">Please, go back to the Deep Roads.</string>
  <string id="6065952">Find my brother. You must!</string>
  <string id="6065955">Any idea what really went on with him and that statue?</string>
  <string id="6065956">What do you think happened?</string>
  <string id="6065957">The thing must be cursed. I don't know if it's magic or demons or the bile of the ancestors. But I think curse about covers it.</string>
  <string id="6065960">If we're lucky, whoever he sold it to had the damn thing melted down for scrap.</string>
  <string id="6065961">He chose to steal the damned thing. He brought it on himself.</string>
  <string id="6065964">Nella</string>
  <string id="6065967">Whatever that idol did to him, it found something inside I don't think even he knew was there.</string>
  <string id="6066030">You've brought back everything on the list. I'll get to work immediately! And of course, here is the reward I promised!</string>
  <string id="6066036">Thank you, my friend! Only one thing on the list left to find!</string>
  <string id="6066109">Maker's blessing on you, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6066113">Your grandparents would be so proud of you.</string>
  <string id="6066136">What do you want to do?</string>
  <string id="6066137">Set plot states</string>
  <string id="6066138">Set plot states</string>
  <string id="6066139">Choose plot state to change</string>
  <string id="6066140">Mine Massacre (merchant plots)</string>
  <string id="6066141">Mine Massacre done</string>
  <string id="6066143">Jump to plot point</string>
  <string id="6066144">Where in the plot?</string>
  <string id="6066145">Start of the plot</string>
  <string id="6066146">Start of the plot</string>

  <string id="6066152">To the Chantry</string>
  <string id="6066153">Return</string>
  <string id="6066154">Return</string>
  <string id="6066155">Exit</string>
  <string id="6066156">Exit</string>
  <string id="6066165">Send Aveline back to camp.</string>
  <string id="6066166">Remove Aveline</string>
  <string id="6066167">Send Aveline back to camp.</string>
  <string id="6066168">Remove Aveline</string>
  <string id="6066169">Send Aveline back to camp.</string>
  <string id="6066170">Remove Aveline</string>
  <string id="6066171">Just a few short years and the Deep Roads are crawling with darkspawn again. Delightful.</string>
  <string id="6066172">If it's this bad a scant few years after the Blight, in a decade this place will be a nightmare.</string>
  <string id="6066173">The darkspawn numbers have grown. This may get tricky.</string>
  <string id="6066174">Looks like we're in for a tough fight. Good. I was getting bored.</string>
  <string id="6066182">Nathaniel Howe?</string>
  <string id="6066185">You're the Champion of Kirkwall, aren't you?</string>
  <string id="6066188">Your handiwork here is much appreciated. How did you...?</string>
  <string id="6066191">Delilah.</string>
  <string id="6066194">She figured things out, then? Good.</string>
  <string id="6066197">I should have spoken to you. The deep roads have proved to be quite dangerous. Your insight could have saved lives.</string>
  <string id="6066198">Find Brimstone</string>
  <string id="6066199">Find Brimstone</string>
  <string id="6066200">Find Sal Petrae</string>
  <string id="6066201">Find Sal Petrae</string>
  <string id="6066265">But that makes no sense. The Champion was on good terms with Knight-Commander Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6066268">But why would Knight-Commander Meredith be so reckless? It makes no sense.</string>
  <string id="6066271">You're lying to me again, aren't you?</string>
  <string id="6066274">Let's say I tell you the truth. Then what? You'll let me go, even if you don't get what you're really after?</string>
  <string id="6066277">I will let you go.</string>
  <string id="6066280">Well, now we're talking.</string>
  <string id="6066283">None of this is what I thought it would be.</string>
  <string id="6066312">Slaver</string>
  <string id="6066315">Delilah says you followed my expedition's route. Why?</string>
  <string id="6066316">Why are you here?</string>
  <string id="6066317">We should bring your sister the good news.</string>
  <string id="6066318">Delilah will be relieved.</string>
  <string id="6066320">Bait and Switch</string>
  <string id="6066322">You think you've won.</string>
  <string id="6066325">They will say I died defending my city, defending the innocent from evil.</string>
  <string id="6066328">You hear me, Champion? I have won! This is my victory! Laughs</string>
  <string id="6066331">Laughs</string>
  <string id="6066335">Well done! It seems you have proven me right after all.</string>
  <string id="6066338">You can never trust a mage. Especially those who turn on their own kind.</string>
  <string id="6066339">Bravo! It seems you have done my work for me.</string>
  <string id="6066342">All those years spent coddling these mages, and they die here at your hands. How fitting.</string>
  <string id="6066343">Come to add yourself to the pile, Meredith? I'm more than happy to oblige.</string>
  <string id="6066344">You're next.</string>
  <string id="6066345">Oh yes, another traitor to add to the list.</string>
  <string id="6066348">You pushed them to this with your petty hatred.</string>
  <string id="6066349">This is your fault.</string>
  <string id="6066350">There is nothing petty about my hatred of mages. It is justified, and righteous.</string>
  <string id="6066353">Looks like you were right. Abominations galore.</string>
  <string id="6066354">They were all blood mages!</string>
  <string id="6066355">And I see one more standing in front of me.</string>
  <string id="6066358">Too bad you perished battling their menace.</string>
  <string id="6066363">And... Anders?</string>
  <string id="6066366">Making friends as always, I see.</string>
  <string id="6066369">But you died! I saw the body... the arrow in the neck.</string>
  <string id="6066378">Perfect! If you come across any templars, or, ah, Grey Wardens who might want me back, tell them exactly that.</string>
  <string id="6066379">There's no escaping you, it seems.</string>
  <string id="6066382">I'm special that way.</string>
  <string id="6066385">That is one way to put it.</string>
  <string id="6066386">Anders, is there something you're not telling me? About being dead?</string>
  <string id="6066387">Anders died?</string>
  <string id="6066388">When Vigil's Keep fell to the darkspawn, I left. Unheroic, I know.</string>
  <string id="6066394">But your body—</string>
  <string id="6066397">Let me guess: badly burned? In robes? Do all mages look the same to you?</string>
  <string id="6066406">I can see this is an argument I will not win.</string>
  <string id="6066407">You went further into the Deep Roads than anyone believed possible.</string>
  <string id="6066410">As much as I enjoy the company, is there anything keeping us in these darkspawn-infested tunnels?</string>
  <string id="6066411">Maybe we should leave.</string>
  <string id="6066412">My mission was to find you. I've done that, so let's go.</string>
  <string id="6066413">Enough small talk. Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6066414">I don't remember drawing anyone a map to the thaig. Who told you about it?</string>
  <string id="6066415">Who told you about the thaig?</string>
  <string id="6066416">Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
You might be interested in something that's come up. A contact of mine, a fellow by the name of Anso, is asking around for someone competent regarding a job, and I suggested you. He's always paid well, so if I were you, I'd check into it before someone else snaps it up. He said he'll be in the Lowtown Bazaar at night.&#13;
&#13;
Athenril</string>
  <string id="6066417">Meet Anso in the Lowtown Bazaar at night.</string>
  <string id="6066419">Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
A dwarf named Anso contacted the Red Iron looking for contract work. Wish I could take him up on it, but we've pressing business, so I recommended you. The dwarf pays well, so don't be a fool and miss out. Look for Anso in the Lowtown Bazaar at night if you're interested.&#13;
&#13;
Meeran</string>
  <string id="6066420">Meet Anso in the Lowtown Bazaar at night.</string>
  <string id="6066424">The First Warden himself ordered this investigation.</string>
  <string id="6066426">Anso the Contact</string>
  <string id="6066428">I could say the same. Aren't you supposed to be dead?</string>
  <string id="6066431">That's the rumor. But I didn't come here to swap stories with you.</string>
  <string id="6066462">Walk on, guard dog, otherwise you'll get the stick, too.</string>
  <string id="6066474">Abandoned House</string>
  <string id="6066476">Well met, my young friend.</string>
  <string id="6066479">I've heard impressive stories about you and your friends. Are you perhaps interested in a simple job? </string>
  <string id="6066493">I was offered a generous share of the salvage, plus extra coin up front to discourage any... curiosity.</string>
  <string id="6066497">We have been sworn to secrecy. I cannot reveal more.</string>
  <string id="6066498">An unfortunate dwarf named Bartrand.</string>
  <string id="6066501">We feared you might return if you learned of our interest in the thaig.</string>
  <string id="6066515">Brilliant! I'm amazed that you found everything! My craft can begin anew! Your reward, my young friend!</string>
  <string id="6066518">Thank you, my friend! Only one thing on the list left to find!</string>
  <string id="6066529">Ah, my young friend. How goes the search?</string>
  <string id="6066534">Lowtown</string>
  <string id="6066553">Smuggler's Cargo</string>

  <string id="6066609">It looks like you met heavy resistance.</string>
  <string id="6066610">What happened here?</string>
  <string id="6066611">The Warden's allies assured us these tunnels would still be mostly clear.</string>
  <string id="6066617">But it seems they were wrong.</string>
  <string id="6066618">They seem to know a great deal about darkspawn. Are these allies dwarves?</string>
  <string id="6066619">Who are these allies?</string>
  <string id="6066624">I cannot leave now. When we were attacked, I was separated from the rest of my expedition. Some of them may yet live.</string>
  <string id="6066627">We must go deeper into the tunnels to rescue them.</string>

  <string id="6066708">Who are you looking for?</string>
  <string id="6066709">Some Wardens survived the initial ambush. I think the dwarf we brought from Vigil's Keep survived...</string>
  <string id="6066712">But who still lives? Only the Maker knows.</string>
  <string id="6066713">Before I help you, I'd like to know why the Wardens were here in the first place.</string>
  <string id="6066714">Answer more questions first.</string>
  <string id="6066715">I promised to keep some matters secret. I will not disgrace my family any further by oath-breaking.</string>

  <string id="6066721">We have survivors to find. Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6066722">Let's rescue your friends.</string>
  <string id="6066763">Search the bodies. I need to find out where Hayder is.</string>
  <string id="6066769">Hiding in the chantry and sending thugs to finish me off? Coward.</string>
  <string id="6066772">He'll not get away with this. Come on.</string>
  <string id="6066860">Tevinter Hunter</string>
  <string id="6066862">That's not the elf! Who is that?</string>
  <string id="6066865">It doesn't matter! We were told to kill whoever enters the house!</string>
  <string id="6066875">Isabela. Should've known you'd find me here.</string>
  <string id="6066878">Tell your men to burn the letters next time.</string>
  <string id="6066881">Castillon was heartbroken when he heard about the shipwreck. You should've let him know you survived.</string>
  <string id="6066884">It must have slipped my mind.</string>
  <string id="6066887">Chuckles Where's the relic?</string>
  <string id="6066896">I lost it. Castillon's just going to have to do without.</string>
  <string id="6066899">Lost it? Just like you lost a ship full of valuable cargo?</string>
  <string id="6066902">They weren't cargo, Hayder, they were people!</string>
  <string id="6066908">And now the relic's gone, too. Castillon won't be happy to hear that, I promise you.</string>
  <string id="6066909">You don't have to tell Castillon about Isabela.</string>
  <string id="6066910">We can work this out.</string>
  <string id="6066911">Your threats end here.</string>

  <string id="6067065">Castillon won't hear about me from Hayder, but he'll find me eventually.</string>
  <string id="6067068">I just have to get him the relic. It's simple as that.</string>
  <string id="6067069">Who is Castillon?</string>
  <string id="6067070">Castillon?</string>
  <string id="6067071">I used to work for him. The jobs mostly involved smuggling lyrium, jewels, or the occasional criminal acquaintance.</string>
  <string id="6067077">What's this about you freeing slaves?</string>
  <string id="6067078">Hayder mentioned human cargo.</string>
  <string id="6067085">Boarded the ship to find slaves. Nearly two hundred—elves, humans... children even. It was sickening. </string>
  <string id="6067098">What's so interesting about the relic?</string>
  <string id="6067099">Why the relic?</string>
  <string id="6067100">Castillon has me chasing it down as payback for freeing his slaves.</string>
  <string id="6067106">I don't really know what it is, except that it's ancient and worth my weight in gold.</string>
  <string id="6067110">Did you end up in Kirkwall because your ship was destroyed?</string>
  <string id="6067111">You were shipwrecked?</string>
  <string id="6067112">There was a storm. The ship ran aground on the reefs near the city.</string>
  <string id="6067115">Poor sods. I knew some of those men almost ten years.</string>
  <string id="6067118">Ah... balls.</string>
  <string id="6067119">If getting the relic gets Castillon off your back, then I'll help you retrieve it.</string>
  <string id="6067120">I can help you.</string>
  <string id="6067121">I still don't know where it is, but you'll be the first to know if I hear anything.</string>
  <string id="6067122">You stood up to Castillon before, you can do it again. Don't give him what he wants.</string>
  <string id="6067123">Forget Castillon.</string>
  <string id="6067124">I stood up to him once... look where that got me.</string>
  <string id="6067130">Anyway, thanks for helping me out with Hayder.</string>
  <string id="6067137">If I cross him, he'll have me killed. And my life is worth more than hers.</string>
  <string id="6067140">Go to the magister's mansion in Hightown at night to meet with Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6067141">Anso's job was actually the machinations of an escaped Tevinter slave named Fenris who wanted to kill the magister hunting him. As his offer was refused, he left to follow his own path.</string>
  <string id="6067187">The magister is staying at a mansion in Hightown. Meet me there as soon as you can. We must enter before morning.</string>
  <string id="6067195">You did. Here, then, is your payment. You did as you were asked.</string>

  <string id="6067232">After the magister fled, Fenris took residence in his Hightown mansion and can be found there in the future.</string>
  <string id="6067269">We should move. Stay alert for darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6067282">Too many darkspawn to count. It happened so quickly.</string>
  <string id="6067285">They're close now. I can sense them.</string>
  <string id="6067291">You say that like it's a good thing.</string>
  <string id="6067294">Where's your sense of adventure?</string>
  <string id="6067297">I was hoping Justice would have been the dominant personality.</string>
  <string id="6067300">Oh, you're no fun.</string>
  <string id="6067303">These bodies are fresh. Hopefully there are survivors up ahead.</string>
  <string id="6067306">Things went easily at first, but here is where they came for us.</string>
  <string id="6067311">Us ranging into the depths, fighting darkspawn and the Children. It's like old times.</string>
  <string id="6067314">Give me the signal, and I'll blow the barrels.</string>

  <string id="6067340">Well met are strangers in the belly of the earth.</string>
  <string id="6067343">Hope you don't mind, Warden, but I set up the explosives here and there.</string>
  <string id="6067346">I hope Ser Fenley won't mind, but I set up the explosives here and there.</string>
  <string id="6067349">Figured I'd blow up as many of the 'spawn as I could before I embraced the stone.</string>

  <string id="6067367">How did you manage to get Qunari explosives?</string>
  <string id="6067368">Where did you get explosives?</string>
  <string id="6067369">These aren't Qunari explosives. They're dwarven made. And don't you forget it.</string>
  <string id="6067372">Temmerin's cousin Dworkin made the explosives back in Vigil's Keep.</string>
  <string id="6067375">Aye, and that he did... before the sodding Qunari forced him into hiding.</string>
  <string id="6067376">What were you doing with these explosives?</string>
  <string id="6067377">What are you going to blow up?</string>
  <string id="6067378">We were prepared to do extensive excavations around the thaig you found.</string>
  <string id="6067384">A few well placed booms prove most efficacious at clearing rubble.</string>
  <string id="6067385">These explosives could kill a great many darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6067386">This could help us out.</string>
  <string id="6067387">Let's teach these darkspawn a lesson.</string>
  <string id="6067388">Time to kill some darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6067389">Temmerin, the way behind us is clear.</string>
  <string id="6067392">Send word to the Wardens in case we don't make it.</string>
  <string id="6067395">Aye. I've set explosives all along the tunnels.</string>
  <string id="6067398">Blow up as many of the sodding 'spawn as you can. Luck to you both.</string>

  <string id="6067627">Why do you bother me, human? I hire no blades and need no goods.</string>
  <string id="6067630">Why do you bother me, human? The dwarf paid you. There is no more.</string>
  <string id="6067633">Your kind think selfishness and want are normal. This city, all of it, leaves a bad taste.</string>
  <string id="6067634">Seems to me that most of Kirkwall hates you just as much.</string>
  <string id="6067635">Qunari are hated too.</string>
  <string id="6067636">If you despise this place, why haven't you left?</string>
  <string id="6067637">Then why stay?</string>
  <string id="6067638">You don't want to talk, we won't talk.</string>
  <string id="6067639">Fine, I'll leave.</string>
  <string id="6067640">Hold.</string>
  <string id="6067646">Since we arrived I have seen nothing but greed and weakness. Dwarves, humans, elves—just... festering. No order, no goal.</string>
  <string id="6067649">You are one of the few I have met with any ability. And yet this too was random, a result of selfishness.</string>
  <string id="6067652">I cannot fathom how a mire like this can be justified.</string>
  <string id="6067655">We are hated? How do you not hate yourselves and this... chaos?</string>
  <string id="6067656">You say we should leave, but how can you bear to stay in this... chaos?</string>
  <string id="6067657">You turned from me. Do you turn as easily from all this... chaos?</string>
  <string id="6067658">My welcome to the city was not so different from yours.</string>
  <string id="6067659">I hope to make it better.</string>
  <string id="6067660">And yet you suffer it.</string>
  <string id="6067663">It's an opportunity to make a real difference.</string>
  <string id="6067666">I take no blame for this city. I'm new here too.</string>
  <string id="6067667">I don't like it either.</string>
  <string id="6067668">And it disgusts you as well?</string>
  <string id="6067671">Some of it, but would it be so different anywhere else?</string>
  <string id="6067674">Why would anyone want to change it?</string>
  <string id="6067675">It's life, glorious and wild.</string>
  <string id="6067676">You... like it?</string>
  <string id="6067679">It's a city of people living their lives, for good or ill.</string>
  <string id="6067682">I agree it's a mess.</string>
  <string id="6067683">Weakness provides opportunity.</string>
  <string id="6067684">But you don't see that as a problem?</string>
  <string id="6067687">I see it as an opportunity, and I intend to take full advantage.</string>
  <string id="6067693">Karasten are soldiers. The Qun made it so. They can never vary from that assigned path, never be other than they are meant to be.</string>
  <string id="6067696">But, they are free to choose within that role. To accept and succeed, or deny and die. Glory is clear and defined.</string>
  <string id="6067699">Could you—could not this entire city—benefit from that certainty? How else will you know when you have made a real difference?</string>
  <string id="6067700">You claim it is no different anywhere else. We deny that with a certainty that would benefit not just you, but this whole city.</string>
  <string id="6067701">You allow chaos for good or ill, but one is clearly superior. Can you see how that certainty would benefit this whole city?</string>
  <string id="6067702">It is an undeniable certainty. What full advantage can you take without that authority?</string>
  <string id="6067703">Sorry, I find myself distracted by deny and die.</string>
  <string id="6067704">Is that a threat?</string>
  <string id="6067705">And yet you accept the random violence that plagues this nation.</string>
  <string id="6067708">I wonder if the weaker of your citizens would be so closed to certainty?</string>
  <string id="6067711">Our role may have to change. If the Qun demands.</string>
  <string id="6067714">He's free to choose to obey? That isn't contradictory to you?</string>
  <string id="6067715">Is it certainty or slavery?</string>
  <string id="6067716">He chooses to be. As do we all, long before any of your meaningless freedoms are presented.</string>
  <string id="6067719">I am not the one to educate you. I did not intend to land here.</string>
  <string id="6067722">But this city may demand certainty. </string>
  <string id="6067725">Have you come here to proselytize? To convert?</string>
  <string id="6067726">Did you come to convert us?</string>
  <string id="6067727">No. Foundering here was unexpected. I have purpose other than watching you rot.</string>
  <string id="6067730">But... this city. How long must I let you harm yourselves?</string>
  <string id="6067733">I suspect the day is coming soon. We are done, human.</string>
  <string id="6067734">I suspect we are done, human.</string>
  <string id="6067735">You guard your powder carefully.</string>
  <string id="6067736">Why not sell the gaatlok?</string>
  <string id="6067737">It is a tool that can only be allowed to exist under the ordered authority of the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6067740">It could benefit many people.</string>
  <string id="6067743">It does now. Just as swords benefit warriors, but are not given to children.</string>
  <string id="6067746">Well, your children.</string>
  <string id="6067747">How many Qunari have you lost to the Tal-Vashoth?</string>
  <string id="6067748">Tell me of the Tal-Vashoth.</string>
  <string id="6067749">None.</string>
  <string id="6067752">You can't believe that.</string>
  <string id="6067755">That seems unlikely.</string>
  <string id="6067758">Optimistic, considering my death toll.</string>
  <string id="6067761">We lose nothing when weakness abandons the Qun. It is the Tal-Vashoth who have lost themselves.</string>
  <string id="6067762">I met an honorable one.</string>
  <string id="6067763">One of them warned me.</string>
  <string id="6067764">Doubtful.</string>
  <string id="6067767">He said he was a mercenary, not a murderer.</string>
  <string id="6067770">Then I know he made no claim to honor. When they sell themselves, little remains.</string>
  <string id="6067773">He is not even dead to the Qun—he is a living insult.</string>
  <string id="6067774">You're a long way from home. Why did you come?</string>
  <string id="6067775">What was your mission?</string>
  <string id="6067776">To meet a demand of the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6067779">Which was...?</string>
  <string id="6067788">It is a matter only the Qunari understand. We remain until we fulfill the demand of the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6067797">Or until the demand changes.</string>
  <string id="6067798">I don't think Kirkwall would do well under military rule.</string>
  <string id="6067799">You'd impose help on the city?</string>
  <string id="6067800">The rule of the Qun is not military. It is discipline and order.</string>
  <string id="6067803">How is that different?</string>
  <string id="6067806">To your limited understanding, it is not. You fear soldiers that arrive to remove your pitiable vices.</string>
  <string id="6067809">But they do not control Qunari. The triumvirate divides and governs. One is nothing without the others.</string>
  <string id="6067810">Can you tell me about the other two parts?</string>
  <string id="6067811">The triumvirate?</string>
  <string id="6067812">No.</string>
  <string id="6067815">Of course you can't.</string>
  <string id="6067818">Then we can learn nothing.</string>
  <string id="6067821">Now you're just being difficult.</string>
  <string id="6067824">I am no more equipped to explain than you are to understand.</string>
  <string id="6067827">Arishok, Arigena, Ariqun. Pillars of the Qunari, of the nation that must be.</string>
  <string id="6067830">There is but one way to know these things, human. And I have yet to decide if it must be done.</string>
  <string id="6067832">I've had confrontations with others in your command.</string>
  <string id="6067833">I killed some of your Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6067834">There have been a number of incidents, but you must mean Arvaarad, found dead after tracking Saarebas.</string>
  <string id="6067837">I thought nothing could threaten Arvaarad.</string>
  <string id="6067840">You are not angry?</string>
  <string id="6067843">A mage is dead. That is what matters. The rest is... impressive.</string>
  <string id="6067846">So you said. I remain impressed.</string>
  <string id="6067849">But do not repeat it.</string>
  <string id="6067850">I believe a member of the Chantry intended it to happen.</string>
  <string id="6067851">It was a set-up by a sister.</string>
  <string id="6067852">Friend and enemy blend together in this sea of filth. I can barely discern one group from another.</string>
  <string id="6067855">But as this clearly means something to you, I acknowledge the risk taken.</string>
  <string id="6067856">Saarebas chose death over leaving the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6067857">The mage refused freedom.</string>
  <string id="6067858">That is good to hear.</string>
  <string id="6067861">That is all you have to say?</string>
  <string id="6067864">I will not insult Saarebas with the suggestion that making the right choice was difficult. I expect as much from every Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6067867">I doubt Saarebas earned a greater honor in his life than my reaction now.</string>
  <string id="6067868">Farewell.</string>
  <string id="6067869">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="6067870">Panahedan, human.</string>
  <string id="6067874">We have little to discuss, human. For now. I would think on the fate of this city.</string>
  <string id="6067878">Search the mansion to find Magister Danarius.</string>
  <string id="6067897">Clan Craftmaster</string>

  <string id="6067903">Danarius!</string>
  <string id="6067904">Come and face me!</string>
  <string id="6067928">Most of Kirkwall hates you as much as you hate being here.</string>
  <string id="6067929">Seems you're just as despised.</string>
  <string id="6067930">If you dislike Kirkwall so much, why haven't you left?</string>
  <string id="6067931">If you hate it here, leave.</string>
  <string id="6067932">If you won't talk straight, then we won't talk.</string>
  <string id="6067933">Save the lecture.</string>
  <string id="6067942">Magister Danarius has escaped. Look around before you leave.</string>
  <string id="6067979">Bethany?</string>
  <string id="6067982">Is that really you?</string>
  <string id="6067985">Are you here to save me again?</string>
  <string id="6067988">You know each other?</string>
  <string id="6067991">She is my sister.</string>
  <string id="6067992">He is my brother.</string>
  <string id="6067993">You don't look well, Bethany. Are you injured?</string>
  <string id="6067994">Are you all right?</string>
  <string id="6067995">Injured? I have the darkspawn taint forever in my veins, barely held in check by the Wardens' rituals.</string>
  <string id="6067998">I will never be well again.</string>
  <string id="6068001">Where there's life, there's hope.</string>
  <string id="6068004">A little smile for me, Sister? It's been years. I've missed you.</string>
  <string id="6068005">Cheer up, Sis.</string>
  <string id="6068006">I have kept track of your doings. I'm glad you've done well for yourself, though perhaps too late for Mother.</string>
  <string id="6068009">But I am a Warden now. We have no families.</string>
  <string id="6068012">They say it's always darkest before the dawn.</string>
  <string id="6068015">You're not dead yet. Shake it off! There's work to be done.</string>
  <string id="6068016">Pull yourself together.</string>
  <string id="6068017">You sound just like Ser Fenley—before the Children devoured him.</string>
  <string id="6068023">Enough, Bethany. We need your help here or we'll all die.</string>
  <string id="6068026">Carver?</string>
  <string id="6068029">What are you doing here?</string>
  <string id="6068035">You know each other?</string>
  <string id="6068038">She is my sister.</string>
  <string id="6068039">He is my brother.</string>
  <string id="6068067">We don't have time for this. The darkspawn approach.</string>
  <string id="6068094">And how did you do that?</string>
  <string id="6068097">Not enchantment!</string>
  <string id="6068103">You waste time. The dwarf and his theft has caused a very real threat to your city.</string>
  <string id="6068104">If I didn't know better, I'd say you developed a case of hero worship.</string>
  <string id="6068154">Viscount's Keep</string>
  <string id="6068159">Hold, shemlen! Your kind are not welcome among the Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6068219">Champion,&#13;
&#13;
You have proven yourself a friend of order in this city, and I find myself in need of your support once again. Dire events are underway at the Gallows which could tear the city apart. I believe the Champion's appearance could make all the difference, and thus I ask you to come as soon as possible.&#13;
&#13;
Knight-Commander Meredith</string>
  <string id="6068220">Go to the Gallows as soon as possible. According to Knight-Commander Meredith, something dire requires the Champion's assistance. Considering her warning, it might be prudent to finish up any urgent business in the city first.</string>
  <string id="6068222">Go to the Gallows as soon as possible. According to First Enchanter Orsino, something dire requires the Champion's assistance. Considering his warning, it might be prudent to finish up any urgent business in the city first.</string>
  <string id="6068224">Champion,&#13;
&#13;
You have proven yourself a friend to Kirkwall's mages and it seems I must call upon you once again. Meredith has gone too far, and I will not let her madness remain unchecked. I ask that you come to the Gallows at once. Perhaps together we can stop this before there is bloodshed.&#13;
&#13;
First Enchanter Orsino</string>
  <string id="6068261">I fear we have come all this way for nothing.</string>
  <string id="6068264">But my fallen comrades will be avenged. The darkspawn are here.</string>
  <string id="6068267">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6068268">I was given an amulet for someone named Marethari.</string>
  <string id="6068269">I don't want trouble.</string>
  <string id="6068270">How do you know that name?</string>
  <string id="6068291">The sooner I finish my business, the sooner I'll leave.</string>
  <string id="6068292">Let me pass.</string>
  <string id="6068293">I'm not expecting tea and cakes. I just need to see someone.</string>
  <string id="6068294">I get that a lot.</string>
  <string id="6068297">What's a shemlen?</string>
  <string id="6068298">What did you call me?</string>
  <string id="6068308">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6068310">It is the elven word for human.</string>
  <string id="6068311">It means you're not one of the People, and you should leave. Now.</string>
  <string id="6068335">Who are you people?</string>
  <string id="6068336">What are the Dalish?</string>
  <string id="6068341">For the first time since I've been down here, I don't sense a single darkspawn. We've won.</string>
  <string id="6068344">Won? Our losses are too great to claim that. Can we leave, Nathaniel?</string>
  <string id="6068347">I am eager to leave, Nathaniel.</string>
  <string id="6068350">The route to the surface should be safe now.</string>
  <string id="6068353">Because of you, I will see my sister and nephew again. Please, take this with my blessing.</string>
  <string id="6068356">Goodbye, Bethany.</string>
  <string id="6068359">Goodbye, Brother.</string>
  <string id="6068362">Goodbye, Carver.</string>
  <string id="6068368">Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6068369">Stay safe, my friend.</string>
  <string id="6068372">It was good to see you again.</string>
  <string id="6068373">Stay safe, Nathaniel.</string>
  <string id="6068376">You as well.</string>
  <string id="6068422">We are the last of the elvhen.</string>
  <string id="6068426">Serah Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6068432">Well?</string>
  <string id="6068435">Messere?</string>
  <string id="6068438">Yes?</string>
  <string id="6068441">Last we met, I did not know your name. Did not care to.</string>
  <string id="6068444">You have changed your fortune over the years. The Qunari have not.</string>
  <string id="6068447">I offer a courtesy, Hawke. Someone has stolen what he thinks is the formula for gaatlok.</string>
  <string id="6068450">You will want to hunt him.</string>
  <string id="6068451">Sounds like the recovery should be worth something to me.</string>
  <string id="6068452">You're hiring me?</string>
  <string id="6068453">A thousand lives.</string>
  <string id="6068456">Excuse me, but this sounds like quite the feat.</string>
  <string id="6068457">Someone stole your explosives?</string>
  <string id="6068458">It was allowed.</string>
  <string id="6068464">I got next to nothing from our last deal. Solve your own problem.</string>
  <string id="6068465">Why should I care?</string>
  <string id="6068466">I got nothing from my last attempt to deal with you. Solve your own problem.</string>
  <string id="6068467">Why should I care?</string>
  <string id="6068468">Thousands will die.</string>
  <string id="6068474">The stolen formula was a decoy. Saar-qamek—a poison gas, not explosives.</string>
  <string id="6068477">A small amount is dangerous enough to your kind. But if made in quantity, perhaps by someone intending to sell it...</string>
  <string id="6068480">That merchant... Javaris?</string>
  <string id="6068483">Would he be cautious, or would he assume success and make enough to threaten a district?</string>
  <string id="6068486">A courtesy, Hawke. You will want to hunt him.</string>
  <string id="6068487">It took Javaris long enough to come up with this. Are you sure it was him?</string>
  <string id="6068488">Did anyone see the theft?</string>
  <string id="6068489">Others have asked for the gaatlok, but only he chose to delude himself beyond no.</string>
  <string id="6068492">Is three years so long to a hateful fool? I have no way of understanding such weakness.</string>
  <string id="6068495">His crime seems obvious. Further evidence could be the deaths of many. I wouldn't wait.</string>
  <string id="6068496">So, how dangerous does this fake mixture become?</string>
  <string id="6068497">What is the effect of the gas?</string>
  <string id="6068498">It is not a threat to Qunari. For your kind, it is as dangerous as those who breathe it.</string>
  <string id="6068501">Explain.</string>
  <string id="6068504">Can you elaborate?</string>
  <string id="6068507">No riddles, please.</string>
  <string id="6068510">The gas kills, but first it turns allies against their own in blind rage.</string>
  <string id="6068513">So, the greater the skill of those sent against us, the more dangerous they become to their own people.</string>
  <string id="6068516">Turning thieves into monsters.</string>
  <string id="6068519">Hard to control at the best of times.</string>
  <string id="6068522">And you thought this was a good idea?</string>
  <string id="6068525">It is no longer our problem.</string>
  <string id="6068526">So, you just leave the decoy laying around?</string>
  <string id="6068527">You let him steal it?</string>
  <string id="6068531">If the real formula were at risk, the Qun would demand that we protect it to the last of us.</string>
  <string id="6068539">I barely spoke to you three years ago. Why give me this warning?</string>
  <string id="6068540">Why send for me?</string>
  <string id="6068541">You are capable, but I have yet to decide if you are capable of understanding.</string>
  <string id="6068544">Save your streets from this fool dwarf. Then we will talk.</string>
  <string id="6068545">You made your hate for this city clear three years ago. Why give me this warning?</string>
  <string id="6068546">Why send for me?</string>
  <string id="6068547">I don't call anyone in Kirkwall an ally, or even a good rival. But you have shown competence.</string>
  <string id="6068550">The day comes when the Qun will demand an accounting. Until then, I will show respect to the most promising among you.</string>
  <string id="6068555">Any idea where we can find Javaris?</string>
  <string id="6068556">Varric! Where would he be?</string>
  <string id="6068557">I heard about a sell-off. Merchant territories and such. They don't do that unless someone left in a hurry.</string>
  <string id="6068560">I'd have figured he rooked some noble. He's sure not a burglar.</string>
  <string id="6068563">Just tell me where he is.</string>
  <string id="6068566">I haven't kept up on the squirt. Ask the Coterie.</string>
  <string id="6068569">I appreciate you bringing this to me.</string>
  <string id="6068570">Thank you for the warning.</string>
  <string id="6068571">I have long thought this city would destroy itself. This would only hasten the inevitable.</string>
  <string id="6068574">I'll have his head by morning.</string>
  <string id="6068575">Consider him dead.</string>
  <string id="6068576">His death is inevitable. You will determine how many join him.</string>
  <string id="6068579">Can't say I appreciate being saddled with this mess.</string>
  <string id="6068580">I don't like this, Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6068581">Your thief set this in motion, not us. I was tempted to let it come to its expected end.</string>
  <string id="6068587">Panahedan, Hawke. I do not hope you die.</string>
  <string id="6068590">Panahedan, Hawke. It will be interesting to see if you die.</string>
  <string id="6068661">Kerod's Accounts</string>
  <string id="6068663">Geoff Kerod's records contain pages of scrawled notes. One catches your eye.&#13;
&#13;
- Gamlen's niece—potential buyer?&#13;
- Marcia Arthurius—sold. Butcher's street, Lowtown.&#13;
- Templars? Viscount?</string>

  <string id="6068668">The details have changed, but the danger remains. Resolve it before you bring this to me again.</string>
  <string id="6068673">You have no business here.</string>
  <string id="6068674">There's nothing here for any human.</string>

  <string id="6068679">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6068683">Dalish Hunter</string>
  <string id="6068690">Told you all I know about our friend Javaris. Smugglers' Cut, outside town.</string>
  <string id="6068694">Turn up your purses, Kirkwall. The leases of Javaris Tintop are up for grabs!</string>
  <string id="6068695">The shelves and stores of one Javaris Tintop. Clear title for auction.</string>
  <string id="6068696">The Tintop inventory awaits, friends. Javaris knew his quality.</string>
  <string id="6068697">You're selling the assets of Javaris Tintop?</string>
  <string id="6068730">Wait! This is the one the Keeper spoke of.</string>
  <string id="6068733">A shemlen? I thought he'd be an elf.</string>
  <string id="6068736">A shemlen? I thought she'd be an elf.</string>
  <string id="6068739">Enter the camp. Keeper Marethari has been waiting for you.</string>
  <string id="6068743">The sooner you all leave this place, the better.</string>
  <string id="6068744">Conclude your business with Keeper Marethari, shemlen, and be gone from here.</string>
  <string id="6068747">Cause trouble, and you'll meet our blades, stranger.</string>
  <string id="6068752">The Blooming Rose</string>
  <string id="6068784">Will someone explain what's going on?</string>
  <string id="6068785">What are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="6068789">I said I arranged for a duel, which I did. I also said you wouldn't play fair, which you didn't.</string>
  <string id="6068792">We can talk later if you want. Right now we have other problems.</string>
  <string id="6068793">Andaran atish'an, travelers. Indeed, I am Keeper Marethari. Let me look at you. </string>
  <string id="6068800">Isabela's been a very bad girl. Ruined a perfect business deal, and then ran away.</string>
  <string id="6068808">It has been a long, hard journey to this place. And it's far from over.</string>
  <string id="6068811">Viscount's Keep</string>
  <string id="6068815">Chantry</string>
  <string id="6068817">There's truth in your face. A rare thing in a human.</string>
  <string id="6068818">There is a light in your heart, human. Don't let it go out. You will need it.</string>

  <string id="6068831">The Blooming Rose</string>
  <string id="6068833">There's only one way to settle this.</string>
  <string id="6068840">We are. Limited districts, limited contracts. Keeps territory clear and separate from the start.</string>
  <string id="6068843">He had a meager lot, but he's skipped with dues outstanding, so up it goes.</string>
  <string id="6068844">There's a lot riding on finding Javaris. Can you help?</string>
  <string id="6068845">It's important I find him.</string>
  <string id="6068846">The members of our little fellowship expect privacy. But, he skipped out on paying me, too.</string>
  <string id="6068847">Sounds like he's made a few friends. Can one of them point me his way?</string>
  <string id="6068848">Where is this popular fellow?</string>
  <string id="6068853">Javaris left in a hurry. I'd put him at Smugglers' Cut, if he's avoiding patrols. It empties at a cave outside town.</string>
  <string id="6068857">Marethari? I was told to bring you this amulet.</string>
  <string id="6068860">I need to find Javaris now. Where's he hiding?</string>
  <string id="6068861">Tell me where he is.</string>
  <string id="6068864">Tell him I said, Don't come back.</string>
  <string id="6068866">Ask that about anyone else, I'd have you thrown out. This one, he owes me, too.</string>
  <string id="6068869">Scary. Anyone else, I'd jump to their defense. Unless they owed me like he does.</string>
  <string id="6068874">Javaris doesn't exactly sound like a mastermind at work, here.</string>
  <string id="6068875">There's no way this Javaris stole from the Qunari. That's hard. I've heard.</string>
  <string id="6068876">Not the trail I'd expect from a master thief. Just saying.</string>
  <string id="6068877">This is not the trail of a master criminal.</string>
  <string id="6068878">Javaris does not sound capable of the crime we are chasing.</string>
  <string id="6068879">Javaris hardly sounds capable of pulling this off.</string>
  <string id="6068880">Not the most cunning of burglars.</string>
  <string id="6068883">Templar</string>
  <string id="6068887">Mage</string>
  <string id="6068898">Tell me how this burden fell to you, child.</string>
  <string id="6068899">Your guards said you spoke of me. How did you know I was coming?</string>
  <string id="6068900">Were you expecting me?</string>
  <string id="6068906">Followed! We're followed! Fight!</string>
  <string id="6068907">I knew they'd come for me! Knew it! Get them!</string>
  <string id="6068908">Stop them! Someone has to stop them!</string>
  <string id="6068911">He's a powerful merchant based in Antiva. I believe he has ties to the Felicisima Armada.</string>
  <string id="6068914">He paid well.</string>

  <string id="6068921">There are no more survivors. Defeat the darkspawn and escape.</string>

  <string id="6068965">They paid Castillon to take them away from the Blight. He took their money and sold them into slavery.</string>
  <string id="6068983">Champion! Thank the Maker you've come!</string>
  <string id="6068986">Even I can see that's wrong.</string>
  <string id="6068987">Those slaves were worth a hundred sovereigns a head, and you let them scurry off into the wilds.</string>
  <string id="6069022">Sighs To be honest, I think he just wants me dead. But that would be letting me off easy.</string>
  <string id="6069023">I managed to make it to shore. Most of my men weren't as lucky.</string>
  <string id="6069026">The compound was not meant to be permanent. There are concerns the Qunari influence is... no longer contained.</string>

  <string id="6069052">The viscount's son is a rampant scamp. I'd not be surprised if he incited the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6069054">Did ya hear bout the viscount's brat? Got himself snatched by Qunari, he did.</string>
  <string id="6069055">I'd rescue the viscount's boy, but the Winters are after him. They'd sooner split your skull than a reward.</string>
  <string id="6069056">Qunari are monsters, I keep saying! Maybe now that they've nabbed his boy, the viscount'll do something about them.</string>

  <string id="6069439">Why would anyone besides the Qunari want this relic?</string>
  <string id="6069440">Who values the relic?</string>
  <string id="6069441">The Tevinter Imperium have been at war with the Qunari for centuries.</string>
  <string id="6069442">I thought you and the Qunari were caught in a storm.</string>
  <string id="6069443">What about the shipwreck?</string>
  <string id="6069444">They completely splintered my ship.</string>
  <string id="6069451">Sam used to run with Martin. Remember him?</string>
  <string id="6069452">Sam used to run with Martin, an old friend of mine.</string>

  <string id="6069471">Deep Roads</string>

  <string id="6069473">Quest Accetped</string>
  <string id="6069474">Quest Accepted</string>
  <string id="6069477">And the Evets Marauders escape. Again. We sent for reinforcements. Andraste knows we've tried.</string>
  <string id="6069565">Keep your bloody head down.</string>
  <string id="6069571">Damn it all. You, take cover.</string>
  <string id="6069574">Aww, looks like you lost another one, guard dog. Bad day, right?</string>
  <string id="6069578">Who are you up against? Numbers?</string>
  <string id="6069579">What's the situation?</string>
  <string id="6069580">What are you talking about? You think we're guards?</string>
  <string id="6069581">Reinforcements?</string>
  <string id="6069582">Lieutenant Harley?</string>
  <string id="6069585">Aveline? Thank the Maker.</string>
  <string id="6069590">I happened to be in the area. Seeing the sights, killing bandits. The usual.</string>
  <string id="6069591">I was just taking a stroll.</string>
  <string id="6069605">Exactly what have I been carrying around? Is it magic?</string>
  <string id="6069606">What does the amulet do?</string>
  <string id="6069607">I brought the amulet here as I was asked. Aren't you supposed to tell me what to do with it?</string>
  <string id="6069608">It doesn't matter.</string>
  <string id="6069609">This amulet's owner rescued my family from the Blight. In return, I agreed to bring it to you.</string>
  <string id="6069610">The witch saved my life.</string>
  <string id="6069611">A dragon fell from the sky, charred some darkspawn, then asked me to bring you this amulet. No big deal.</string>
  <string id="6069612">It's a dull tale.</string>
  <string id="6069615">Hayder</string>
  <string id="6069621">A Murder of Crows</string>
  <string id="6069624">Are you the leader of these Dalish? Why did the witch tell me to bring this amulet to you?</string>
  <string id="6069625">Why bring the amulet here?</string>
  <string id="6069628">Storm? Chuckles The only storm was the one created by their infernal weapons.</string>
  <string id="6069631">The artifact belongs to the Qunari, and you'll let them leave with it.</string>
  <string id="6069632">Return it to the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6069634">It's yours. Your life depends on it.</string>
  <string id="6069635">We'll get the relic for you.</string>
  <string id="6069640">Bollocks! Little Bedden must not have made it back.</string>
  <string id="6069643">Not the best time for jest. Bollocks.</string>
  <string id="6069646">We're up against Evets Marauders.</string>
  <string id="6069649">Fell Orden's up there. And Viktor Longdeath's handiwork you've already seen.</string>
  <string id="6069652">We tried two sorties up the path, but it's trapped to oblivion.</string>
  <string id="6069655">Now I'd be thankful just to get out of here alive.</string>
  <string id="6069658">No fair, guard dog. You've brought friends.</string>
  <string id="6069661">Shut your mouth!</string>
  <string id="6069664">Laughs</string>
  <string id="6069665">Fell Orden? Viktor Longdeath? What are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="6069666">Who are we dealing with?</string>
  <string id="6069670">They've been robbing and raping for Maker knows how long. </string>
  <string id="6069673">Fell Orden, a blood mage, is here. Viktor Longdeath. Sophie.</string>
  <string id="6069676">We have to end them.</string>
  <string id="6069677">Isn't it suicide to stay pinned down here?</string>
  <string id="6069678">Why don't you run?</string>
  <string id="6069679">We're pinned down right now, but so are they.</string>
  <string id="6069682">If we run, Evets Marauders escape. Again.</string>
  <string id="6069685">So we've been waiting for reinforcements. Viktor's arrows and Orden's fireballs taking their toll, but we can still take them down.</string>
  <string id="6069686">What do you know about Evets Marauders, Isabela?</string>
  <string id="6069687">You know them, Isabela?</string>
  <string id="6069688">You haven't heard of them? When raiders want to scare other raiders, they say they're friends with Evets Marauders.</string>
  <string id="6069694">We're seven kinds of screwed. And not in a good way.</string>
  <string id="6069697">The longer we wait, the more of us they'll kill. Let's attack now.</string>
  <string id="6069698">Let's attack them together.</string>
  <string id="6069705">I listened. To the wind. To the birds, as the hunters do. To my dreams. I watched the stars.</string>
  <string id="6069706">It is a promise, child. Made by one whose word still has weight. And therefore it has terrible power.</string>
  <string id="6069707">I am the Keeper of this clan. It is my task to guide my people and to ensure the old ways are not forgotten.</string>
  <string id="6069708">Hayder's Letter</string>
  <string id="6069716">I'm with you. But my men may be too rattled to join us.</string>
  <string id="6069722">It's too dangerous for you and your men. Stay put, I'll take care of it.</string>
  <string id="6069723">Stay here. I'll do this alone.</string>
  <string id="6069724">Look out for traps. Be careful, Evets Marauders are deadly.</string>
  <string id="6069729">I understand. It is never an easy thing to speak of debts. I will ask no more questions of you.</string>
  <string id="6069730">I honor you for coming to me, but I'm afraid your part in this is not done yet.</string>
  <string id="6069731">You are blessed by luck, then. I will pray that Mythal watches over your path.</string>
  <string id="6069743">Meredith at my throat, Orsino at my heels, and a city scared of heretical giants.</string>
  <string id="6069752">I got his attention a couple times. I guess I impressed him, but that was years ago.</string>
  <string id="6069753">Small things, brief but honest.</string>
  <string id="6069755">Apparently not.</string>
  <string id="6069771">Go to the chantry to deal with Hayder.</string>
  <string id="6069772">Search the bodies for a clue to Hayder's whereabouts.</string>
  <string id="6069792">It makes no sense. And it doesn't matter. I just need them quiet.</string>
  <string id="6069794">Did a broad daylight assault on the Keep to rescue one of their number two years back.</string>
  <string id="6069797">Deep Roads</string>
  <string id="6069798">Deep Roads</string>
  <string id="6069803">There are few things in this world stronger than a promise kept. Remember that.</string>
  <string id="6069806">As for Asha'bellanar, I am tied to her, just as you are, by a debt that must be repaid.</string>
  <string id="6069807">There is great wisdom to be found all around us, if you know how to listen for it.</string>
  <string id="6069810">But I was not certain. Nothing is certain.</string>
  <string id="6069811">Just take the amulet.</string>
  <string id="6069812">What do I do now?</string>
  <string id="6069813">No kidding.</string>
  <string id="6069814">Just take the amulet.</string>
  <string id="6069815">That's why I'm here.</string>
  <string id="6069818">Balance has held because the Qunari ask for nothing. Even the space in Lowtown was a gift to contain them.</string>
  <string id="6069823">Just take the amulet.</string>
  <string id="6069824">I always repay dragons.</string>
  <string id="6069831">The amulet must be taken to an altar at the top of the mountain, and given a Dalish rite for the departed.</string>
  <string id="6069834">Then return the amulet to me. Do this, and your debt will be repaid.</string>
  <string id="6069837">But now the Arishok has requested you. By name.</string>
  <string id="6069848">Come on. We've no time to waste.</string>
  <string id="6069858">I will send my First with you. She will see to it the ritual is done.</string>
  <string id="6069861">And when it is complete, I must ask that you take her with you when you go.</string>
  <string id="6069862">Who is your First? First of what?</string>
  <string id="6069863">Who are you sending?</string>
  <string id="6069864">Your people would call her my apprentice or heir. Merrill would have taken my place as Keeper.</string>
  <string id="6069867">I live in Kirkwall. I don't have room for stray elves.</string>
  <string id="6069868">I don't need her.</string>
  <string id="6069869">If that's what you want.</string>
  <string id="6069870">As you wish.</string>
  <string id="6069871">It isn't what I want. But it is what she wants.</string>
  <string id="6069872">That seems a little odd.</string>
  <string id="6069873">Weird.</string>
  <string id="6069874">It is her wish, and I must grant it.</string>
  <string id="6069875">You needn't look after her. Simply take her to the city.</string>
  <string id="6069880">You owe us, Isabela.</string>
  <string id="6069883">Well, Lucky, I'll tell you what...</string>
  <string id="6069886">Since the information you gave me was worth nothing...</string>
  <string id="6069889">... that's what I'll pay you.</string>
  <string id="6069892">Me and my boys will get our money's worth, bitch.</string>
  <string id="6069895">Oh, you poor, sweet thing.</string>
  <string id="6069901">Tell me, Lucky, is this worth dying for?</string>
  <string id="6069907">Chuckles I didn't think so.</string>
  <string id="6069910">What did you do?</string>
  <string id="6069911">I'm no fool. I know the Qunari are waiting for something, and it isn't rescue.</string>
  <string id="6069914">You and I have had no dealings. But you've made this city your home, and it needs you.</string>
  <string id="6069917">I remember how you helped my son. It seems you are meant to have influence above your station.</string>
  <string id="6069920">Speak to the Arishok. Give him what he needs to keep the peace. Can you do that for Kirkwall, Serah Hawke?</string>
  <string id="6069921">Is this a paid position? I'm somewhat in demand.</string>
  <string id="6069922">I'll help for a price.</string>
  <string id="6069924">You must have better talkers on your staff.</string>
  <string id="6069925">I'm no diplomat.</string>
  <string id="6069926">You've served yourself, built a fortune. I give you that.</string>
  <string id="6069938">That should be the last of them.</string>
  <string id="6069945">You'll find Merrill waiting for you on the trail just up the mountain. Dareth shiral.</string>
  <string id="6069948">They're all dead?</string>
  <string id="6069951">I... I can't believe it.</string>
  <string id="6069954">It's a miracle any of us lived.</string>
  <string id="6069957">I'll tell Lieutenant Jalen at the Keep what you've done. I'll make sure he rewards you.</string>
  <string id="6069960">Men, we're heading home.</string>
  <string id="6069979">Tell me about Sam.</string>
  <string id="6069980">Who's Wall-Eyed Sam?</string>
  <string id="6069983">Martin says Sam's a bit of a magpie, picking up things that don't belong to him. Not a trustworthy sort.</string>
  <string id="6070007">Where is the relic?</string>
  <string id="6070013">I... er... I have it.</string>
  <string id="6070019">The Tome of Koslun will not fall into Tevinter hands!</string>
  <string id="6070022">Blood and spite!</string>
  <string id="6070025">Ataash Qunari!</string>
  <string id="6070031">He's getting away!</string>
  <string id="6070040">I'm busy right now. I'll get to it if I can.</string>
  <string id="6070041">I'll think about it.</string>
  <string id="6070042">Well someone needs to, or I will never get that mine open!</string>
  <string id="6070092">Turned away, many times. No, this request was very specific.</string>
  <string id="6070099">I am always willing to assist.</string>
  <string id="6070100">Of course I'll help.</string>
  <string id="6070101">The Arishok is waiting for you.</string>
  <string id="6070104">Serve your city and then we will talk about what you are due. The Arishok is waiting.</string>
  <string id="6070107">I don't have any boats in here, so you can stop coming around.</string>
  <string id="6070110">Sighs I do think about things other than boats and sex, you know.</string>
  <string id="6070113">What now?</string>
  <string id="6070116">But, if you—and only you—cannot calm this situation, I fear the only reliable investment will be in swords and armor.</string>
  <string id="6070119">That is an attitude this city has lacked for a long time.</string>
  <string id="6070122">Appease the Arishok. Take his demand and let him return to dormancy.</string>
  <string id="6070125">As awkward as this has been, it is better than the alternative.</string>
  <string id="6070126">Sounds like you'd be better off without this headache.</string>
  <string id="6070127">Why not expel the Qunari?</string>
  <string id="6070128">Any idea what I can expect?</string>
  <string id="6070129">What does the Arishok want?</string>
  <string id="6070130">I've seen hate for them, but I haven't heard anything major in years.</string>
  <string id="6070131">Who is against the Qunari?</string>
  <string id="6070132">Antivan Camp</string>
  <string id="6070133">Vincento's Northern Merchandise</string>
  <string id="6070135">You better get going. Try not to get eaten.</string>
  <string id="6070136">Run for your life.</string>
  <string id="6070137">They will not leave, and we don't have the resources to force the issue.</string>
  <string id="6070140">At least, not in a way that would leave the city intact. If they had come to conquer, I suspect they would have done so.</string>
  <string id="6070144">None. Honestly, I don't think I've heard two direct words from the Arishok.</string>
  <string id="6070147">Other than his rather deliberate phrasing of begone.</string>
  <string id="6070150">If you think his asking me to notify you of this is strange, well, you would be right.</string>
  <string id="6070151">Zealots are bravest where their lies can't be argued: behind closed doors.</string>
  <string id="6070154">Chantry leaders see Qunari beliefs as a challenge, not an attack. But the message gets muddled among casual adherents.</string>
  <string id="6070157">I am certainly not equipped to argue the fine points of faith.</string>
  <string id="6070166">Have the years been kind to Saemus?</string>
  <string id="6070167">How is your son?</string>
  <string id="6070168">It is dividing the city, and my own home. My son is quite... fervent in his defense of them.</string>
  <string id="6070171">If only we all had the luxury of remaining young and foolish.</string>
  <string id="6070172">He is his own man, but your actions tempered him somewhat. He is not so angry at the world.</string>
  <string id="6070175">I thank you for that. I may not agree with him on many things, but I am proud of what he is becoming.</string>
  <string id="6070179">Maker, what a mess.</string>
  <string id="6070180">It's heading for a fall, I know it is.</string>
  <string id="6070181">I should spend more time with my boy. This life is too short.</string>
  <string id="6070182">Stepping down is looking more and more appealing.</string>
  <string id="6070192">Do the Qunari look like the sharing type to you? Of course they want it back!</string>
  <string id="6070193">Are you crazy?</string>
  <string id="6070197">Years of nice, quiet anxiety... gone. Along with a whole street.</string>
  <string id="6070198">I've always known what the relic is. I just didn't want to... worry you.</string>
  <string id="6070208">Since you did so much more than I was expecting, how about we work together?</string>
  <string id="6070211">I am offering a fifty-fifty share in the mine. You will make us both rich if you can keep your countrymen safe.</string>
  <string id="6070212">I'll see what I can do.</string>
  <string id="6070215">Seems like the miners could use protection... and an advocate.</string>
  <string id="6070216">I'll do it for the workers.</string>
  <string id="6070217">I own half the mine now. I'll keep it safe.</string>
  <string id="6070218">I can protect you.</string>
  <string id="6070219">Shuffle off to the mine, and let me finish those pints for you.</string>
  <string id="6070220">You've had your fun.</string>
  <string id="6070224">I convinced the miners to return to work.</string>
  <string id="6070233">The miners agreed to return to work, but I had to double their wages.</string>
  <string id="6070236">What? That is coin out of both our pockets!</string>
  <string id="6070239">I will excuse you this once—you are new to this. In the future, let me handle the coin. You handle the danger.</string>
  <string id="6070240">I made the call. Don't second guess me.</string>
  <string id="6070241">What's done is done.</string>
  <string id="6070242">Excellent! I knew you would handle those layabouts.</string>
  <string id="6070248">We weren't sure his information was reliable, but contacting you or Varric was deemed risky.</string>
  <string id="6070249">After the Warden-Commander killed the Architect, we thought it would be decades before the Deep Roads would be infested again.</string>
  <string id="6070252">After the Warden-Commander spared the Architect, we thought the ensuing struggle among the darkspawn might make the Deep Roads safer.</string>
  <string id="6070261">Nathaniel was found but was then left to fend for himself.</string>
  <string id="6070262">Your party is likely dead, Nathaniel. Let's go before we join them.</string>
  <string id="6070263">Forget your friends.</string>
  <string id="6070264">Perhaps you are right, but I will not desert them.</string>
  <string id="6070267">I would greatly appreciate your aid, but I'll understand if you turn back.</string>
  <string id="6070335">Lieutenant Harley said I should see you about a reward.</string>
  <string id="6070338">That's it? Not even going to mention your scuffle with Evets Marauders? Killing the whole lot of them?</string>
  <string id="6070339">They killed a lot of good people.</string>
  <string id="6070340">I wish I'd been there sooner.</string>
  <string id="6070341">They won't kill anyone else, thanks to you.</string>
  <string id="6070342">That does ring a bell. Hard to remember... I've killed so many things.</string>
  <string id="6070343">I kill a lot of people.</string>
  <string id="6070344">I believe that, I do.</string>
  <string id="6070351">Common murderers and thieves. I dealt with them.</string>
  <string id="6070352">No one will miss them.</string>
  <string id="6070359">There's one small rub, though. Their leader, Evets, wasn't there, was he?</string>
  <string id="6070364">No.</string>
  <string id="6070374">The Unbidden Rescue</string>
  <string id="6070378">I wish I could've seen you give Evets Marauders what for. Laughs</string>
  <string id="6070379">No, they were led by Fell Orden.</string>
  <string id="6070382">I don't think so. They weren't wearing name tags.</string>
  <string id="6070387">Evets is the worst of the lot. He may try to get revenge one day.</string>
  <string id="6070388">Good to know. I'll keep an eye out for him.</string>
  <string id="6070389">I'll be careful.</string>
  <string id="6070390">Maybe nothing will come of it.</string>
  <string id="6070393">I dare him to try something.</string>
  <string id="6070394">I can handle him.</string>
  <string id="6070395">Ha. He'd be a fool to, indeed.</string>
  <string id="6070409">Thanks again for your help.</string>
  <string id="6070415">I know you fear us.</string>
  <string id="6070418">Knight-Commander Meredith uses that fear to take control of your city!</string>
  <string id="6070424">She opposes every effort to replace Viscount Dumar, and you have seen the chaos of her reign! Will you allow it?</string>
  <string id="6070429">Wait!</string>
  <string id="6070432">Perhaps there are some who might disagree with you, Knight-Commander.</string>
  <string id="6070435">The Champion has proven himself Kirkwall's greatest defender. I doubt that he favors sedition.</string>
  <string id="6070436">Do not hide behind the Champion. He has no role in this.</string>
  <string id="6070440">The Champion has proven herself Kirkwall's greatest defender. I doubt that she favors sedition.</string>
  <string id="6070441">Do not hide behind the Champion. She has no role in this.</string>
  <string id="6070442">It would be better if you both calmed down, before this gets violent.</string>
  <string id="6070443">Maybe I could help.</string>
  <string id="6070444">I don't need anyone speaking for me, Knight-Commander.</string>
  <string id="6070445">I can think for myself.</string>
  <string id="6070446">Sounds like you two have quite the little argument going.</string>
  <string id="6070447">I like a good debate.</string>
  <string id="6070451">I'm so sorry, I didn't ask your name. Unless... it's not rude to ask a human their name, is it?</string>
  <string id="6070458">Talk to Seneschal Bran about the viscount's son.</string>
  <string id="6070459">Look for the viscount's son, Saemus Dumar, on the Wounded Coast.</string>
  <string id="6070460">Prepare the area for battle and then talk to Saemus.</string>
  <string id="6070461">Defend Saemus from the Winters.</string>
  <string id="6070463">The viscount’s son is now at the mercy of the Winters.</string>
  <string id="6070464">Talk to Saemus about returning to the Viscount’s Keep.</string>
  <string id="6070468">Chanter's Board</string>
  <string id="6070470">Bounty - Rescue the Viscount's Son</string>
  <string id="6070472">Gamlen's House</string>
  <string id="6070473">You didn't see that trap, there? Sorry. Laughs</string>
  <string id="6070474">Gamlen's House</string>
  <string id="6070477">I killed the thieves responsible.</string>
  <string id="6070480">The Maker has a grand sense of humor.</string>
  <string id="6070481">The Qunari were blameless.</string>
  <string id="6070482">An accident on purpose, more or less.</string>
  <string id="6070483">Longdeath, take care of those shit-eaters!</string>
  <string id="6070484">Now! Get them now!</string>
  <string id="6070485">Sophie? Void damned it all. Sophie! Get them!</string>
  <string id="6070486">You miserable bastards will die a foul and painful death!</string>
  <string id="6070489">I've heard that one before.</string>
  <string id="6070492">Jessie, kill them!</string>
  <string id="6070495">I'm Merrill. Which you probably knew already. I'm rambling, sorry.</string>
  <string id="6070496">Why are you leaving the Dalish for Kirkwall?</string>
  <string id="6070497">Why leave your clan?</string>
  <string id="6070498">We didn't get a proper introduction.</string>
  <string id="6070499">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="6070502">We've got a job to do. Don't waste time chatting.</string>
  <string id="6070503">Let's get going.</string>
  <string id="6070504">My name is Hawke. Glad to make your acquaintance, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6070505">Nice to meet you.</string>
  <string id="6070506">You'll have to work harder than that to offend me. My name's Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6070507">I don't mind rambling.</string>
  <string id="6070508">Perhaps the miners will work harder now we're paying them enough to survive.</string>
  <string id="6070509">You get what you pay for.</string>
  <string id="6070525">Yes, well, if you want to see profit any time soon, you will defer to me.</string>
  <string id="6070528">We shouldn't exploit them. They deserve more pay.</string>
  <string id="6070529">The miners deserve better.</string>
  <string id="6070543">Right. A mad elf, pushed by zealots, likely hidden in the very groups I have to appease.</string>
  <string id="6070547">Lowtown</string>
  <string id="6070548">Lowtown</string>
  <string id="6070554">Woman</string>
  <string id="6070558">Man</string>
  <string id="6070562">Elven Man</string>
  <string id="6070566">Elven Man</string>
  <string id="6070570">Woman</string>
  <string id="6070574">Man</string>
  <string id="6070576">You could have done something about the Qunari, but you didn't.</string>
  <string id="6070577">How could you be so selfish?</string>
  <string id="6070578">All this is your fault. I should've handed you over to the Qunari years ago.</string>
  <string id="6070579">This is your mess.</string>
  <string id="6070580">Sounds like the Qunari take their reading very seriously.</string>
  <string id="6070581">All this over a book?</string>
  <string id="6070582">Is there anything the Qunari don't take seriously?</string>
  <string id="6070584">How did you steal the relic from the Qunari?</string>
  <string id="6070585">You stole the relic?</string>
  <string id="6070589">The rescue of the viscount’s son was left to a group of mercenaries.</string>
  <string id="6070594">Mountain Cave</string>
  <string id="6070595">Nuncio</string>
  <string id="6070597">Variel</string>
  <string id="6070599">I have to. Let's leave it at that for now, all right?</string>
  <string id="6070600">I am—or was, I suppose—the First to Keeper Marethari.</string>
  <string id="6070603">I've studied the old ways for as long as I can remember.</string>
  <string id="6070606">I know things—the lore of the Dalish—that can help us get to the summit of Sundermount.</string>
  <string id="6070607">Be careful up ahead. Restless things prowl the heights.</string>
  <string id="6070610">In the days of Arlathan, the elders came here to sleep. Uthenera. The endless dream, they called it.</string>
  <string id="6070613">But they don't sleep peacefully anymore.</string>
  <string id="6070614">Don't mind Hawke, miss. Fereldans aren't exactly famous for their manners. Varric Tethras at your service.</string>
  <string id="6070616">Zevran</string>
  <string id="6070738">Apparel Shop</string>
  <string id="6070754">Trinkets Emporium</string>
  <string id="6070765">Apparel Shop</string>
  <string id="6070767">I'm Anders. Don't let Hawke's grumpiness bother you. I'd call this an off-day, but they're pretty much all like this.</string>
  <string id="6070776">Trinkets Emporium</string>
  <string id="6070788">He's a hair from the edge. You need to keep everyone calm.</string>
  <string id="6070789">He'll be dangerous soon.</string>
  <string id="6070790">Keep the worst of them off his back and it will be all right.</string>
  <string id="6070791">Just don't give in to zealots.</string>
  <string id="6070792">You could send him gold and he'd complain it was heavy.</string>
  <string id="6070793">What doesn't annoy him?</string>
  <string id="6070794">But that is the problem. It has already escalated, despite your efforts. A shame.</string>
  <string id="6070796">And it's about to get worse. A shame, there were overtures of civility. Your influence, no doubt.</string>
  <string id="6070797">Welcome, Merrill. I'm Aveline, and you've already met Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6070798">Despite what my brother would have you believe, we weren't raised by rabid brontos. I'm Bethany Hawke, by the way.</string>
  <string id="6070799">Ignore my older brother, miss. He's being more of an ass than usual. I'm Carver Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6070800">Fenris. And this is Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6070801">Welcome aboard, love! I'm Isabela. Don't mind Hawke. Someone's got their knickers in a knot today.</string>
  <string id="6070802">I know little of outsiders. No chatting is for the best. I'd probably say a lot of things that are very stupid.</string>
  <string id="6070803">Thank you. I'm afraid I'm not very experienced with your kind.</string>
  <string id="6070810">I've come to you in search of aid. An elven assassin I have been chasing is loose in the area.</string>
  <string id="6070811">I'll see what I can do.</string>
  <string id="6070812">Fine.</string>
  <string id="6070814">I'm not interested.</string>
  <string id="6070815">No thanks.</string>
  <string id="6070816">Ah, that's a shame. Well, good day to you, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6070817">Shady Merchandise</string>
  <string id="6070820">Shady Merchandise</string>
  <string id="6070822">I admire conviction with a focus, but your kind are truly committed to weakness.</string>
  <string id="6070831">My sister is better at stabbing things than making conversation. I'm Bethany Hawke. Pleased to meet you.</string>
  <string id="6070832">My sister, as charming as ever. I'm Carver Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6070834">Nuncio wants you to hunt down a famed elven assassin from Antiva. Ask Variel in the Dalish camp where he might be hiding.</string>
  <string id="6070838">Done what? The blighted thing didn't show up for three years!</string>
  <string id="6070839">Search for the Antivan assassin in a nearby mountain cave.</string>
  <string id="6070842">Report back to Nuncio at his campsite outside Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6070843">Report back to Nuncio at his campsite outside Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6070845">Kill Nuncio and the Crow assassins.</string>
  <string id="6070846">Help Zevran kill Nuncio and the Crow assassins.</string>
  <string id="6070847">Zevran was thankful and offered a reward.</string>
  <string id="6070872">And what would that have accomplished? They don't want me, they want the relic!</string>
  <string id="6070876">So, I was wrong about our thief.</string>
  <string id="6070879">Very.</string>
  <string id="6070882">It appears so.</string>
  <string id="6070885">You'll get used to it.</string>
  <string id="6070888">This elf was determined to lay blame at our feet.</string>
  <string id="6070891">We have but one weapon—the certainty of the Qun. It cannot be used against us.</string>
  <string id="6070892">That weak elf made a good effort at using your own weapon against you.</string>
  <string id="6070893">She almost beat you.</string>
  <string id="6070896">I must admit, I was waiting for an assault by the Crows, not the mighty Champion of Kirkwall!</string>
  <string id="6070905">So you can either tie me up, gag me, and then manhandle me... or you can take me to Nuncio. Which will it be, I wonder?</string>
  <string id="6070906">I'm not going to hand you over to someone who lied to me.</string>
  <string id="6070907">I won't turn you in.</string>
  <string id="6070908">None of your tricks. You're coming with me.</string>
  <string id="6070909">I'm taking you to Nuncio.</string>
  <string id="6070910">Oh, as you wish. Let us see what Nuncio has to say.</string>
  <string id="6070911">Templar Hall</string>
  <string id="6070935">Selfishness, want, denial—how do you allow this to continue?</string>
  <string id="6070974">Black Market Goods</string>
  <string id="6070975">Black Market Goods</string>
  <string id="6070980">Good day to you.</string>
  <string id="6070983">But... Asha'bellanar! One mustn't trifle with her! Terrible things will happen!</string>
  <string id="6070984">Where are you going? We can't leave yet. We haven't been to the altar!</string>
  <string id="6070985">No, no, you're going the wrong way. We've got to head up the mountain, not down.</string>
  <string id="6070986">I've heard humans have a poor sense of direction, but you do know that's the wrong way, right?</string>
  <string id="6070991">We should go. Your task is for Asha'bellanar. It's not wise to make her wait.</string>
  <string id="6070997">I am sorry we are in such disarray with Keeper Marethari gone.</string>
  <string id="6070998">Greetings, Champion. That is what they call you in your city, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6071003">Creators give you speed, shemlen. The sooner you take her away, the better.</string>
  <string id="6071007">Be on your guard. This mountain belongs to the dead.</string>
  <string id="6071010">So the Keeper finally found someone to take you from here.</string>
  <string id="6071022">Look, the book's right in this building, and I'm not letting it slip away again.</string>
  <string id="6071023">Have you changed your mind? I could use your assistance.</string>
  <string id="6071024">Then this is where we part ways. Good luck.</string>
  <string id="6071025">You're on your own.</string>
  <string id="6071026">Good luck to you as well.</string>
  <string id="6071031">Dalish Hunter</string>
  <string id="6071037">The answer is still the same, Nathaniel.</string>
  <string id="6071038">I haven't changed my mind.</string>
  <string id="6071039">Very well.</string>
  <string id="6071051">Not something you'd expect from a cruel and evil murderer, is it?</string>
  <string id="6071054">I should remain calm while a mage provokes an uprising? I think not.</string>
  <string id="6071057">Is that so?</string>
  <string id="6071060">This is not an argument. It's treason.</string>
  <string id="6071063">I think the Champion's views would be appreciated. Or do you fear what he has to say?</string>
  <string id="6071066">I think the Champion's views would be appreciated. Or do you fear what she has to say?</string>
  <string id="6071069">Not at all. Do you agree with the first enchanter's accusations, Champion?</string>
  <string id="6071070">I fear nothing. My only interest here is in keeping order and protecting the innocent.</string>
  <string id="6071071">Rogue mages are constantly threatening the city.</string>
  <string id="6071072">Meredith has a point.</string>
  <string id="6071073">Exactly. Would you have us do nothing in response?</string>
  <string id="6071076">I would have you not paint us all with the same brush! Not all mages are waiting for the opportunity to wreak havoc!</string>
  <string id="6071079">You know as well as I that temptation preys on every mage, no matter how noble their intentions.</string>
  <string id="6071082">You hear this, yes? She would lock you up too, if she were able.</string>
  <string id="6071085">The Champion saved this city, unlike some who threaten it with their misguided outrage.</string>
  <string id="6071088">You push us into desperate acts, and then use that as justification to press even further!</string>
  <string id="6071089">The templars are only making the problem worse.</string>
  <string id="6071090">Good point.</string>
  <string id="6071094">I will not sacrifice the well-being of innocents for the sake of a few mages! I will not!</string>
  <string id="6071095">Fighting her at every step has not improved things, First Enchanter.</string>
  <string id="6071096">And how are you helping?</string>
  <string id="6071100">I am through trying to help her. She will not be helped.</string>
  <string id="6071101">This argument isn't helping matters.</string>
  <string id="6071102">This is getting us nowhere.</string>
  <string id="6071103">No, it's not. Stand aside, if you will not see what is right here.</string>
  <string id="6071104">What are you trying to do here? Cause a rebellion?</string>
  <string id="6071105">Why do this now, Orsino?</string>
  <string id="6071106">The people of this city need to know what is really happening!</string>
  <string id="6071109">And then what? They tear down the Gallows with pitchforks and torches? That would be better?</string>
  <string id="6071112">It cannot be worse. Your refusal to listen to reason leaves me no choice.</string>
  <string id="6071115">What I refuse to listen to are excuses! Perhaps you are ill-fit to your position if you cannot understand this.</string>
  <string id="6071116">You're hardly receptive to whatever gets in your way.</string>
  <string id="6071117">What Orsino says is true.</string>
  <string id="6071121">And I become less receptive each moment this nonsense continues.</string>
  <string id="6071122">Whatever the cause, it does not justify your actions.</string>
  <string id="6071123">Orsino went too far.</string>
  <string id="6071127">Then lock me up, if what I've done is so wrong. She's going to do it anyway.</string>
  <string id="6071128">Threatening each other isn't going to help matters.</string>
  <string id="6071129">That's enough.</string>
  <string id="6071130">And what should I do, instead? Allow this to continue?</string>
  <string id="6071131">The first enchanter accused you of trying to take control of the city.</string>
  <string id="6071132">Answer his charges, Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6071133">The city! I am trying to keep order until there is a ruler capable of succeeding where Dumar failed.</string>
  <string id="6071136">And if not? Will the templars rule Kirkwall forever?</string>
  <string id="6071139">We will not stand idle while the city burns around us.</string>
  <string id="6071142">The Templar Order exists to guard the Chantry and Circle. I suggest you let the nobility rule the city.</string>
  <string id="6071145">I do not need you or anyone to tell me what my duty is, mage.</string>
  <string id="6071146">The first enchanter is right. You should not be ruling Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6071147">Meredith needs to step down.</string>
  <string id="6071151">And yet I shall continue, until such a time as the city is safe.</string>
  <string id="6071154">If Kirkwall wants Meredith to step down, they'll tell her to.</string>
  <string id="6071155">Let the city decide.</string>
  <string id="6071159">Are you mad? They fear her! Everyone fears her!</string>
  <string id="6071160">If Kirkwall needs a ruler, I will step in.</string>
  <string id="6071161">I will rule.</string>
  <string id="6071162">If it will keep the peace, I will step in.</string>
  <string id="6071163">I will rule.</string>
  <string id="6071164">I will step in. I certainly can't do any worse.</string>
  <string id="6071165">I will rule.</string>
  <string id="6071169">That is not going to happen.</string>
  <string id="6071172">Do you see? She is incapable of reason!</string>
  <string id="6071173">Your measures have become more extreme over the last three years.</string>
  <string id="6071174">Do the templars go too far?</string>
  <string id="6071177">And when will that end? When will you stop seeing evil in every corner?</string>
  <string id="6071180">When it's no longer there.</string>
  <string id="6071181">No matter what, Knight-Commander, he has a point.</string>
  <string id="6071182">Orsino is right.</string>
  <string id="6071183">Sorry to break it to you, Meredith, but I think you're wrong.</string>
  <string id="6071184">Orsino is right.</string>
  <string id="6071188">Face the truth, Knight-Commander. You are done.</string>
  <string id="6071191">That is for me to decide. No one else!</string>
  <string id="6071194">This is the wrong way to go about it, First Enchanter.</string>
  <string id="6071195">Meredith is right.</string>
  <string id="6071196">Sorry to break it to you, Orsino, but I think you're wrong.</string>
  <string id="6071197">Meredith is right.</string>
  <string id="6071201">Justice shall be tempered by mercy.</string>
  <string id="6071204">That has never been your code! I will not submit to this!</string>
  <string id="6071207">You're both at fault, here. I'm not supporting either of you.</string>
  <string id="6071208">Neither of you is right.</string>
  <string id="6071209">This won't be resolved here. We need to sit down and work it out.</string>
  <string id="6071210">Neither of you is right.</string>
  <string id="6071211">Maybe you two should wrestle, because there's no other way to resolve this.</string>
  <string id="6071212">Neither of you is right.</string>
  <string id="6071216">You are naive, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6071219">You will find that not everyone bows to your will, Knight-Commander.</string>
  <string id="6071225">My, my, such a terrible commotion!</string>
  <string id="6071228">This mage incites rebellion, Your Grace. I am dealing with the matter.</string>
  <string id="6071231">Ah, Orsino. So frustrated. Do you think this is truly wise?</string>
  <string id="6071234">I... no, Your Grace.</string>
  <string id="6071237">Of course not. Young men, would you show the first enchanter back to the Circle? Gently, if you please.</string>
  <string id="6071240">Your Grace! He should be clapped in irons, made an example—!</string>
  <string id="6071243">That's enough, Meredith. This demeans us all, surely you can see that? Go back to the Gallows and calm down, like a good girl.</string>
  <string id="6071249">You have my thanks for stepping in, Champion. If you had not...</string>
  <string id="6071250">I doubt sending them back to the Gallows will end this.</string>
  <string id="6071251">This will get worse.</string>
  <string id="6071252">You're the grand cleric. Aren't you in charge of the templars and Circle?</string>
  <string id="6071253">Can't you do something?</string>
  <string id="6071254">Laughs Oh my! You have quite the estimation of my abilities!</string>
  <string id="6071257">Short of putting those two in cells, I doubt anything will keep them from each other.</string>
  <string id="6071258">I doubt I changed much.</string>
  <string id="6071259">Sighs Sadly true.</string>
  <string id="6071262">Gentle people of Kirkwall... return to your homes, I implore you. This will not be solved today.</string>
  <string id="6071268">And now I must attend to the Gallows. They will see reason, if the Maker wills it. Thank you again, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6071275">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6071276">Qunari</string>
  <string id="6071280">Excellent. I was hoping you would change your mind.</string>
  <string id="6071281">If you must leave, I understand. I will wait here for a time before attempting the rescue alone.</string>
  <string id="6071282">You're going the wrong way. The survivors lay ahead, not behind us.</string>
  <string id="6071285">Then finish your task quickly, human. We cannot be rid of this one too soon.</string>
  <string id="6071291">I'm sensing a story here.</string>
  <string id="6071292">So... this is awkward. Anyone else think this is awkward? How about we move along?</string>
  <string id="6071293">The Dalish are one big, happy family.</string>
  <string id="6071294">Isn't Dalish camaraderie delightful?</string>
  <string id="6071295">Some juicy gossip here, I imagine!</string>
  <string id="6071296">This sounds... bad.</string>
  <string id="6071297">Looks less and less like leaving was voluntary.</string>
  <string id="6071298">I have made my choice. And I will save our clan, whatever you think.</string>
  <string id="6071381">When Martin gave up raiding, Sam became a drifter.</string>
  <string id="6071389">Qunari</string>
  <string id="6071391">Head to the Gallows and put a stop to Orsino's insurrection before the city is torn apart.</string>
  <string id="6071392">Head to the Gallows and defend the mages against Knight-Commander Meredith's assault.</string>
  <string id="6071393">Nuncio and the Crows were defeated.</string>
  <string id="6071435">They ran aground on a reef. I tried losing them in shallow waters and I would've succeeded if not for those contraptions.</string>
  <string id="6071479">Excellent. Killing my former brothers-in-arms is oddly satisfying.</string>
  <string id="6071480">And we all remain in one piece? Well! It is a good day, then!</string>
  <string id="6071485">Perhaps we'll meet again, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6071490">Quit your blubbering, dwarf!</string>
  <string id="6071493">Calm yourself, Javaris. You're not dead yet.</string>
  <string id="6071496">That any way to greet an old friend?</string>
  <string id="6071499">You? Granny's garters, she would hire you. I can't buy a break on discount!</string>
  <string id="6071502">You know what? Go ahead. Take my head and pike it back to that sodding elf! I need the rest.</string>

  <string id="6071505">You don't know? Then, what, you're tracking for the Qunari?</string>
  <string id="6071508">You brought this on yourself. Who else would steal their powder?</string>
  <string id="6071509">You stole from the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6071510">The Qunari powder, it's not what you think. It's poison.</string>
  <string id="6071511">Don't make the powder.</string>
  <string id="6071512">Wait, you're tracking for the Qunari?</string>
  <string id="6071515">The obvious thief was perhaps a bit too obvious.</string>
  <string id="6071516">It certainly wasn't hard to frame you.</string>
  <string id="6071517">Ah, I knew he was no burglar. We're not climbers.</string>
  <string id="6071518">So, the obvious thief claims innocence.</string>
  <string id="6071519">The theft is not as obvious as it seemed?</string>
  <string id="6071520">You're the obvious thief.</string>
  <string id="6071521">Seemed obvious you'd be the thief.</string>
  <string id="6071524">Look, I'm minding business, same old, and out of the blue some elf tries to kill me.</string>

  <string id="6071610">The Arishok never had it; the Orlesians did. They had plans to return it to the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6071613">I simply had to waylay the Orlesian convoy before it met up with the Arishok and his men.</string>
  <string id="6071616">Getting the relic was easy. Getting away from the Qunari was the hard part.</string>
  <string id="6071681">If the Tevinters get the relic, it will strike a blow to Qunari morale. That's probably what the mages want.</string>

  <string id="6071704">If you're innocent, you could plead your case to the Arishok.</string>
  <string id="6071705">Why not tell the Qunari?</string>
  <string id="6071706">Let's break this down. An elf with explosives wants me dead. Part two, the Qunari may think I'm a thief and also want me dead.</string>
  <string id="6071710">You always were a good liar.</string>
  <string id="6071711">I don't believe you.</string>
  <string id="6071712">Let me ask you something... are you exploding?</string>
  <string id="6071715">Well, then I probably don't have the sodding powder, do I?</string>
  <string id="6071718">Here, you want to drag dark into light, I had a man follow her. The elf's in Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6071719">So far, all I see is you.</string>
  <string id="6071720">So where is this elf?</string>
  <string id="6071721">Leaving the other person behind is the first step in running away. Sorry if that's inconvenient.</string>
  <string id="6071759">Of course. My apologies.</string>
  <string id="6071760">Nothing. Just ignorance. We should go.</string>
  <string id="6071761">I'm sorry. I didn't mean to— Let's go. We should hurry.</string>
  <string id="6071778">Either option seem promising? Didn't think so.</string>
  <string id="6071783">I'm sorry. You're not really seeing the Dalish at their best.</string>
  <string id="6071785">Ginnis</string>
  <string id="6071798">Nice work, but I'll take it from here.</string>
  <string id="6071799">Back off. This is my bounty.</string>
  <string id="6071817">Champion! Thank the Maker you've come!</string>
  <string id="6071822">What's happened?</string>
  <string id="6071825">Knight-Commander Meredith and the first enchanter got into a terrible argument.</string>
  <string id="6071828">The first enchanter stormed off to bring the matter before the grand cleric, but Meredith gave chase. I fear there will be blood!</string>
  <string id="6071831">First Enchanter Orsino got into a terrible argument with the knight-commander.</string>
  <string id="6071834">He stormed off to bring the matter before the grand cleric, but the knight-commander gave chase. I fear there will be blood!</string>
  <string id="6071837">Take me to them. Now.</string>
  <string id="6071838">Then take me to them, before that happens.</string>
  <string id="6071839">Wonderful. Take me to them.</string>
  <string id="6071842">We're good people that look out for each other. Just not today, apparently.</string>
  <string id="6071843">There's more going on here than you and Marethari have told me.</string>
  <string id="6071844">What did you do?</string>
  <string id="6071845">Is there anything I can do to help?</string>
  <string id="6071846">Are you all right?</string>
  <string id="6071847">But the Dalish are delightful! I was just thinking of inviting the whole clan over for tea.</string>
  <string id="6071848">They seem real friendly.</string>
  <string id="6071854">I just want to get out. With my dead guards. Thanks for that.</string>
  <string id="6071858">Hire cheap guards, Hawke kills them. Hire good guards, Hawke kills them.</string>
  <string id="6071859">What a mess of mud and blood. No resale value at all.</string>
  <string id="6071860">This a wedding ring? That's sad. People always want a set.</string>
  <string id="6071861">These guys brothers or something? Cookie-cutter.</string>
  <string id="6071862">Why can't I get his boots off? They're right there.</string>
  <string id="6071863">Upside, I don't have to pay them.</string>
  <string id="6071869">It's a misunderstanding. It doesn't matter now.</string>
  <string id="6071870">It's kind of you to ask. I'm fine.</string>
  <string id="6071871">I'm sure they'd never accept an— Oh. Right. Sarcasm.</string>
  <string id="6071883">Gold doesn't mine itself. Convince the miners to return to work, please.</string>
  <string id="6071886">Get out of my sight.</string>
  <string id="6071887">Just go before I kill you.</string>
  <string id="6071888">Better luck wherever you're bound, Javaris. The farther the better.</string>
  <string id="6071889">Then get going.</string>
  <string id="6071890">Sounds like you have a long way to go. Hopefully.</string>
  <string id="6071891">Better start if you're going.</string>
  <string id="6071892">Right. Got me a rosy future to plan out. Think I'll start by selling some boots.</string>
  <string id="6071895">Sodding bunch of... take a long breath on a short shaft you... blasted dog-lord in-roaders.</string>
  <string id="6071896">You and I are done.</string>
  <string id="6071897">You're annoying. And dead.</string>
  <string id="6071898">Good and good. Thanks to you, I've got a lot of dead gear to haul. Sodding dog-lord in-roader.</string>
  <string id="6071904">Grunts</string>
  <string id="6071907">He bothered me.</string>
  <string id="6071908">Sass mouth bastard.</string>
  <string id="6071916">The Keeper didn't mention you were a mage.</string>
  <string id="6071917">Even if my people don't appreciate my efforts, I must see this through.</string>
  <string id="6071920">Let's go. Asha'bellanar isn't known for her patience.</string>
  <string id="6071923">Really? I... wasn't expecting that. It's nice to have someone on my side, for once.</string>
  <string id="6071930">All Keepers know a bit of old magic.</string>
  <string id="6071937">The stories tell us that all elvhen once had the gift, but like so many things, it was lost.</string>
  <string id="6071940">It's a Keeper's job to remember, to restore what we can.</string>
  <string id="6071943">Can't demons possess Dalish mages?</string>
  <string id="6071944">What about demons?</string>
  <string id="6071945">Does the Chantry know about the Dalish mages?</string>
  <string id="6071946">What about templars?</string>
  <string id="6071947">Watch where you're casting those spells.</string>
  <string id="6071948">You almost hit me.</string>
  <string id="6071949">I'm glad you decided to pitch in back there.</string>
  <string id="6071950">Thanks for the help.</string>
  <string id="6071951">Please keep turning skeletons into toads for us.</string>
  <string id="6071952">Nice work.</string>
  <string id="6071953">Half a locket? A hidden story of love and loss. My life has purpose again.</string>
  <string id="6071954">Wait, no, here's the other half. Must have hired a couple.</string>
  <string id="6071955">Wonder if the children look like them. Well, before.</string>
  <string id="6071966">Dead and good riddance but... she said she was waiting for more. A lot more!</string>
  <string id="6072075">What's going on, Maecon?</string>
  <string id="6072078">Guard-Captain! There's... I can't even describe...</string>
  <string id="6072081">On your time, son.</string>
  <string id="6072084">Reports of some haze with the stench of rust and... throw-up. There was a cloud, then a... lingering mist.</string>
  <string id="6072087">Anyone caught in the cloud just went mad. Then the others just retched themselves dead.</string>
  <string id="6072090">All right, keep your post. We'll take it from here.</string>
  <string id="6072093">He's a good man. Trust that it's as bad as he says.</string>
  <string id="6072094">Madness, then lingering death. I suppose this qualifies as dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6072095">Sounds like the Qunari decoy.</string>
  <string id="6072096">We missed the initial cloud. We'll be sane when we vomit up our guts.</string>
  <string id="6072102">Let's go if we're going.</string>
  <string id="6072114">How about I shove a canary up your coal mine? Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6072117">Let's hope this elf didn't try to make enough powder to sell.</string>
  <string id="6072118">Javaris's elf at work?</string>
  <string id="6072119">Didn't sound like a merchant to me. Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6072125">All of you, I can't fight the damned air! You want to live, stay out!</string>
  <string id="6072133">Wait. Messere Hawke?</string>
  <string id="6072136">Maker, please, the street is death. There was a cloud that drove people mad, and now a seeping mist that kills.</string>
  <string id="6072142">Shit.</string>
  <string id="6072146">Messere.</string>
  <string id="6072150">But... shit.</string>
  <string id="6072151">All I can do is warn people. If someone like you dies on my watch, I'm right stuffed.</string>
  <string id="6072152">Tend the herd, boy. I'm going in.</string>
  <string id="6072153">Step aside.</string>
  <string id="6072157">You want to go in, that's your life.</string>
  <string id="6072158">There's talk... about Qunari being responsible. What kind of animals are they?</string>
  <string id="6072164">Maker... we won't last long in this. Find the source.</string>
  <string id="6072165">Gasps Very strong. We need to find the source.</string>
  <string id="6072166">That stink will shrink your stones. Find the source.</string>
  <string id="6072167">Maker... we need to stop this mist. Find the source.</string>
  <string id="6072170">Coughs We won't last for long in this. Let us find the source.</string>
  <string id="6072171">Creators... this burns. We need to get at the source.</string>
  <string id="6072172">Won't last long in this. Where's the source?</string>
  <string id="6072188">Baby. Come to Mother. Something sharp and shiny!</string>
  <string id="6072193">Is that? Serah Hawke! You have enemies.</string>
  <string id="6072196">I'm glad it's you, really. These poor people. You are a much better target!</string>
  <string id="6072200">You stole the gaatlok, what, to sell? Justify yourself!</string>
  <string id="6072201">Tell me this was an accident.</string>
  <string id="6072202">Explain yourself. Now.</string>
  <string id="6072203">Who are you? Why do this?</string>
  <string id="6072211">Hold there.</string>
  <string id="6072214">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="6072217">The name's Evets, as in Evets Marauders. The folk you killed a few years back.</string>
  <string id="6072220">Now you're going to die for what you done.</string>
  <string id="6072241">I'm not sure how much we can do for these people.</string>
  <string id="6072242">Well, if they're not with us, they're against us. Right?</string>
  <string id="6072243">These people aren't exactly helping us.</string>
  <string id="6072244">These people, they're not giving us a chance to help them.</string>
  <string id="6072247">I fear these people are beyond help.</string>
  <string id="6072248">These people are beyond help.</string>
  <string id="6072249">These people aren't giving me much choice.</string>
  <string id="6072253">The Arishok was right. The poison got the thieves.</string>
  <string id="6072256">And everyone else, it seems.</string>
  <string id="6072257">Making them even more dangerous. Hurrah for certainty.</string>
  <string id="6072258">Yes, this is much better.</string>
  <string id="6072259">I'll take comfort in his certainty when this is over.</string>
  <string id="6072260">Which sends them into a frenzy. Perfect.</string>
  <string id="6072261">Which makes things very interesting for us.</string>
  <string id="6072262">Of course, that makes them more dangerous. Great.</string>
  <string id="6072266">Time to tell the Arishok how he was right... and wrong.</string>

  <string id="6072273">I will have the tower searched. Top to bottom!</string>
  <string id="6072276">You cannot do that. You have no right!</string>
  <string id="6072279">I have every right! You are harboring blood mages, and I intend to root them out before they infect this city!</string>
  <string id="6072282">Blood magic! Where you do not see blood magic? My people cannot sneeze without you accusing them of corruption.</string>
  <string id="6072285">Do not trifle with me, mage. My patience is at an end.</string>
  <string id="6072288">A wonder that I never saw it begin!</string>
  <string id="6072289">This needs to stop.</string>
  <string id="6072290">Enough.</string>
  <string id="6072294">The Champion will not stop me. The people deserve to know just what you've done.</string>
  <string id="6072297">This does not involve you, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6072300">I called him here. I think the people deserve to know just what you've done.</string>
  <string id="6072303">What I have done is protect the people of this city, time and again.</string>
  <string id="6072306">What I have done is protect you mages from your curse and your own stupidity.</string>
  <string id="6072309">And I will not stop doing it. I will not lower our guard, I dare not!</string>
  <string id="6072310">This needs to stop.</string>
  <string id="6072311">You've gone too far, Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6072312">You can't keep pressing the mages like this.</string>
  <string id="6072313">You've gone too far, Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6072314">Does the word crazy mean anything to you?</string>
  <string id="6072315">You've gone too far, Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6072316">Meredith is right. Something must be done.</string>
  <string id="6072317">Let her do her job, Orsino.</string>
  <string id="6072318">Fighting Meredith won't help matters.</string>
  <string id="6072319">Let her do her job, Orsino.</string>
  <string id="6072320">I'd back down, if I were you.</string>
  <string id="6072321">Let her do her job, Orsino.</string>
  <string id="6072322">Why are you fighting again?</string>
  <string id="6072323">What's going on?</string>

  <string id="6072336">So... your fault, I presume?</string>
  <string id="6072339">Qunari take my people! My siblings forget their culture, then go to the Qun for purpose. We're losing them twice!</string>
  <string id="6072342">So, I get help from your people. We'll take the Qunari thunder, make some accidents, and make them hated!</string>

  <string id="6072545">The exchange is taking place soon, and we have to be there.</string>
  <string id="6072549">How do you know about the exchange?</string>
  <string id="6072550">How did you hear of the sale?</string>
  <string id="6072551">Sam's been talking to black market dealers all over Lowtown. It didn't take me long to get wind of it.</string>
  <string id="6072554">What frustrates me is that he's held on to the relic so long.</string>
  <string id="6072555">Are you certain Sam is selling the relic you lost?</string>
  <string id="6072556">You sure this is your relic?</string>
  <string id="6072557">I've had my ear to the ground for a while. There was a description of the book. It's the right one.</string>
  <string id="6072560">Book? I thought you didn't know what the relic was.</string>
  <string id="6072563">Well, I... I know it's a book. But that's all I know. It's written in a foreign tongue.</string>
  <string id="6072566">Honestly, what does it matter? It'll save me from Castillon, so I need it.</string>
  <string id="6072567">What are we waiting for? This relic could save your life.</string>
  <string id="6072568">Let's get going.</string>
  <string id="6072569">You sound as if someone just gave you a ship packed full of men and whiskey.</string>
  <string id="6072570">You're pretty excited.</string>
  <string id="6072574">Lucky</string>
  <string id="6072576">Scared Mage</string>
  <string id="6072595">I was hoping you'd say that.</string>
  <string id="6072598">Ooh, that does sound good. But this is even better! After all these years, it's finally going to be over!</string>
  <string id="6072601">Let's just get this over with. I'm sick of hearing about this stupid relic.</string>
  <string id="6072602">Fine, we'll do it.</string>
  <string id="6072603">You think I like having this thing on my mind?</string>
  <string id="6072606">Come on. The exchange is happening tonight in a Lowtown foundry.</string>

  <string id="6072635">Mage</string>
  <string id="6072639">Circle Mage</string>
  <string id="6072643">Circle Mage</string>
  <string id="6072654">Why? Why would you do such a thing?</string>
  <string id="6072660">You would have to get involved.</string>
  <string id="6072663">Good. You've found us.</string>
  <string id="6072668">Well look who decided to show up.</string>
  <string id="6072671">You came!</string>
  <string id="6072674">Is there any truth to what she's saying?</string>
  <string id="6072675">Are there more blood mages?</string>
  <string id="6072676">These are only her latest accusations, nothing more!</string>
  <string id="6072679">And what if she does not find what she's looking for? How much further will she go to root out something that isn't there?</string>
  <string id="6072682">The Champion knows better than anyone how deep the Circle's corruption goes. I must find the source!</string>
  <string id="6072683">Is that all it's ever going to be?</string>
  <string id="6072686">Are we mages to be forever persecuted for being what we are, the mere act of defending ourselves confirmation of our guilt?</string>
  <string id="6072689">You are both being ridiculous.</string>
  <string id="6072690">This fighting needs to stop.</string>
  <string id="6072691">There must be some way we can work this out.</string>
  <string id="6072692">This fighting needs to stop.</string>
  <string id="6072693">You both set quite the example for your people, you know that?</string>
  <string id="6072694">This fighting needs to stop.</string>
  <string id="6072695">What other option do we have?</string>
  <string id="6072698">Shall we look the other way? Tell the poor victims of a possessed mage that we meant no harm?</string>
  <string id="6072701">Tell me, Champion, that you have not seen with your own eyes what they can do, heard the lies of mages that seek power!</string>
  <string id="6072702">Some of us want exactly what you want, Meredith. We're not the enemy.</string>
  <string id="6072703">We're not all the same.</string>
  <string id="6072704">You can't use the actions of some to condemn them all.</string>
  <string id="6072705">They're not all the same.</string>
  <string id="6072706">I have seen that, many times over.</string>
  <string id="6072707">You're right.</string>
  <string id="6072708">And we must fight such evil! But you cannot assume it exists in us all!</string>
  <string id="6072711">They're not the only ones that lie and seek power.</string>
  <string id="6072712">That's no excuse.</string>
  <string id="6072713">You would cast us all as villains, but it is not so!</string>
  <string id="6072716">I know, and it breaks my heart to do it, but we must be vigilant.</string>
  <string id="6072719">If you cannot tell me another way, do not brand me a tyrant!</string>
  <string id="6072722">This is getting us nowhere. Grand Cleric Elthina will put a stop to this.</string>
  <string id="6072725">You will not bring her Grace into this!</string>
  <string id="6072758">Why aren't you more concerned about her supporters?</string>
  <string id="6072759">But who was behind her?</string>
  <string id="6072764">They can't leave the Free Marches without it.</string>
  <string id="6072770">I can open the way forward. One moment.</string>
  <string id="6072774">Don't you understand? The relic is the only thing that will keep Castillon from feeding me to the sharks!</string>
  <string id="6072777">Our enemies strike from shadow because they cannot stand before us. This is not a revelation.</string>
  <string id="6072783">And it doesn't matter. I am not here to fight; I am here to satisfy a demand you cannot understand.</string>
  <string id="6072789">Leave Area</string>

  <string id="6072801">She was angry to see her people losing their culture by claiming yours.</string>
  <string id="6072802">She said you take elves.</string>
  <string id="6072803">We accept those who submit to the Qun. The weak naturally seek the strong.</string>
  <string id="6072819">Your kind may force our role to change if the Qun demands.</string>
  <string id="6072820">They say we were careless with our trap, that this is our fault. But even without the saar-qamek, there would have been death.</string>
  <string id="6072825">It doesn't matter. We did not come equipped to indoctrinate. I am here to satisfy a demand you cannot understand. </string>
  <string id="6072828">And when will that be?</string>
  <string id="6072829">It's been a long time.</string>
  <string id="6072830">It's taking long enough.</string>
  <string id="6072839">It will take as long as needed. No ship is coming. There is no rescue from duty to the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6072842">I am stuck here.</string>
  <string id="6072843">That is not the understanding of city leaders and their... supporters.</string>
  <string id="6072844">You told the viscount otherwise.</string>
  <string id="6072848">You keep going on about that, but never say anything.</string>
  <string id="6072849">What is so damned important?</string>
  <string id="6072850">You could have built a ship by now, you know.</string>
  <string id="6072851">But staying was your choice.</string>
  <string id="6072855">Leave me alone! I never asked for any of this!</string>
  <string id="6072858">Screams</string>
  <string id="6072862">Should I argue the wind? Very well. Filth stole from us. Not now, not the saar-qamek. Years ago.</string>
  <string id="6072865">Let them rot. Filth stole from us. Not now, not the saar-qamek. Years ago.</string>
  <string id="6072868">It is not about a ship! Filth stole from us. Not now, not the saar-qamek. Years ago!</string>
  <string id="6072871">That is why this elf and her shadows are unimportant. That is why I do not simply walk from this pustule of a city!</string>
  <string id="6072874">Fixing your mess is not the demand of the Qun! And you should all be grateful!</string>
  <string id="6072880">Thank you, human, for your service. Leave.</string>
  <string id="6072881">The law is clear, mage. We cannot take the risk.</string>
  <string id="6072884">A simple act of greed has bound me. We are all denied Par Vollen until I alone recover what was lost under my command!</string>
  <string id="6072889">I will suffer the fools of this city no longer.</string>
  <string id="6072890">They wish demands? I will make them.</string>
  <string id="6072891">My patience... is strained.</string>
  <string id="6072904">My stock is varied. What all my wares have in common, however, is quality.</string>

  <string id="6072981">Let's head to the Hanged Man. We should talk, and I'd rather do it where I know who's spying on us.</string>

  <string id="6073784">Why they insist on thinking they can kill people like you and the Warden, I will never guess.</string>

  <string id="6073790">Yes, well. Let's see how that works out for you.</string>
  <string id="6073802">Ah, Champion. You delivered, just as I knew you would.</string>
  <string id="6073805">Boys? Let's give the Champion that much-deserved reward, shall we?</string>
  <string id="6073806">Inconspicuous Note</string>
  <string id="6073808">Dear Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
I have the relic, and I am gone. I've lost too much over this blighted thing to let it go again. I know it would be noble to return the relic to the Qunari, but that would require a better soul than I possess.&#13;
&#13;
For what it's worth, I'm sorry I lied to you again.&#13;
&#13;
Isabela</string>
  <string id="6073809">Dear Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
I have the relic, and I am gone. I'm sorry it has to be this way. You've been a loyal ally, but this is best for us both. You promised me the relic, and I know you'll fight Castillon for me, but I don't want this. I've dragged you too far into this mess already.&#13;
&#13;
You don't have to forgive me, but I hope you understand.&#13;
&#13;

  <string id="6073934">The Arishok has left me out of this action. I can't say I am upset by that.</string>
  <string id="6073935">I should be displeased that my authority has been skirted, but in all honesty...</string>

  <string id="6074061">He's a bit touchy, isn't he? Perhaps we should go see the viscount now.</string>
  <string id="6074062">He's on edge. The viscount will want to know.</string>
  <string id="6074064">You're in luck! I am always willing to talk about myself to beautiful women.</string>
  <string id="6074075">None of us do, Serah Hawke. Someone is pushing very hard, and I fear they want this to end badly.</string>

  <string id="6074326">The grand cleric has been slain by magic, the chantry destroyed.</string>
  <string id="6074329">As knight-commander of Kirkwall, I hereby invoke the Right of Annulment. Every mage in the Circle is to be executed—immediately.</string>
  <string id="6074332">The Circle didn't even do this! Champion, you can't let her! Help us stop this madness!</string>
  <string id="6074335">And I call on you to keep order! After what just occurred, you cannot deny what must be done.</string>
  <string id="6074338">And I demand you stand with us! Even you must see that this outrage cannot be tolerated.</string>
  <string id="6074341">This... is chaos. We must help the knight-commander!</string>
  <string id="6074344">No! This wasn't their fault! You can't possibly want to slaughter innocent people, can you?</string>
  <string id="6074347">It can't be stopped now. You have to choose.</string>
  <string id="6074348">Do you realize what you've started, here?</string>
  <string id="6074349">Anders, you did this?</string>
  <string id="6074353">I do. I'm sorry I couldn't tell you earlier.</string>
  <string id="6074356">The Circle is an injustice, in many places beyond Kirkwall. The world needs to see.</string>
  <string id="6074359">You fool! You've doomed us all!</string>
  <string id="6074362">We were already doomed. A quick death now or a slow one later—I'd rather die fighting.</string>
  <string id="6074363">You're a murderer. The grand cleric, the mages... their blood is on your hands!</string>
  <string id="6074364">What about the victims?</string>
  <string id="6074365">I know.</string>
  <string id="6074368">The Circle does more harm than good.</string>
  <string id="6074369">Maybe you're right.</string>
  <string id="6074370">You may have turned everyone against the mages now.</string>
  <string id="6074371">This might make it worse.</string>
  <string id="6074372">Was anyone ever with us?</string>
  <string id="6074375">It doesn't matter. Even if I wished to, I could not stay my hand. The people will demand blood.</string>
  <string id="6074376">I don't want to get involved in this.</string>
  <string id="6074377">I'm not taking sides.</string>
  <string id="6074378">You are already involved.</string>
  <string id="6074381">You are the Champion of Kirkwall. Do your duty, or fall with the other apostates.</string>

  <string id="6074386">I will support the mages.</string>
  <string id="6074387">This won't be easy, but I'll defend you.</string>
  <string id="6074388">I will support the mages.</string>
  <string id="6074392">Hawke, if you do this, I don't know if I can follow.</string>
  <string id="6074395">I must stand for order, Hawke. Against you, if need be.</string>
  <string id="6074401">After all the evil that magic has wrought, you would still support them?</string>
  <string id="6074404">The mages here would become magisters, if they could. Do not let them.</string>
  <string id="6074407">And so you would defend these mages, after all they have done? Throw yourself at a hopeless cause?</string>
  <string id="6074410">You sure about this? Even you might not win this fight.</string>
  <string id="6074416">These templars will kill everyone if we stand by and do nothing.</string>
  <string id="6074419">I know we can do this. I believe in you, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6074426">Think carefully, Champion. Stand with them and you share their fate.</string>
  <string id="6074427">I would prefer their fate to yours.</string>
  <string id="6074428">I've already made my choice.</string>
  <string id="6074429">I'm not helping you, Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6074430">I've already made my choice.</string>
  <string id="6074431">I can live with that.</string>
  <string id="6074432">I've already made my choice.</string>
  <string id="6074433">You've convinced me, Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6074434">Then I stand with you.</string>
  <string id="6074435">Very wise.</string>
  <string id="6074444">As you wish. The die is cast.</string>
  <string id="6074447">Then... I won't abandon you. I owe you too much.</string>
  <string id="6074450">Then... you've made your decision. And I'm making mine.</string>
  <string id="6074453">Stop them! I will warn the others!</string>
  <string id="6074456">Gather our forces! We will deal with this.</string>
  <string id="6074457">Order must be restored.</string>
  <string id="6074458">I will support the templars.</string>
  <string id="6074459">It seems I have no choice but to side with you.</string>
  <string id="6074460">I will support the templars.</string>
  <string id="6074461">I guess you've got yourself a champion.</string>
  <string id="6074462">I will support the templars.</string>
  <string id="6074466">Are you mad? The templars won't be satisfied until we're all dead!</string>
  <string id="6074469">You can't side with her! Please, I can't support this!</string>
  <string id="6074472">Please, don't do this. You must know in your heart this is wrong!</string>
  <string id="6074475">She is a monster! If you help her, you become one as well.</string>
  <string id="6074478">It's unfortunate, but it's the only way.</string>
  <string id="6074481">The mages cannot hide behind their rights when they endanger so many.</string>
  <string id="6074484">Don't do this. Don't make me choose between my people and my family.</string>
  <string id="6074487">Champion! You have to know Meredith will turn against you as well!</string>
  <string id="6074488">Think carefully, Champion. This is not justice.</string>
  <string id="6074489">It's done.</string>
  <string id="6074490">I've already made my choice.</string>
  <string id="6074491">I'm not defending you, Orsino.</string>
  <string id="6074492">I've already made my choice.</string>
  <string id="6074493">Sorry, but you're on your own.</string>
  <string id="6074494">I've already made my choice.</string>
  <string id="6074495">You've convinced me, Orsino.</string>
  <string id="6074496">Then I will help the mages.</string>
  <string id="6074497">Thank the Maker!</string>
  <string id="6074503">It is a mistake, but I won't abandon you.</string>
  <string id="6074506">No. I won't fight to save these mages... not for you, not for anyone.</string>
  <string id="6074512">I see what you are trying to do, and my place... is with you.</string>
  <string id="6074515">I'm sorry, but my duty is clear. I cannot support you in this.</string>
  <string id="6074518">You are a fool, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6074521">Kill them all! I will rouse the rest of the Order!</string>
  <string id="6074524">Go! Get to the Gallows before it's too late.</string>

  <string id="6074964">Exit</string>
  <string id="6074968">What do you want, Hawke? I have no interest in adding to my distractions.</string>
  <string id="6074976">Lead the way.</string>
  <string id="6074977">I think Bianca's gotten scratched...</string>
  <string id="6074981">She didn't tell you?</string>
  <string id="6074984">I told her enough!</string>
  <string id="6074987">I told him enough!</string>
  <string id="6074997">And yet you sent a delegate to the viscount.</string>
  <string id="6075000">A brief attempt to educate. If the dwarf had stolen the saar-qamek, it could have been used to show the price of greed.</string>
  <string id="6075003">But you know the outcome of that. These fools are determined to be wrong. I won't waste the effort again.</string>
  <string id="6075013">Which Area?</string>

  <string id="6075044">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="6075045">Get on with it.</string>
  <string id="6075046">It must have taken a lot of practice to say that all in one breath.</string>
  <string id="6075047">That's quite the name.</string>
  <string id="6075051">A courtesy, Arishok. The delegate and his guards are missing.</string>
  <string id="6075052">Your delegate is missing.</string>
  <string id="6075053">Your mood is bad enough. I'll leave.</string>
  <string id="6075054">I won't trouble you further.</string>
  <string id="6075058">So it's come to this.</string>
  <string id="6075061">I don't know if we can win this war, Champion, but... thank you.</string>
  <string id="6075067">I will leave your... friend for you to deal with. I must return to the Gallows. Meet me there as soon as you can.</string>
  <string id="6075075">I must gather my forces at the Gallows—meet me there as soon as you can, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6075078">I'll leave this... murderer for you to deal with. He's your companion. Do as you see fit.</string>
  <string id="6075084">There's nothing you can say that I haven't already said to myself.</string>
  <string id="6075090">I took a spirit into my soul and changed myself forever to achieve this. This is the justice all mages have awaited.</string>
  <string id="6075091">Did that spirit tell you to do this?</string>
  <string id="6075092">This is the will of Justice?</string>
  <string id="6075093">No.</string>
  <string id="6075096">When we merged, he ceased to be. We are one now.</string>
  <string id="6075099">I can no more ignore the injustice of the Circle than he could.</string>
  <string id="6075100">So you start a massacre to prove a point?</string>
  <string id="6075101">Any means to an end?</string>
  <string id="6075102">I'm not proving a point. I'm changing a world.</string>
  <string id="6075105">You really think this is the answer?</string>
  <string id="6075106">I hope you're right.</string>
  <string id="6075107">Things can't stay as they are.</string>
  <string id="6075110">So it's up to you to decide how things should be?</string>
  <string id="6075111">That's a convenient excuse.</string>
  <string id="6075112">It's obvious how things shouldn't be.</string>
  <string id="6075115">You've never been part of the Circle. I have!</string>
  <string id="6075118">The people fear what we can do, but to use that fear to bludgeon us into submission is wrong! And they do it with our blessing!</string>
  <string id="6075121"> I might have understood, if you'd only told me.</string>
  <string id="6075122">You could have trusted me.</string>
  <string id="6075123">I wanted to tell you.</string>
  <string id="6075126">But what if you stopped me? Or worse, what if you wanted to help? I couldn't let you do that.</string>
  <string id="6075129">The world needs to see this. Then we can all stop pretending the Circle is a solution.</string>
  <string id="6075132">And if I pay for that with my life... then I pay. Perhaps then Justice would at least be free.</string>
  <string id="6075133">Opinions?</string>
  <string id="6075134">What do the others think?</string>
  <string id="6075135">Help me restore order.</string>
  <string id="6075136">Come with me.</string>
  <string id="6075137">Help me defend the mages.</string>
  <string id="6075138">Come with me.</string>
  <string id="6075139">You have to pay for what you've done.</string>
  <string id="6075140">Then you die.</string>
  <string id="6075141">Just go.</string>
  <string id="6075142">Get out of here.</string>
  <string id="6075146">You don't seem the type to hunt assassins. Why are you after him?</string>
  <string id="6075147">Why would a noble hunt him?</string>
  <string id="6075150">I'm a busy man, Hawke. Have your people contact my people, and I'll try to work you in.</string>
  <string id="6075151">Of course, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6075154">Don't make me break your heart again, Hawke. You know we'd never work out.</string>
  <string id="6075155">For you, I have all the time in the world.</string>
  <string id="6075159">Anyone else, and those words would have been their last.</string>
  <string id="6075162">Unfortunately, he's hidden himself among the local Dalish, no doubt playing on their shared heritage.</string>
  <string id="6075163">At first it was merely duty to Antiva, but after losing so many good men to him, it became personal.</string>
  <string id="6075164">You must be Brekker.</string>
  <string id="6075167">And you're that lice-covered refugee.</string>
  <string id="6075168">You'd better leave the Bone Pit shipments alone, understand?</string>
  <string id="6075169">Stop attacking my shipments.</string>
  <string id="6075170">You're making demands of me?</string>
  <string id="6075173">Hope you enjoyed saying that. Those are the last words you'll ever speak.</string>
  <string id="6075174">Now you die.</string>
  <string id="6075189">You are handling this? Not your buffoon of a viscount?</string>
  <string id="6075196">A wise choice.</string>
  <string id="6075198">Should have quit sooner. Your delegate is missing.</string>
  <string id="6075199">Your delegate is missing.</string>
  <string id="6075200">I'll probably regret this, but you should know your delegate is missing.</string>
  <string id="6075201">Your delegate is missing.</string>
  <string id="6075202">With prejudice.</string>
  <string id="6075205">I am.</string>
  <string id="6075208">As best I can.</string>
  <string id="6075211">Then I will wait. But know this: the provocations we have suffered have worked.</string>
  <string id="6075215">You're new around here, aren't you? Welcome, and keep your wits about you.</string>
  <string id="6075218">You're nothing but tits and ass to the men in this place, and they won't hesitate to grab at both.</string>
  <string id="6075219">Thanks for the advice.</string>
  <string id="6075220">Good to know.</string>
  <string id="6075221">Anytime.</string>
  <string id="6075224">Speaking from experience, are we?</string>
  <string id="6075225">How do you know?</string>
  <string id="6075226">Chuckles After a few broken fingers here and there, they got the idea.</string>
  <string id="6075229">I can look after myself.</string>
  <string id="6075230">I don't need your help.</string>
  <string id="6075231">Good. I like to see a woman with confidence.</string>
  <string id="6075234">My, and here I thought the only men in this place were besotted fools who couldn't hoist the mainsail.</string>
  <string id="6075235">You mean like the men you sent scrambling from the tavern?</string>
  <string id="6075236">Like the men you fought?</string>
  <string id="6075237">Exactly like them. Worthless twits.</string>
  <string id="6075240">When you talk about hoisting the mainsail, what do you really mean?</string>
  <string id="6075241">Hoist the mainsail?</string>
  <string id="6075242">What else could it mean? It requires strength, knowledge of rigging, and a small measure of sobriety.</string>
  <string id="6075245">I know my way around rigging just fine... and I'm good with my hands.</string>
  <string id="6075248">Oh my...</string>
  <string id="6075251">You haven't met me.</string>
  <string id="6075252">I'm different.</string>
  <string id="6075253">Mmm, yes... though I'd like to.</string>
  <string id="6075256">I'm Isabela. Previously Captain Isabela. Sadly, without my ship, the title rings a bit hollow.</string>
  <string id="6075259">You know, you might be just what I'm looking for to solve a little problem I have.</string>
  <string id="6075260">I'm always ready to help.</string>
  <string id="6075261">What do you need?</string>
  <string id="6075262">Can't anyone fix their own lives around here?</string>
  <string id="6075263">You too?</string>
  <string id="6075264">Must be something in the water.</string>
  <string id="6075267">Solve your own problems.</string>
  <string id="6075268">Why should I care?</string>
  <string id="6075269">You haven't even heard me out. There's excitement to be had—or coin, if excitement isn't your thing.</string>
  <string id="6075272">Someone from my past has been pestering me. I've arranged for a duel—if I win, he leaves me alone.</string>
  <string id="6075275">But I don't trust him to play fair. I need someone to watch my back.</string>
  <string id="6075276">What makes you think I'm right for this?</string>
  <string id="6075277">Why me?</string>
  <string id="6075278">You saw me talking to Lucky, didn't you? Those boys couldn't manage simple information-gathering.</string>
  <string id="6075281">I can't trust the riffraff in this place to do anything right. But you... you're different.</string>
  <string id="6075282">Who's this person you've arranged to meet?</string>
  <string id="6075283">Someone from your past?</string>
  <string id="6075284">His name is Hayder. We worked together back in Antiva. He's never liked me.</string>
  <string id="6075287">He's been asking about me all around Kirkwall. Thought I'd get it over with and meet him face-to-face.</string>
  <string id="6075288">Why a duel?</string>
  <string id="6075289">A duel?</string>
  <string id="6075290">And if I win, he'll be dead. Problem solved!</string>
  <string id="6075291">I think I could manage watching your back.</string>
  <string id="6075292">I'll do it.</string>
  <string id="6075293">Chuckles I'll bet.</string>
  <string id="6075296">I've arranged to meet Hayder in Hightown after dark. I'll meet you there.</string>
  <string id="6075299">I'm busy. Perhaps later.</string>
  <string id="6075300">I can't help right now.</string>
  <string id="6075301">I'm meeting Hayder in Hightown after dark. I'll be there if you change your mind.</string>
  <string id="6075315">You're Fereldan, aren't you? You have that look about you. I was in Denerim not too long ago.</string>
  <string id="6075318">I even met the Hero of Ferelden, if you know what I mean.</string>
  <string id="6075323">If this is not resolved, I can fulfill my duty to the Qun with far less annoyance by sifting through rubble.</string>
  <string id="6075327">Ah, the Champion of Kirkwall. Your reputation precedes you.</string>
  <string id="6075328">It's mostly to impress the ladies, I assure you.</string>
  <string id="6075334">Actually, I've been meaning to talk to you.</string>
  <string id="6075345">As if there wasn't enough to worry about.</string>
  <string id="6075347">Big fellow sure knows how to put a mind at ease, hmm?</string>
  <string id="6075348">As if there wasn't enough pressure.</string>
  <string id="6075349">As if there wasn't enough pressure.</string>
  <string id="6075350">You know, I think we were under enough pressure without the help.</string>
  <string id="6075351">As if there wasn't enough to worry about.</string>
  <string id="6075356">These interruptions grow tiresome, human. Talking about this city is pointless.</string>
  <string id="6075358">Start Quest</string>
  <string id="6075359">Start Quest</string>
  <string id="6075374">I leave this to you, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6075375">I am eager to see how you resolve this.</string>
  <string id="6075377">Chuckles I like duels. It's what I do.</string>
  <string id="6075380">You wanted information from Lucky. What was it?</string>
  <string id="6075381">What did you ask of Lucky?</string>
  <string id="6075385">I asked Lucky and his boys to track down something I lost. They failed to do it.</string>
  <string id="6075388">It's nothing to worry about, and this is much more important.</string>
  <string id="6075392">How do you know I'm the Champion?</string>
  <string id="6075393">You've heard of me?</string>
  <string id="6075394">Ah, let me guess: a man named Nuncio has asked you to capture a dangerous killer, yes?</string>
  <string id="6075398">I've been hired to find and capture you.</string>
  <string id="6075399">I'm here to take you in.</string>
  <string id="6075400">I'm surprised you'd let yourself be cornered like this.</string>
  <string id="6075401">You waited to be attacked?</string>
  <string id="6075417">Hayder sent them. Search the bodies. I need to find out where he is.</string>
  <string id="6075421">There you are.</string>
  <string id="6075424">Oh, it's you. I wasn't expecting to see you here.</string>
  <string id="6075427">I've been here for hours. Hayder hasn't shown up. No one has. I don't like this.</string>
  <string id="6075442">The coin is all mine, boys. And the Maker's waiting for me. No matter what I do.</string>
  <string id="6075443">A toast on me, because I found out Qunari bleed like everyone else.</string>
  <string id="6075444">Easy money, and the others took the oxmen before they could blink.</string>
  <string id="6075445">Fool horn-heads had their swords tied. The others took them down easy.</string>
  <string id="6075451">Castillon isn't a very happy person, is he? Maybe he needs a new hobby.</string>
  <string id="6075452">Castillon needs to cheer up.</string>
  <string id="6075463">A lot of coin for this place.</string>
  <string id="6075466">Well, you're throwing coins around like there's no tomorrow.</string>
  <string id="6075469">Rich spending. Bit over your head, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6075472">Hit it big, did you?</string>
  <string id="6075475">Expensive tastes for this place.</string>
  <string id="6075478">Expensive tastes for this place.</string>
  <string id="6075481">Expensive tastes for this place.</string>
  <string id="6075484">That's right, pal. Tonight I'm paid and blessed. And all I had to do was turn my head.</string>
  <string id="6075487">To all my friends!</string>
  <string id="6075493">Hey, step back. I know important people. We're going to show this city what to do with heathen oxmen.</string>
  <string id="6075496">So, someone paid you to take a Qunari delegate?</string>
  <string id="6075497">You helped kidnap Qunari?</string>
  <string id="6075500">The First Sacrifice</string>
  <string id="6075510">There is still some time before the templars attack the Gallows. Tell Orsino when all preparations are complete.</string>
  <string id="6075511">There is still some time before the templars attack the Gallows. Tell Meredith when all preparations are complete.</string>
  <string id="6075521">That's right, woman. Tonight I'm paid and blessed. And all I had to do was turn my head.</string>
  <string id="6075528">Someone has deep pockets. I want an introduction.</string>
  <string id="6075529">I want to meet your boss.</string>
  <string id="6075532">Let's see how you do when your target doesn't have their weapon bound.</string>
  <string id="6075533">First we fight, then we talk.</string>
  <string id="6075551">Listen, Hawke... I'm so sorry about what happened... you know, back there.</string>
  <string id="6075554">That whole time we were in the Fade, nothing felt real. Which... makes sense, considering.</string>
  <string id="6075556">Somebody always wants something. But I don't have to take that anymore. Three horn-heads are just a start.</string>
  <string id="6075559">You want some of this? Take it from me and my new friends!</string>
  <string id="6075570">I'll assume you're not talking about birds.</string>
  <string id="6075571">An assault by the Crows?</string>
  <string id="6075572">Oh, please do not tell me you know nothing of the Antivan Crows!</string>
  <string id="6075575">Or, I should say, they are. I am no longer a Crow, a fact they find unacceptable.</string>
  <string id="6075579">What did he say this time? That I killed his wife? Butchered his parents? Sold his children into slavery?</string>
  <string id="6075580">Ask Jethann about Ninette. The elf works at Hightown's Blooming Rose at night.</string>
  <string id="6075598">Good coin means good friends. Come on!</string>
  <string id="6075601">That's loyalty for you. Come on!</string>
  <string id="6075602">I think I'll tag along for a while. There might be something I could do for you.</string>
  <string id="6075605">Anyway, I want you to know: I would never choose a demon over you while conscious and sober.</string>
  <string id="6075609">I made a good wage for looking away while someone tamed a horn-head. So what?</string>
  <string id="6075612">You hired Lucky to track down information on the relic?</string>
  <string id="6075613">Lucky tried to find the relic.</string>
  <string id="6075614">That's right. He insisted he knew everything that was going on in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6075617">He lied. I bet he doesn't even know everything going on in his pants.</string>
  <string id="6075639">They said I should watch out for sympathizers. Traitors. You want something, take it from me and my new friends!</string>
  <string id="6075642">Don't make me kick your ass again.</string>
  <string id="6075643">You'd better not.</string>
  <string id="6075644">I've already forgiven you, Varric. Don't worry about it.</string>
  <string id="6075645">No harm done.</string>
  <string id="6075646">So less than half the time, you're on my side, then? Thanks.</string>
  <string id="6075647">That's not comforting.</string>
  <string id="6075651">So I don't have to worry you'll run off with a desire demon unless you're passed out drunk?</string>
  <string id="6075652">You say the sweetest things.</string>
  <string id="6075653">I never touched them, but I can take the likes of you.</string>
  <string id="6075663">Whimpers</string>
  <string id="6075666">This isn't necessary, you know.</string>
  <string id="6075669">What... what do you want? I just did what he said. It was more coin than I've ever seen.</string>
  <string id="6075674">I left your teeth so you can answer me.</string>
  <string id="6075677">Feeling a little friendlier?</string>
  <string id="6075680">Good start. Now, who and where is he!</string>
  <string id="6075681">Give me a name.</string>
  <string id="6075682">I don't know. He was a templar!</string>
  <string id="6075685">That's very good. Now, just tell me who and where.</string>
  <string id="6075686">You're doing fine. Keep going.</string>
  <string id="6075687">Come on. Someone so generous, they deserve recognition.</string>
  <string id="6075688">You're on a roll.</string>
  <string id="6075689">Templar. It was a templar. I didn't get the name.</string>
  <string id="6075692">We met near the chantry. He... he said taking these Qunari was serving the Maker.</string>
  <string id="6075697">Great. A templar?</string>
  <string id="6075700">With the grand cleric's seal. How's that for interesting?</string>
  <string id="6075701">Serving the grand cleric, no less. Great.</string>
  <string id="6075702">Serving the grand cleric, no less. Great.</string>
  <string id="6075703">Serving the grand cleric, no less. Great.</string>
  <string id="6075704">Serving the grand cleric, no less. Great.</string>
  <string id="6075705">Serving the grand cleric, no less. This will be interesting.</string>
  <string id="6075706">You have got to be kidding me. A templar?</string>
  <string id="6075709">A fine joke, that. A templar?</string>
  <string id="6075712">You have got to be kidding me. A templar?</string>
  <string id="6075715">You have got to be kidding me. A templar?</string>
  <string id="6075718">You have got to be kidding me. A templar?</string>
  <string id="6075721">A templar serving the grand cleric. Great.</string>
  <string id="6075731">Or did he tell you he was a lawman from Antiva, charged with apprehending a ridiculously handsome fugitive?</string>
  <string id="6075734">I thought I smelled Antivan leather.</string>
  <string id="6075737">I could say the same, my dear. It seems we were both fortunate to find powerful friends, no?</string>
  <string id="6075740">Tell me, is this one as adventurous as our dear Warden?</string>
  <string id="6075743">We could always ask.</string>
  <string id="6075746">I do love an audience, but perhaps there are other matters to attend to first?</string>
  <string id="6075750">I swear, he even had the seal of the grand cleric! True is true!</string>
  <string id="6075766">Don't worry! I plan on never visiting your Fade again. I'll stick with the real world, thank you very much.</string>
  <string id="6075767">Well, I plan on worrying about it just a little. I do not like the idea that some Fade creature can manipulate me.</string>
  <string id="6075768">Hey! It's at least half! More like two-thirds.</string>
  <string id="6075769">I can safely say, milady, that if I am passed out drunk, I'm not running anywhere.</string>
  <string id="6075770">How do you two know each other?</string>
  <string id="6075771">You and Isabela are friends?</string>
  <string id="6075774">Prude.</string>
  <string id="6075778">You fell for the Warden.</string>
  <string id="6075784">Bold plan. Well, I thought so.</string>
  <string id="6075787">He wants to die. Kill him and be done with it.</string>
  <string id="6075790">Belief is no excuse. Sincerity does not justify... this.</string>
  <string id="6075796">Make him fight the battle he has begun.</string>
  <string id="6075799">He should come with us. Do what he can to put things right.</string>
  <string id="6075802">I think I'm sick of mages and templars.</string>
  <string id="6075803">Fight with the templars. Against the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6075806">Perhaps that is the only way to make this right. Stop this war before it's too late.</string>
  <string id="6075809">No. You can't ask me to do that. I'd rather die.</string>
  <string id="6075810">You mean... stay with you?</string>
  <string id="6075813">I didn't think you'd let me. But if you do... I'll fight the templars. Damned right I will.</string>
  <string id="6075816">I know.</string>
  <string id="6075819">For what it's worth, I'm glad it's you. It was nice to be happy... for a while.</string>
  <string id="6075822">The sooner I die, the sooner my name lives on to inspire generations!</string>
  <string id="6075831">How invigorating!</string>
  <string id="6075834">We'd all best get to the Gallows, and quick. It's going to be quite a show.</string>
  <string id="6075837">Crushing the rebels, are we? How dare they wish for freedom?</string>
  <string id="6075840">How does anyone know Isabela?</string>
  <string id="6075843">Yes, well, you'll never know Isabela again if you keep that up.</string>
  <string id="6075854">I suppose you aren't a murderer at all, then.</string>
  <string id="6075855">So it's all a lie.</string>
  <string id="6075856">Stop trying to talk your way out of this, or I'll have you gagged.</string>
  <string id="6075857">I don't believe you.</string>
  <string id="6075858">Is that a promise?</string>
  <string id="6075859">He also said you were a wanted murderer.</string>
  <string id="6075860">The last one.</string>
  <string id="6075936">So this is where you live. Not bad.</string>
  <string id="6075939">I preferred the old place. It had… more charm.</string>
  <string id="6075956">...</string>
  <string id="6075959">...</string>
  <string id="6075963">So, a drunk says the grand cleric funded zealots through a rogue templar. This is enough evidence for you?</string>
  <string id="6075966">I want answers about the missing Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6075969">It's a careful chat about missing Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6075972">Don't forget the kidnapped Qunari. That too.</string>
  <string id="6075975">Hey, it's not like the templars are going to like me no matter what I do.</string>
  <string id="6075976">Sure. Why not?</string>
  <string id="6075977">Chapter the last: pissing off everyone.</string>
  <string id="6075978">Some days, Hawke...</string>
  <string id="6075979">Freedom was interesting while it lasted.</string>
  <string id="6075980">And the day started so peacefully.</string>
  <string id="6075981">So, a drunk says the grand cleric funded a rogue templar. And here we are.</string>
  <string id="6075982">So, going to accuse the grand cleric of funding zealots. On the word of a drunk.</string>
  <string id="6075983">So, you're taking the captain of the guard to accuse the grand cleric of funding zealots?</string>
  <string id="6075984">So, on the word of a drunk we intend to accuse the grand cleric of funding zealots?</string>
  <string id="6075985">So, we're about to accuse the grand cleric of funding zealots through a rogue templar.</string>
  <string id="6075986">Right. Time to accuse the grand cleric of kidnapping. Why not?</string>
  <string id="6075987">Find Templar Emeric in Darktown, and ask him what he knows about Ninette.</string>
  <string id="6075990">After dark, investigate the Lowtown foundry where Mharen's trail ended.</string>
  <string id="6075991">Find Emeric in the Gallows and show him the human remains. Also visit Ghyslain in Hightown to see if he recognizes the ring.</string>
  <string id="6075992">Emeric is continuing his investigation into the missing women.</string>
  <string id="6075998">You're talking about the shack I shared with my mother, uncle, and sister?</string>
  <string id="6075999">Charm? Are you joking?</string>
  <string id="6076000">You're talking about the shack I shared with my mother, uncle, and brother?</string>
  <string id="6076001">Charm? Are you joking?</string>
  <string id="6076002">Have you got a minute, Varric?</string>
  <string id="6076008">Hawke, I've got some news.</string>
  <string id="6076011">And maybe you should be sitting down for this. Or drunk. Or both.</string>
  <string id="6076012">You might not want to be near anything breakable when I tell you, though.</string>
  <string id="6076013">If you have something to say, Varric, say it.</string>
  <string id="6076014">Get to the point.</string>
  <string id="6076015">Right, sympathy be damned!</string>
  <string id="6076018">Yes, I know, I'm being a pansy.</string>
  <string id="6076021">Fine. Here goes.</string>
  <string id="6076024">Varric, whatever you have to tell me, it'll be fine.</string>
  <string id="6076025">You can tell me anything.</string>
  <string id="6076026">Sometimes, I wish you weren't so damned reasonable.</string>
  <string id="6076029">I know, I know.</string>
  <string id="6076032">We'll see if you still think that way in a minute.</string>
  <string id="6076035">Why don't I buy you a pint and we'll talk?</string>
  <string id="6076036">Let's get some drinks.</string>
  <string id="6076037">A pint? Try a bottle of Orlesian red. A good one. From Montsimmard.</string>
  <string id="6076040">You just keep making this harder! Although I won't say no to a pint, if you're buying.</string>
  <string id="6076043">No, no. I'll just get to the flaming point.</string>
  <string id="6076046">I've had an ear out for Bartrand. After the Deep Roads, he ran to Rivain, probably because he knew I couldn't track him.</string>
  <string id="6076049">But I hear he might be back in Kirkwall. He called in loans from a few of his contacts in Hightown.</string>
  <string id="6076050">Was he staying in Hightown, or just passing through?</string>
  <string id="6076051">Do you know where he is?</string>
  <string id="6076052">If my information is good—and it's always good—he has a house there.</string>
  <string id="6076055">Which gives us a good shot at having a word with my dear, sweet brother.</string>
  <string id="6076056">Would Bartrand really risk coming back here?</string>
  <string id="6076057">Are you sure it's him?</string>
  <string id="6076058">I think we both know by now that Bartrand would risk anything for money.</string>
  <string id="6076061">There's a much better market here for that trinket he stole. And all his contacts are in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6076062">How are you holding up, Varric?</string>
  <string id="6076063">How do you feel about this?</string>
  <string id="6076064">You're asking about me?</string>
  <string id="6076067">Carver would still be here if it weren't for Bartrand.</string>
  <string id="6076070">If it weren't for Bartrand, Bethany would still be here.</string>
  <string id="6076073">He has to answer for that. I have to set this right... as much as that's possible.</string>
  <string id="6076074">Me? My no-account, backstabbing brother is practically in arm's reach! I couldn't be better.</string>
  <string id="6076075">It's about time we paid Bartrand back.</string>
  <string id="6076076">Let's go see him.</string>
  <string id="6076077">We need some answers from your brother.</string>
  <string id="6076078">Let's go see him.</string>
  <string id="6076079">I've really missed Bartrand! We've got a lot of catching up to do.</string>
  <string id="6076080">Let's go see him.</string>
  <string id="6076081">I agree! Bianca's been missing him something awful.</string>
  <string id="6076084">Let's stop by his new house. Welcome him back to the neighborhood, and all that.</string>
  <string id="6076085">He's not worth our time.</string>
  <string id="6076086">Forget about Bartrand.</string>
  <string id="6076087">You have to let this go, Varric. Move on with your life.</string>
  <string id="6076088">Forget about Bartrand.</string>
  <string id="6076089">You know, I could live the rest of my days without ever seeing your brother again.</string>
  <string id="6076090">Forget about Bartrand.</string>
  <string id="6076091">I know you're not eager to see him again, but I don't have a choice. He's a worthless rat-bastard, but he's my brother.</string>
  <string id="6076094">I have to look him in the eye, and settle this. One way or another.</string>
  <string id="6076100">You don't like my new house?</string>
  <string id="6076101">What's wrong with this place?</string>
  <string id="6076102">I don't care what you prefer. It's my house.</string>
  <string id="6076103">So?</string>
  <string id="6076121">You and Whatshisname, that mage, seem to be getting pretty close.</string>
  <string id="6076122">People say you and that elf—you know, the angsty Tevinter one—are becoming quite the item.</string>
  <string id="6076123">I hear you and the Rivaini have something going...</string>
  <string id="6076124">There definitely seems to be something between you and Daisy these days.</string>
  <string id="6076125">You made it into Hightown. I'd expect anyone else to get complacent. But you... you must have plans.</string>
  <string id="6076144">The grand cleric, please. Tell her...</string>
  <string id="6076147">Just tell her to get out here.</string>
  <string id="6076150">Tell her it concerns the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6076153">Tell her, Three Qunari leave an estate... and let her finish.</string>
  <string id="6076159">Serah Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6076162">Sister Petrice?</string>
  <string id="6076165">Mother Petrice. Time has changed us both.</string>
  <string id="6076173">Funny how you and issues with the Qunari seem to go together.</string>
  <string id="6076174">Qunari trouble and you again.</string>
  <string id="6076181">Awakening Played</string>
  <string id="6076182">Awakening Played</string>
  <string id="6076183">Nathaniel is still a Warden</string>
  <string id="6076184">Nathaniel is still a Warden</string>
  <string id="6076201">And you always assume their side.</string>
  <string id="6076208">My personal life had better not wind up in one of your stories.</string>
  <string id="6076209">That's none of your business.</string>
  <string id="6076210">You wouldn't bring this up just to gossip. What's on your mind?</string>
  <string id="6076211">Is that a problem?</string>
  <string id="6076212">Well, well, well. I never thought you were the type, Varric. I'm flattered.</string>
  <string id="6076213">You're jealous?</string>
  <string id="6076216">I think it's time to change how Kirkwall is run.</string>
  <string id="6076217">Politics, I think.</string>
  <string id="6076218">I'd make a good noble, don't you think?</string>
  <string id="6076219">I want a title.</string>
  <string id="6076220">I could go into business for myself. You must have pointers on that. Don't you, Varric?</string>
  <string id="6076221">I'd like to buy a business.</string>
  <string id="6076223">I'd like so many things: a fine stallion, a place in Hightown... and to know where Shadow is.</string>
  <string id="6076224">What a good question.</string>
  <string id="6076225">Laughs</string>
  <string id="6076228">Hawke, if I were going to invent stories about your personal life, they would probably involve the grand cleric.</string>
  <string id="6076229">Shows what you know. I would definitely bring this up just to gossip. I didn't. But I would.</string>
  <string id="6076230">Hawke, I know I'm damned near irresistible, but you're just too high-maintenance for me. Sorry.</string>
  <string id="6076231">It's the chest hair, isn't it? Women can never resist my chest hair. Unfortunately, it's not to be. I'm spoken for.</string>
  <string id="6076237">Ah, so you've noticed. I credit my high cheekbones and pouty lips.</string>
  <string id="6076238">There you are.</string>
  <string id="6076241">Carver?</string>
  <string id="6076244">Your family has convenient timing.</string>
  <string id="6076250">Uh-oh. Here we go.</string>
  <string id="6076253">I expected to find my brother under attack from the templars...</string>
  <string id="6076256">I expected to find my sister under attack from the templars...</string>
  <string id="6076259">But you're helping them.</string>
  <string id="6076262">Tell me this is a joke. You can't be siding with that bitch against your own people.</string>
  <string id="6076263">Why are you back in Kirkwall?</string>
  <string id="6076264">What are you doing here?</string>
  <string id="6076268">I thought you were fighting for your life! I came to help, but instead you're killing other mages!</string>
  <string id="6076269">Why does that bother you?</string>
  <string id="6076270">Just because I'm a mage doesn't mean I support everything they do.</string>
  <string id="6076271">They're not my people.</string>
  <string id="6076273">It's none of your business.</string>
  <string id="6076278">I'm trying to help the city before it's torn apart.</string>
  <string id="6076279">I'm restoring order.</string>
  <string id="6076280">Sighs</string>
  <string id="6076283">I didn't like how we left it in the Deep Roads. You saved my life, and I didn't even thank you.</string>
  <string id="6076286">Look, I don't agree with what you're doing... but if you need my help, I'll stand by you. Just say the word.</string>
  <string id="6076290">I've been looking everywhere for you. I thought you were dead.</string>
  <string id="6076291">Not a chance.</string>
  <string id="6076292">I'm not easy to kill.</string>
  <string id="6076293">Last time we spoke, it didn't seem like that would matter to you.</string>
  <string id="6076294">I'm surprised you care.</string>
  <string id="6076295">Here to cheer on the templars, are you?</string>
  <string id="6076296">Wanted to make sure?</string>
  <string id="6076297">Look, I know what happened in the Deep Roads. You saved my life, and I didn't even thank you.</string>
  <string id="6076300">But... you're the only family I have left. I have to stand by you. Just say the word and you'll have my blade.</string>
  <string id="6076301">I thought the Order was supposed to be neutral.</string>
  <string id="6076302">What about the Grey Wardens?</string>
  <string id="6076307">Your blade would be welcome.</string>
  <string id="6076308">I could use the help.</string>
  <string id="6076309">The Hawke brothers together again, huh? Just like old times.</string>
  <string id="6076312">I have all the help I need.</string>
  <string id="6076313">I don't need you.</string>
  <string id="6076314">I'm not about to let you die for me.</string>
  <string id="6076315">It's too dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6076319">This is a bad situation all around isn't it? If those mages kill you...</string>
  <string id="6076322">I hope the templars don't get away with this. If they kill you...</string>
  <string id="6076328">There you are!</string>
  <string id="6076331">Bethany?</string>
  <string id="6076334">Your sister shows up at the oddest times.</string>
  <string id="6076340">She's not going to be happy.</string>
  <string id="6076343">Here I was, expecting to find my brother fighting this madwoman who would slaughter every mage in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6076346">Here I was, expecting to find my sister fighting this madwoman who would slaughter every mage in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6076349">Instead, you're helping her?</string>
  <string id="6076352">Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me that my own family didn't side with the templars.</string>
  <string id="6076353">Why are you back in Kirkwall?</string>
  <string id="6076354">What are you doing here?</string>
  <string id="6076358">I thought you were going to be killed! I came to fight at your side, but instead I see you doing this!</string>
  <string id="6076359">Dropping by every few years doesn't mean you know what's going on.</string>
  <string id="6076360">You haven't been here.</string>
  <string id="6076362">It's none of your business.</string>
  <string id="6076367">I'm trying to help the city before it's torn apart.</string>
  <string id="6076368">I'm restoring order.</string>
  <string id="6076369">Sighs</string>
  <string id="6076372">I didn't like how we left it in the Deep Roads. You saved my life, and I didn't even thank you.</string>
  <string id="6076375">If you think supporting the templars is the right thing to do then... so do I. Just say the word, and I'll help you.</string>
  <string id="6076379">I've been looking everywhere for you. I thought you were dead.</string>
  <string id="6076380">Not a chance.</string>
  <string id="6076381">I'm not easy to kill.</string>
  <string id="6076382">Last time we spoke, it didn't seem like that would matter to you.</string>
  <string id="6076383">I'm surprised you care.</string>
  <string id="6076384">Here to cheer on the templars, are you?</string>
  <string id="6076385">Wanted to make sure?</string>
  <string id="6076386">I... wanted to apologize for what happened in the Deep Roads. You saved my life, and I couldn't even see that.</string>
  <string id="6076389">You're the only family I have left. If you need my help against the templars, just say the word.</string>
  <string id="6076390">I thought the Order was supposed to be neutral.</string>
  <string id="6076391">What about the Grey Wardens?</string>
  <string id="6076392">Right now, I'm not a Grey Warden. I'm your sister.</string>
  <string id="6076395">I blamed you for putting me in the Order, but you did it to help me. I was wrong.</string>
  <string id="6076396">Your magic would be welcome.</string>
  <string id="6076397">I could use the help.</string>
  <string id="6076398">The Hawke sisters together again, just like old times.</string>
  <string id="6076401">I have all the help I need.</string>
  <string id="6076402">I don't need you.</string>
  <string id="6076403">I'm not about to let you die for me.</string>
  <string id="6076404">It's too dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6076405">Sighs I thought you might say that.</string>
  <string id="6076408">I'll go, but if you don't make it... I swear I'll avenge you.</string>
  <string id="6076414">Good luck, Sister.</string>
  <string id="6076417">Oh, indeed I am! But technically I imagine everyone here can rightfully claim that title.</string>
  <string id="6076418">Leave Area</string>
  <string id="6076424">You'd think after three years the dwarf would learn my name. And I'm standing right here!</string>
  <string id="6076427">Right, I see you there, Blondie. Don't worry.</string>
  <string id="6076432">The angsty one?</string>
  <string id="6076435">Hey, I also got Tevinter in there. Don't leave that out.</string>
  <string id="6076440">Feeling left out, are we, Varric? If you wanted to join in, all you had to do was ask.</string>
  <string id="6076443">Isabela, you know my heart is already spoken for.</string>
  <string id="6076446">Your heart might belong to Bianca, but I think your trousers might be up for grabs.</string>
  <string id="6076449">Great. It's going to take all day to get that image out of my head.</string>
  <string id="6076454">For the hundredth time, my name is not Daisy! And I'm right here, you oaf!</string>
  <string id="6076457">You're just encouraging him, you know. He's doing it on purpose to make you squirm.</string>
  <string id="6076460">It's true. I only do it because I love the way the points of your ears turn red when you get mad.</string>
  <string id="6076463">So, what's going on, Hawke?</string>
  <string id="6076471">I meant Lowtown. Dirty, chaotic, glorious Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6076474">The house is fine, I suppose, but Lowtown...</string>
  <string id="6076477">The smell of tar and the sea, and the sound of some whore plying her trade in a back alley—don't you miss that?</string>
  <string id="6076478">Bad smells and awful noises. Why would I miss that?</string>
  <string id="6076479">No.</string>
  <string id="6076480">Because it adds character to a place, you goose.</string>
  <string id="6076483">You can get your thrills in Hightown, if you know where to look.</string>
  <string id="6076484">There's excitement right here.</string>
  <string id="6076485">Just a little bit.  Hightown can be a little dull.</string>
  <string id="6076486">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6076487">Hightown's nice enough, I suppose, for people who like clean streets and polite neighbors.</string>
  <string id="6076490">I thought you were different. Wilder, more dangerous. Someone worthy of... a duel.</string>
  <string id="6076491">I'll give you a duel, but you might regret it.</string>
  <string id="6076492">You're asking for trouble.</string>
  <string id="6076494">Your loss. Let me know how the buttoned-up, strait-laced women of Hightown work out for you.</string>
  <string id="6076497">You're very compliant for a fugitive.</string>
  <string id="6076498">You'll come without a fight?</string>
  <string id="6076499">Compliant, yes, and very bendy.</string>
  <string id="6076502">Ah, as wise as you are breathtaking. You remind me of... a very dear friend. </string>
  <string id="6076507">But truthfully? I know when I am outmatched. I would rather take my chances against the Crows.</string>
  <string id="6076516">Bianca stands in my way again, does she?</string>
  <string id="6076519">What can I say? She's the jealous type.</string>
  <string id="6076530">I know you don't listen to a damned thing I say, but you might want to be careful.</string>
  <string id="6076531">Listen, as your friend, I feel like I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't say something.</string>
  <string id="6076539">Maybe, just maybe, getting involved with the possessed mage might be dangerous. There: I've said my piece.</string>
  <string id="6076540">You do know the elf is covered in spikes, like an angsty porcupine? He might have some... issues.</string>
  <string id="6076541">Isabela is a great girl, but I think you're likely to get hurt. By which I mean stabbed and left for dead.</string>
  <string id="6076542">Merrill is a sweet girl, but there's a whole lot of crazy in that little package.</string>
  <string id="6076546">You know him best. What do you think?</string>
  <string id="6076547">Your opinion, Isabela?</string>
  <string id="6076548">I've had better.</string>
  <string id="6076551">I meant about letting him go or not.</string>
  <string id="6076554">Oh. Right. I'd let him go.</string>
  <string id="6076564">You look good enough to eat.</string>
  <string id="6076567">We're done talking about this.</string>
  <string id="6076568">Drop it.</string>
  <string id="6076569">I know you mean well, Varric. Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.</string>
  <string id="6076570">I appreciate your concern.</string>
  <string id="6076571">In all the time you've known me, have I ever given you the impression that I was turned off by crazy?</string>
  <string id="6076572">That sounds perfect for me.</string>
  <string id="6076573">Slayer of Qunari, Deep Roads explorer, and a beauty to make the gods jealous? You underestimate your fame!</string>
  <string id="6076574">Right. Sorry I brought it up.</string>
  <string id="6076577">I certainly hope so.</string>
  <string id="6076580">Laughs Okay, point taken.</string>
  <string id="6076589">No plans yet. I'm simply trying to look out for my mother.</string>
  <string id="6076590">Just taking care of my family.</string>
  <string id="6076591">Oh? And where would that be?</string>
  <string id="6076601">I should go. That was an... interesting diversion.</string>
  <string id="6076602">I don't want you wandering the streets alone at this hour.</string>
  <string id="6076603">You should stay.</string>
  <string id="6076604">Giggles You're sweet, but I can watch out for myself.</string>
  <string id="6076616">Is that all I am to you? Oh, my wounded heart!</string>
  <string id="6076617">I'm just a diversion?</string>
  <string id="6076618">Ha! We were using each other, sweet thing. I was curious about you, and now my curiosity is... sated.</string>
  <string id="6076622">I'm not done with you.</string>
  <string id="6076623">That's it?</string>
  <string id="6076624">But they did nothing about it, no matter what we said. So my brothers and I paid him a visit.</string>
  <string id="6076627">I thought you'd be taller.</string>
  <string id="6076628">You're not what I expected.</string>
  <string id="6076629">I'll help you.</string>
  <string id="6076630">I'll help you.</string>
  <string id="6076631">I'll help you.</string>
  <string id="6076632">You have one chance and one chance only to prove yourself, apostate. Do not test me.</string>
  <string id="6076645">Love's the first step to heartbreak. I'd like to stay away from it.</string>
  <string id="6076646">I was naive when last we met. I did not want you dead, but I felt a death was necessary.</string>
  <string id="6076651">I cannot believe the Qunari would dare such an attack. This will lead to war with the Free Marches for certain.</string>
  <string id="6076656">Grand Cleric Elthina cannot grant an audience to just anyone. What do you want?</string>
  <string id="6076665">I know you, and I know someone is abusing the grand cleric's seal.</string>
  <string id="6076666">You set me up years ago.</string>
  <string id="6076667">A templar may have misjudged an order and abused the grand cleric's authority.</string>
  <string id="6076668">Elthina's seal was misused.</string>
  <string id="6076671">Now, if you're done trying to confuse the issue, I'm going to go.</string>
  <string id="6076674">Come see me at the tavern sometime. I know a cozy little nook behind the ale barrels.</string>
  <string id="6076680">A Qunari delegate has disappeared. She may have ordered it.</string>
  <string id="6076681">Her grace inspired a kidnapping.</string>
  <string id="6076682">That is a quite an accusation. Ridiculous, of course. She leads a great many people, but not as a commander.</string>
  <string id="6076685">A templar used her seal to convince others the act was righteous.</string>
  <string id="6076707">He is my former bodyguard, Ser Varnell. Assume what you wish, but I offer him to you as... reconciliation.</string>
  <string id="6076717">I am thoroughly disappointed. No one fails the Crows and lives.</string>
  <string id="6076724">Who are you to question who serves Her Grace? I am sorry, but I see no reason to let you pass.</string>
  <string id="6076727">My being a Crow has nothing to do with you not finishing your mission.</string>
  <string id="6076730">You're nothing but a traitor and a coward, Zevran. You'll die here!</string>
  <string id="6076733">Brother and sister together again, huh? Just like old times.</string>
  <string id="6076734">Brother and sister together again, just like old times.</string>
  <string id="6076735">I guess I can't blame you for saying that.</string>
  <string id="6076738">Good luck, Brother.</string>
  <string id="6076742">I assure you, the templars would never embarrass the Chantry, at risk of the knight-commander's wrath.</string>
  <string id="6076748">Men were hired for the righteous task of kidnapping a Qunari delegate.</string>
  <string id="6076778">Guard</string>
  <string id="6076780">When I'm done, they'll have to send Nuncio and his men back to Antiva in a wine cask. </string>
  <string id="6076781">Because they're idiots.</string>
  <string id="6076782">Why didn't you go when you had the chance?</string>
  <string id="6076783">Zevran, I thought you'd left.</string>
  <string id="6076784">And risk a beauty such as yours be marred by a Crow dagger? Never!</string>
  <string id="6076785">To see the Champion of Kirkwall in action? You couldn't keep me away!</string>
  <string id="6076786">Keep away from me! I'm warning you!</string>
  <string id="6076791">Kill it! Kill it now!</string>
  <string id="6076798">Is there something you need? Perhaps I can help?</string>
  <string id="6076801">Did you need something?</string>
  <string id="6076802">Concerned Commoner</string>
  <string id="6076806">You know she's baiting us, right?</string>
  <string id="6076807">I invite you, Serah Hawke, to walk into a trap.</string>
  <string id="6076808">That's a set-up.</string>
  <string id="6076809">Need I say I am skeptical?</string>
  <string id="6076810">She is a poor conspirator.</string>
  <string id="6076811">Is there something she's not telling us?</string>
  <string id="6076812">As trustworthy as ever, I'm sure.</string>
  <string id="6076828">I hear there is a criminal hiding among the Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6076829">I'm here for the Antivan.</string>
  <string id="6076843">The templar you seek is a radical who has grown... unreliable. Confronting him may do us all a favor.</string>
  <string id="6076844">Meet me at this location. I invite you, Serah Hawke. Come see the unrest these Qunari have inspired.</string>
  <string id="6076854">Stop right there.</string>
  <string id="6076857">I wonder just how thankful the knight-commander would be if we brought her the Champion's head.</string>
  <string id="6076858">Let's see how that works out for you.</string>
  <string id="6076859">Just try it.</string>
  <string id="6076860">You really think Meredith will just let you walk away?</string>
  <string id="6076861">She's trying to kill you all.</string>
  <string id="6076862">What other choice do we have? Run? Hide?</string>
  <string id="6076863">Yes, I see it now: I'll let you apostates live, no questions asked!</string>
  <string id="6076864">You can't be that naive.</string>
  <string id="6076865">We're not apostates, or at least we weren't until your friend killed the grand cleric!</string>
  <string id="6076868">I'm sorry, Champion. Fighting the templars is a surer death sentence than fighting you.</string>
  <string id="6076870">He is not among us. This criminal of yours is set up in a cave away from our camp.</string>
  <string id="6076871">I thought the point of hiding was not to be found.</string>
  <string id="6076872">He's not very good at this.</string>
  <string id="6076877">You own a half stake in a mine, and you think you're somebody, huh?</string>
  <string id="6076880">Some Fereldans don't have the courtesy of knowing when to bloody die.</string>
  <string id="6076886">And his relation to you is...?</string>
  <string id="6076890">It's her game, for the moment.</string>
  <string id="6076895">You did this.</string>
  <string id="6076898">You stopped us from overthrowing that bitch while we still had the chance. Now look what she's done.</string>
  <string id="6076899">She has a responsibility to protect this city. And so do I.</string>
  <string id="6076900">Meredith is right.</string>
  <string id="6076901">You're both destroying this city! You're making a mockery of everything we stand for!</string>
  <string id="6076904">I didn't start that fight. You forced my hand.</string>
  <string id="6076905">You came after me.</string>
  <string id="6076906">We knew you would pick her side, just like you're doing now!</string>
  <string id="6076909">You came here to complain about it?</string>
  <string id="6076910">So what are you going to do?</string>
  <string id="6076911">We came here to stop you. Or die trying.</string>
  <string id="6076916">My dear Isabela, it has been a delight to see you again. You travel in fine company.</string>
  <string id="6076919">That's it? You're leaving? What about sex?</string>
  <string id="6076922">Laughs Still blunt as a dwarven hammer, hmm? Well, why not!</string>
  <string id="6076925">What? You can come too.</string>
  <string id="6076930">Indeed! The more the merrier!</string>
  <string id="6076931">Let's find someplace quieter.</string>
  <string id="6076932">All right, I'm game.</string>
  <string id="6076934">I'm not interested.</string>
  <string id="6076935">No thanks.</string>
  <string id="6076936">Of course. Isabela?</string>
  <string id="6076937">I don't want you to do this.</string>
  <string id="6076938">Isabela, don't.</string>
  <string id="6076944">Yes, invigorating, isn't it? You are of course welcome to join us, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6076945">Ah, Isabela. I did so miss you.</string>
  <string id="6076948">I think I just threw up a little in my mouth.</string>
  <string id="6076953">Ha.</string>
  <string id="6076956">That girl has curious standards.</string>
  <string id="6076959">Ew.</string>
  <string id="6076966">Love? We were rutting. It has nothing to do with love.</string>
  <string id="6076969">You're not afraid of being hurt, you're just afraid of hurting someone else.</string>
  <string id="6076970">You're afraid of being loved.</string>
  <string id="6076988">Are we sure he was part of a guild of assassins?</string>
  <string id="6076992">Lowtown</string>
  <string id="6077006">Nice place for a rally. Good choice, Varnell.</string>
  <string id="6077007">So. Looking for a room full of armed zealots.</string>
  <string id="6077008">Have to hand it to this Varnell. Nice place for an extremist rally.</string>
  <string id="6077009">Easy place to get cornered.</string>
  <string id="6077010">Tight quarters.</string>
  <string id="6077011">Not liking the look of this.</string>
  <string id="6077012">Nice place for a rally. And where are you, Petrice?</string>
  <string id="6077013">Step away, Guardsman. The knight-commander has issued her decree.</string>
  <string id="6077016">You can't do this! My uncle's in the Circle! He's a good man, a servant of the Maker!</string>
  <string id="6077019">If he is a mage, he is subject to the temptations of all mages.</string>
  <string id="6077022">We won't let you slaughter us like sheep!</string>
  <string id="6077034">What is going on here? You men have your orders!</string>
  <string id="6077037">But Captain!</string>
  <string id="6077040">We have a greater responsibility. Do as you are commanded!</string>
  <string id="6077046">Captain! They told us you were dead!</string>
  <string id="6077049">Wishful thinking. Stand your ground. The Circle will not fall today.</string>
  <string id="6077052">To arms!</string>
  <string id="6077058">It's the Champion! No!</string>
  <string id="6077059">Aveline told you men to help the templars, and that's what you will do.</string>
  <string id="6077060">You have your orders.</string>
  <string id="6077061">Please! Don't do this!</string>
  <string id="6077064">We swore to protect Kirkwall, even if we must fight the templars themselves.</string>
  <string id="6077065">Draw your sword if you intend to protect them.</string>
  <string id="6077066">Die with the mages.</string>
  <string id="6077067">I will not let you do this!</string>
  <string id="6077070">Do not get involved. Run, and don't come back.</string>
  <string id="6077071">Get out of our way.</string>
  <string id="6077072">I... I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6077078">You think you're so valiant, killing us?</string>
  <string id="6077081">Get on with it, then. Kill us! Do it!</string>
  <string id="6077087">It's the Champion! To arms, men!</string>
  <string id="6077090">Run for your lives!</string>
  <string id="6077099">I... can't believe this is happening.</string>
  <string id="6077105">Thank you, Champion. Come, men. There is more to be done.</string>
  <string id="6077111">Thank the Maker you came when you did.</string>
  <string id="6077114">We've got to get to the Gallows! Come on!</string>
  <string id="6077130">Petrice is here somewhere.</string>
  <string id="6077133">Wonderful.</string>
  <string id="6077134">Looking forward to it.</string>
  <string id="6077135">That's great.</string>
  <string id="6077136">Ugh.</string>
  <string id="6077137">Right.</string>
  <string id="6077138">Lovely.</string>
  <string id="6077143">Throw scraps to a dog, and you encourage him to beg for more. I run a business, not a kennel!</string>
  <string id="6077148">Do not fear them! They die, like any animal!</string>
  <string id="6077154">Qunari hold no real power. They are absent from the eyes of the Maker!</string>
  <string id="6077160">Nathaniel must determine his own fate down in the Deep Roads.</string>
  <string id="6077167">I will hire new hands. Plenty of desperate Fereldans out there, but it will take some time.</string>
  <string id="6077170">I need you to convince the surviving miners to return. They are holed up in Lowtown. Tell them the Bone Pit is safe again.</string>
  <string id="6077187">They are weak before the faithful of the Maker. The only certainty in their precious Qun is death before the righteous.</string>
  <string id="6077191">Now that I would pay to see.</string>
  <string id="6077192">It's a pity, the Crows could really benefit from having you in their pocket. Alas, orders are orders. No loose ends.</string>
  <string id="6077200">Isabela said she would meet Hayder in Hightown after dark.</string>
  <string id="6077229">Ser Varnell!</string>
  <string id="6077230">Well, he wasn't. Go there and see the corpses for yourself.</string>
  <string id="6077241">Take a knee, faithful. The Chantry blesses us.</string>
  <string id="6077244">You claim a blessing when you have used the authority of the grand cleric so openly?</string>
  <string id="6077255">The Chantry</string>
  <string id="6077257">Lowtown</string>
  <string id="6077259">I would say, I told you so, but that would be so expected, no?</string>
  <string id="6077268">You have brought wrath down upon you. You remember Serah Hawke?</string>
  <string id="6077274">The Qunari have friends, templar. How will you answer their allegations?</string>
  <string id="6077275">You want a fight! Face someone whose weapons are not bound!</string>
  <string id="6077276">Varnell and the others die.</string>
  <string id="6077277">Righteous!</string>
  <string id="6077280">Destroy them!</string>
  <string id="6077284">The Bone Pit must be dangerous if people are afraid to venture there.</string>
  <string id="6077285">Nobody will go?</string>
  <string id="6077286">No, nothing like that. Pay no heed to local superstition. The Bone Pit is mostly harmless.</string>
  <string id="6077297">You can say what you mean, Isabela. We're friends.</string>
  <string id="6077298">A duel?</string>
  <string id="6077303">I'm just as wild and dangerous as I was back in Lowtown. I just sleep on cleaner sheets now.</string>
  <string id="6077304">Hey, I'm still worthy.</string>
  <string id="6077305">If that's not a challenge, I don't know what is.</string>
  <string id="6077312">Petrice!</string>
  <string id="6077315">Hello, Mother Petrice.</string>
  <string id="6077318">Miss me?</string>
  <string id="6077321">Serah Hawke, it is good to see you. The shame that Varnell brought his order is most unfortunate.</string>
  <string id="6077324">Praise the Maker that you were His Champion in that dark place.</string>
  <string id="6077325">No thanks to you, and you know it!</string>
  <string id="6077326">You almost got me killed!</string>
  <string id="6077327">You knew exactly what was going to happen in there.</string>
  <string id="6077328">Somehow, I doubt you mean that.</string>
  <string id="6077329">Look, we're both adults here. Can we drop the pretense?</string>
  <string id="6077330">Stop the lying.</string>
  <string id="6077331">Try me.</string>
  <string id="6077335">Don't say I didn't warn you.</string>
  <string id="6077336">Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6077337">That's not a good idea.</string>
  <string id="6077338">I'd rather not.</string>
  <string id="6077341">I gave you Varnell.</string>
  <string id="6077344">And a room full of zealots.</string>
  <string id="6077347">He recruited with the promise of Chantry blessing. You weren't going to argue them out of salvation.</string>
  <string id="6077348">Hawke, you are standing between the righteous and the heretical. You're not going to make friends.</string>
  <string id="6077351">I'd settle for being able to trust the people I already know.</string>
  <string id="6077355">I think you'll find that I have said nothing threatening or untruthful.</string>
  <string id="6077358">You and your careful language.</string>
  <string id="6077361">I gave you what you wanted at considerable cost. Varnell is more manageable as a martyr, but his loss will be felt.</string>
  <string id="6077367">You have avenged heretical Qunari with human blood. Surely that is good enough for you?</string>

  <string id="6077736">I... yes. Yes, I've made up my mind.</string>
  <string id="6077737">Ma serannas. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6077738">Of course. I can wait.</string>
  <string id="6077752">I can't do what I have to do alone. This is probably for the best.</string>
  <string id="6077755">There's no going back to the Keeper now, anyway.</string>
  <string id="6077757">I've heard about you. You helped the Hero of Ferelden stop the Blight.</string>
  <string id="6077760">At your service, my friend!</string>
  <string id="6077774">City Guardsman</string>
  <string id="6077782">Gallows Courtyard</string>
  <string id="6077787">Ah. I'd wondered if the dragons left their nest unguarded.</string>
  <string id="6077790">Another dragon, and larger? Not a threat we should leave behind.</string>
  <string id="6077793">Sage advice from a miner. Still, I think we should finish off that last dragon.</string>
  <string id="6077796">Seems we've another dragon to slay. Here I was hoping to get back to Kirkwall in time for happy hour...</string>
  <string id="6077799">We're not done yet. One more dragon to kill.</string>
  <string id="6077802">I do not relish the thought of fighting a dragon larger than those in here.</string>
  <string id="6077808">There's the entrance to the mines. Perhaps we'll find the missing workers within.</string>
  <string id="6077809">An entrance to the mines. Hubert mentioned some of his workers may have gotten lost there.</string>
  <string id="6077810">We going into those mines?</string>
  <string id="6077812">The looters seem to be staying away from this mine entrance. Maybe they know something we don't.</string>
  <string id="6077813">Generations of slaves died in that mine. I can still feel their cries for justice.</string>
  <string id="6077818">I suppose after the whole business with Carver, it's a good idea to hang on to what you've got.</string>
  <string id="6077819">After everything that happened with Bethany, that's probably good thinking.</string>
  <string id="6077822">I always thought you had the soul of a politician, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6077823">Really? Politics? That's either idealism or crazy talking, so... right up your alley, I'd say.</string>
  <string id="6077824">If anyone could handle a life of sitting on their butt all day eating bonbons, Hawke, it's you.</string>
  <string id="6077825">I wouldn't wish that on you, my friend. Nobility is just another word for, A lot of rich people trying to kill you.</string>
  <string id="6077826">I could sell you the Tethras family businesses! It's great—sort of like being married to the entire Merchant Guild.</string>
  <string id="6077827">A business is like a puppy: take your eyes off it, and soon there's shit all over your floor.</string>
  <string id="6077835">There's a foul wind coming from that cavern. I smell death.</string>
  <string id="6077839">Only half eaten. The dragons must be saving some for later.</string>
  <string id="6077840">However much Hubert pays the miners, it's not enough.</string>
  <string id="6077841">The dragons didn't kill these miners just to feed on them. Something incited them.</string>
  <string id="6077842">It's not a mine. It's a larder.</string>
  <string id="6077843">The dragons have killed so many. I'm afraid we won't find anyone left.</string>
  <string id="6077844">Let me ask you something, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6077849">Varnell stepped too far, but the faithful know that eternity is at stake.</string>
  <string id="6077852">Though there are, perhaps, better ways to go about it.</string>
  <string id="6077854">Crazed Woman</string>
  <string id="6077879">Anyway, I'll stop babbling now. Thanks for hearing me out, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6077880">I can't let this go that easy.</string>
  <string id="6077881">I'm not done with you.</string>
  <string id="6077893">I hope you live a long life, Serah Hawke, because your judgment before the Maker will be harsh.</string>
  <string id="6077911">Love is a messy business.</string>
  <string id="6077912"> Maybe you're right.</string>
  <string id="6077916">This life suits me. I'm free. It's easier this way.</string>

  <string id="6077950">What are you up to?</string>
  <string id="6077952">Did you know I was once married? When I was freed, I swore I would never marry again.</string>

  <string id="6077976">The viscount's incompetence all but guarantees it.</string>
  <string id="6077983">You surprise me, Serah Hawke. It is... wonderful to see that others understand the true threat of the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6077986">They are such an insult to the Maker, we are justified any action when the stakes involve eternity at His side.</string>
  <string id="6077987">Don't go making a mess like Varnell. Rash action will risk everything.</string>
  <string id="6077988">Just lay low for a while.</string>

  <string id="6078169">So, you could not rescue my delegate, but you killed those responsible.</string>
  <string id="6078174">So, human. My delegate was taken from the viscount's doorstep. And he still claims control of this city.</string>

  <string id="6078475">Panahedan, Hawke. I will keep one good thought about your kind.</string>
  <string id="6078497">The lyrium idol ended up in Meredith's hands, and she had it turned into a powerful sword that has seemingly driven her insane. She must be defeated.</string>
  <string id="6078522">Have you heard the stories they're telling about you, lately?</string>
  <string id="6078523">It can happen, and when it does, the clan must hunt and kill their own Keeper.</string>
  <string id="6078529">You have got to hear this, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6078534">Leave that alone! There are things in my life that don't actually involve you, you know. Stay out of my business, girl.</string>
  <string id="6078544">Oh, they know. Keeper Marethari told me that was one of the reasons we never camped too long in one place.</string>
  <string id="6078547">They usually won't pursue us if we stay away from cities and towns and keep moving.</string>
  <string id="6078550">But my clan is now in more danger, having lost our halla.</string>
  <string id="6078557">Jump to a location</string>
  <string id="6078558">Jump to a location</string>
  <string id="6078559">Select an act</string>
  <string id="6078560">Act 1</string>
  <string id="6078561">Act 1</string>
  <string id="6078565">I've done a little fighting before, but it was always alone.</string>
  <string id="6078566">Back</string>
  <string id="6078567">Back</string>
  <string id="6078572">Select a location:</string>
  <string id="6078573">Hight Town Market</string>
  <string id="6078574">Hight Town Market</string>

  <string id="6078579">Back</string>
  <string id="6078580">Back</string>
  <string id="6078593">We have talked enough. You will not be leaving this place.</string>
  <string id="6078602">I'll try not to hit anyone. On our side, I mean. I'm babbling again. Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6078605">Danarius's Manor</string>
  <string id="6078611">Guard</string>
  <string id="6078616">Raiders on the Cliffs</string>
  <string id="6078623">Help the guards assault the raider base.</string>
  <string id="6078624">Harley is surrounded. Clear out the hideout while she hangs back.</string>
  <string id="6078656">There's this tale making the rounds...</string>
  <string id="6078659">They say a Tevinter mage was animating corpses in the city, and you beat him down with your bare hands.</string>
  <string id="6078675">They're saying you single-handedly fought off a pirate invasion, at midnight, on the sacred ground of the chantry.</string>
  <string id="6078676">They say you and that old coot Solivitus have gone into business together... making love potions?</string>
  <string id="6078685">They say you and the Qunari leader get together every week to play Wicked Grace, and you're up by ten sovereigns.</string>
  <string id="6078688">Hurlock Emissary</string>
  <string id="6078701">This sounds like something you would say, Varric.</string>
  <string id="6078702">They say?</string>
  <string id="6078703">Me? I'm hurt you think I'd spread such a half-spun tale.</string>
  <string id="6078704">Strange that people would get such an idea out of the blue.</string>
  <string id="6078705">Where did you hear that?</string>
  <string id="6078706">I may have... embellished a detail or two here and there. A little.</string>
  <string id="6078707">Don't the stories mention my stunning good looks? What about my cunning wit?</string>
  <string id="6078708">Is that all?</string>
  <string id="6078709">No, they skip straight to the part about the loveable dwarf with the gorgeous crossbow and the heart of gold.</string>
  <string id="6078713">Stay back! I don't want to fight you!</string>
  <string id="6078717">Speak, if you have something to say.</string>
  <string id="6078720">Revoke the Right of Annulment, Meredith, before this goes too far.</string>
  <string id="6078723">Imprison us, if you must. Search the tower. I will even help you.</string>
  <string id="6078726">But do not kill us all for an act we did not commit.</string>
  <string id="6078729">The grand cleric is dead, killed by a mage. The people will demand retribution, and I will give it to them.</string>
  <string id="6078735">Your offer is commendable, Orsino, but it comes too late.</string>
  <string id="6078740">The time for talking is done.</string>
  <string id="6078741">Time to end this.</string>
  <string id="6078742">Evidently so.</string>
  <string id="6078745">I agree.</string>
  <string id="6078748">We can still prevent this, before you both tear Kirkwall apart.</string>
  <string id="6078749">It's not too late.</string>
  <string id="6078750">You heard her. She's wanted this all along.</string>
  <string id="6078753">It is already torn apart. We cannot divert from our path.</string>
  <string id="6078756">I was kind of hoping for a happy ending.</string>
  <string id="6078757">Too bad.</string>
  <string id="6078758">I doubt we'll be seeing that.</string>
  <string id="6078778">That seems unlikely.</string>
  <string id="6078790">So your organization is behind this?</string>
  <string id="6078791">They're attacking me?</string>
  <string id="6078792">We got explicit orders not to. Hubert's been good on his payments.</string>
  <string id="6078795">If Brekker ordered this, the rest of his life will be very short and painful.</string>
  <string id="6078796">Tell me about this man.</string>
  <string id="6078797">Who is Brekker?</string>
  <string id="6078798">He operates out of the south side. Always had more balls then sense.</string>
  <string id="6078801">His lackeys are loyal. Brekker must be involved.</string>
  <string id="6078802">We have to stop these attacks once and for all.</string>
  <string id="6078803">We need to resolve this.</string>
  <string id="6078804">Whoever is behind this will pay. The next idiot will think twice before crossing me.</string>
  <string id="6078805">Let's send a message.</string>
  <string id="6078806">Oh, we will...</string>
  <string id="6078809">I know who to lean on to get answers. Find me in the Undercity.</string>
  <string id="6078815">I try to steer them straight, but you know how stories go.</string>
  <string id="6078816">First Enchanter!</string>
  <string id="6078819">First Enchanter.</string>
  <string id="6078848">I tell people how you arm wrestled a hundred-foot-tall golem in the Deep Roads.</string>
  <string id="6078851">And... added a few things that didn't happen. For pacing, you understand.</string>
  <string id="6078857">Let's pay Brekker a social call. We've got a lot to talk about.</string>
  <string id="6078858">Time to meet Brekker.</string>
  <string id="6078859">Understood.</string>
  <string id="6078862">You're one of us. The Coterie doesn't attack its own.</string>
  <string id="6078865">I've got to be sure, first.</string>
  <string id="6078868">Which negotiations setup would you like?</string>
  <string id="6078871">Exit</string>
  <string id="6078872">Exit</string>
  <string id="6078876">Harley is surrounded. Help Harley and her men clear out the hideout.</string>
  <string id="6078877">Harley is surrounded. Provide cover for Harley and her men while they escape.</string>
  <string id="6078878">Report back to Jalen at the Keep.</string>
  <string id="6078879">Report back to Jalen at the Keep.</string>
  <string id="6078880">Jalen was well-pleased and offered a reward.</string>
  <string id="6078967">Just... don't be surprised if people seem in awe.</string>
  <string id="6078976">It's like you haven't moved in three years.</string>
  <string id="6078979">It's easier for people to find me this way.</string>
  <string id="6078982">Still marinating your insides?</string>
  <string id="6078985">Have to keep old age at bay somehow.</string>
  <string id="6078988">Isabela. You look well.</string>
  <string id="6078991">Are you talking about the flush on my cheeks? It must be the whiskey.</string>
  <string id="6079013">Do you remember the relic I told you about? The one I need to find?</string>
  <string id="6079016">I've been following a lead. I'm so close, I can taste it!</string>
  <string id="6079017">The search for this thing has consumed you. Let it go.</string>
  <string id="6079018">You don't need it.</string>
  <string id="6079019">Isn't that what you said last time?</string>
  <string id="6079020">Are you sure?</string>
  <string id="6079021">Oh! You mean when I went digging for that stash?</string>
  <string id="6079024">Yes, that turned out to contain several badly written poems and an old boot.</string>
  <string id="6079027">It could've contained the relic!</string>
  <string id="6079030">You're wasting your time. Castillon probably doesn't care anymore.</string>
  <string id="6079031">Give it up.</string>
  <string id="6079032">I retrieved it! It would be mine if not for those rotten... storms.</string>
  <string id="6079038">I just thought I'd let you know that I may soon be taking you up on that offer of help.</string>
  <string id="6079039">Talk to me when the time comes.</string>
  <string id="6079040">We'll see.</string>
  <string id="6079041">Look, I know how you feel about this, but it's important to me, and I'm going to need your help when the time comes.</string>
  <string id="6079044">Just promise me you'll consider it.</string>
  <string id="6079045">If it means that much to you, you have my support.</string>
  <string id="6079046">I'm with you.</string>
  <string id="6079050">I like big boats, I cannot lie? Really, Isabela?</string>
  <string id="6079053">Well, I do! Blighted demon knew it too.</string>
  <string id="6079056">You have a lot to answer for.</string>
  <string id="6079059">We need to talk.</string>
  <string id="6079062">Groans Bugger. I knew this was coming.</string>
  <string id="6079065">Sighs I'm sorry I abandoned you in the Fade. That was foolish of me. I mean, I didn't even get the ship in the end.</string>
  <string id="6079066">I don't blame you. I understand what it's like to be under the influence of a demon.</string>
  <string id="6079067">I forgive you.</string>
  <string id="6079068">So you admit it. You'll betray a friend for a ship.</string>
  <string id="6079069">You backstabber.</string>
  <string id="6079070">Hey! Not just any ship!</string>
  <string id="6079073">I could see the hard line of the hull, run my hands along the elegant curve of her prow... oh!</string>
  <string id="6079076">The demon was in my head. Nothing but the ship made sense.</string>
  <string id="6079077">I would have stood by you, Isabela. No matter what the demon offered.</string>
  <string id="6079078">I wouldn't have left you.</string>
  <string id="6079079">Oh, so now you're playing the guilt card. That's low.</string>
  <string id="6079082">Everything you say proves your weakness.</string>
  <string id="6079083">Pathetic excuses.</string>
  <string id="6079084">Well, we can't all be perfect like you. That would make the world too boring, wouldn't it?</string>
  <string id="6079087">You betrayed me for an imaginary boat. My feelings are hurt.</string>
  <string id="6079088">How could you do that to me?</string>
  <string id="6079089">I already said I was sorry. What more do you want? Would you like me to clean your privy for a month?</string>
  <string id="6079092">Shit, I really shouldn't have said that.</string>
  <string id="6079146">What are we waiting around for?</string>
  <string id="6079150">I'd hate to hear what you'd tell people if you didn't like me.</string>
  <string id="6079151">Thanks.</string>
  <string id="6079152">And exactly how many taverns have heard this particular story?</string>
  <string id="6079153">You've been busy.</string>
  <string id="6079154">I guess awe works. A little reverence wouldn't hurt, though.</string>
  <string id="6079155">You're too kind.</string>
  <string id="6079162">Qunari</string>
  <string id="6079260">Meredith</string>
  <string id="6079263">You can count on me.</string>
  <string id="6079264">I'll do what I can.</string>
  <string id="6079265">Thanks. I appreciate it.</string>
  <string id="6079268">Do I get a kiss from the feisty temptress when I present her with the hard-won prize?</string>
  <string id="6079269">I'll do it for a kiss.</string>
  <string id="6079270">If you want. I'll even let you choose where I plant it.  Chuckles</string>
  <string id="6079276">You... what? That's it? No angry rant?</string>
  <string id="6079279">You're not going soft on me, are you?</string>
  <string id="6079280">I'd never go soft on you, Isabela.</string>
  <string id="6079281">Never.</string>
  <string id="6079282">You cheeky bastard. Giggles</string>
  <string id="6079285">Are you trying to get me to jump into bed with you? Because it's working.</string>
  <string id="6079286">Friends forgive each other.</string>
  <string id="6079287">We're friends.</string>
  <string id="6079288">Now you're making my insides feel squishy. Oh, go away.</string>
  <string id="6079291">We could arrange a spanking instead.</string>
  <string id="6079292">You don't like it?</string>
  <string id="6079293">Oh, stop. You're going to make me want to betray you more often.</string>
  <string id="6079296">It's over. I don't want to dwell on it.</string>
  <string id="6079297">It's just not worth it.</string>
  <string id="6079298">Fair enough. I'm glad you understand though.</string>

  <string id="6079336">I assume there's a good reason you didn't tell me about the dragons.</string>
  <string id="6079337">Hubert, please explain.</string>
  <string id="6079338">In case you hadn't noticed, your dragon's dead. No need to thank me.</string>
  <string id="6079339">You're welcome, by the way.</string>
  <string id="6079340">Quit your shouting.</string>
  <string id="6079341">Shut up, all of you.</string>
  <string id="6079342">Yes, thank you Champion! I, for one, am both grateful and amazed...</string>
  <string id="6079346">And now you louts will join her.</string>
  <string id="6079350">You Coterie? One of Lilley's friends?</string>
  <string id="6079353">Lilley was one of ours. She was working for you, and now she's dead.</string>
  <string id="6079356">One of the scum that attacked my caravans worked for someone in the Coterie named Brekker.</string>
  <string id="6079359">Lilley said she'd look into it. I think Brekker had her killed.</string>
  <string id="6079362">What do you think? We're not some sewer rat gang, Fereldan. We don't feed on our own.</string>
  <string id="6079365">Lilley was helping you. Now I find you over her dead body.</string>
  <string id="6079562">You mean you weren't ready to jump into bed before?</string>
  <string id="6079563">I don't have to try.</string>
  <string id="6079564">Oh. Yes. Good point.</string>
  <string id="6079567">Sighs I'm far too predictable.</string>
  <string id="6079570">Don't be ridiculous.</string>
  <string id="6079571">Absolutely not.</string>
  <string id="6079577">They're saying that you and a band of pirates tried to burn the chantry down in the middle of the night.</string>
  <string id="6079578">They say you helped some crazy Tevinter refugee summon a demon in Hightown.</string>
  <string id="6079580">I hear that you're seeing some Qunari in Lowtown. Getting serious, even. Are wedding bells in the air, by any chance?</string>

&#13;
My name is Emeric. I am a templar investigating the disappearances of several women. You have quite a reputation for helping people, and I hope you can assist me. Please find me in the Gallows courtyard.&#13;
&#13;
Yours truly, &#13;
Emeric</string>
  <string id="6079590">Speak to Templar Emeric in the Gallows courtyard.</string>
  <string id="6079591">Break into Gascard DuPuis's Hightown estate after dark to see if there's evidence that links him to the disappearances.</string>
  <string id="6079648">That poor girl. Who do you suppose she was? We should see if there's anything here to identify her.</string>
  <string id="6079649">That never would have happened if they hadn't backed that poor girl into a corner. Do you think we can find out who she was?</string>
  <string id="6079650">That poor thing! What was her name? Where were they taking her?</string>
  <string id="6079651">Check if there's anything to identify the girl. Her family will want to know.</string>
  <string id="6079652">Let's see if they've got anything in writing. They weren't planning to sell the girl here.</string>
  <string id="6079653">Let's search this place. Maybe we can find out who that... thing used to be.</string>
  <string id="6079654">Those men were employed by Tevinter. Only they buy mages. We must find who sent them.</string>
  <string id="6079655">Let's look around. What else do you think they were hiding here?</string>
  <string id="6079658">Oh, that looks like the house special! Whiskey flavored with rat droppings!</string>
  <string id="6079664">How have you been?</string>
  <string id="6079667">You don't have to keep checking up on me. I'm fine.</string>
  <string id="6079668">Why do you keep coming here? You're better than this.</string>
  <string id="6079669">This place is beneath you.</string>
  <string id="6079670">I'm comfortable here, all right?</string>
  <string id="6079674">I'm just here for the rat-flavored whiskey.</string>
  <string id="6079675">I'm not checking up on you.</string>
  <string id="6079679">Sober up. We need to talk.</string>
  <string id="6079682">I'm sober. And no, we don't.</string>
  <string id="6079693">You're avoiding me. I've barely seen you for the last three years.</string>
  <string id="6079696">You don't need me. You're the Champion of Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6079730">Examine the vhenadahl, the Tree of the People, in the elven alienage.</string>
  <string id="6079778">Tell Emeric at the Gallows that Gascard is not guilty.</string>
  <string id="6079779">Find Emeric in an alley just outside Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6079780">Emeric was slain by a powerful creature of dark magic.</string>
  <string id="6079781">Tell Emeric at the Gallows that Gascard is dead.</string>
  <string id="6079782">Emeric</string>
  <string id="6079784">Gascard DuPuis</string>
  <string id="6079786">Bone Pit Pay</string>
  <string id="6079789">Right.</string>
  <string id="6079793">I'm tired of not being able to find you when I need you.</string>
  <string id="6079794">Why are you avoiding me?</string>
  <string id="6079796">What compels you to spin these ridiculous tales?</string>
  <string id="6079797">Why tell stories?</string>
  <string id="6079798">Wouldn't it make more sense for you to be the main character in these tall tales of yours?</string>
  <string id="6079799">Why am I the hero?</string>
  <string id="6079800">I find it hard to believe you're spreading these stories without getting something in return.</string>
  <string id="6079801">What do you get out of this?</string>
  <string id="6079890">Who is this man?</string>
  <string id="6079891">He's from Lothering?</string>
  <string id="6079945">I love the sound of my own voice. And I'm a compulsive liar.</string>
  <string id="6079948">Honestly, I don't know. It's just something I do.</string>
  <string id="6079949">Bullshit. You could've stormed the Keep and slaughtered all those Qunari if you had to.</string>
  <string id="6079952">You and Aveline. I mean, look at her—she's a woman-shaped battering ram.</string>
  <string id="6079958">There's power in stories, though. That's all history is: The best tales. The ones that last. Might as well be mine.</string>
  <string id="6079982">Moira</string>
  <string id="6080080">There's a recipe to a good hero, Hawke. It's like alchemy.</string>
  <string id="6080083">One part down-to-earth, one part selfless nobility, two parts crazy, and you season liberally with wild falsehoods.</string>
  <string id="6080086">You let that percolate through a good audience for a while, and when it's done, you've got your hero.</string>
  <string id="6080091">Are you the reinforcements? I thought the captain would send more.</string>
  <string id="6080092">That just shows what you know, Hawke. The stories are their own reward.</string>
  <string id="6080095">Serah Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6080097">What do you want, human?</string>
  <string id="6080102">Instead of beating the poor man, let's appeal to his better nature.</string>
  <string id="6080103">No need to get violent.</string>
  <string id="6080104">I can't control Hubert when he gets like this. You'd better talk.</string>
  <string id="6080105">No need to get violent.</string>
  <string id="6080106">He can't talk with a mouthful of broken teeth.</string>
  <string id="6080107">No need to get violent.</string>
  <string id="6080108">I wish I didn't have to do this, but lives are on the line.</string>
  <string id="6080109">Beat some sense into him.</string>
  <string id="6080110">You're too easy on him, Hubert. Don't pull your punches. Like this...</string>
  <string id="6080111">Beat some sense into him.</string>
  <string id="6080112">Hubert, you hit like an Orlesian courtesan. Watch and learn.</string>
  <string id="6080113">Beat some sense into him.</string>
  <string id="6080129">You really need to see the look on someone's face when I tell them you ripped the arms off an ogre. Just once.</string>
  <string id="6080134">I beg you, messere. Don't hit me again.</string>
  <string id="6080138">You're forcing my hand, Hawke. I didn't want it to come to this.</string>
  <string id="6080140">Join me.</string>
  <string id="6080141">Yes, you are. And you know it.</string>
  <string id="6080146">I have a duty to this city. I don't expect you to understand.</string>
  <string id="6080151">Chuckles Probably not.</string>
  <string id="6080154">Sighs You are so certain.</string>
  <string id="6080157">Captain Aveline, you have a duty to keep order.</string>
  <string id="6080160">Has it been served so far, Knight-Commander? I think not.</string>
  <string id="6080163">You made your choice.</string>
  <string id="6080164">Too bad.</string>
  <string id="6080165">Sorry, Aveline. This is how it has to be.</string>
  <string id="6080166">Neither did I.</string>
  <string id="6080167">I suppose so.</string>
  <string id="6080170">You realize this is a cause you cannot hope to win.</string>
  <string id="6080171">Is that all you want? To win?</string>
  <string id="6080172">Join me.</string>
  <string id="6080173">You will never understand what I want.</string>
  <string id="6080176">I thought freedom from slavery meant something to you.</string>
  <string id="6080177">Join me.</string>
  <string id="6080178">It does. That is why I oppose what these mages hope to become.</string>
  <string id="6080181">I suppose dying with you at my side is too much to ask?</string>
  <string id="6080182">Join me.</string>
  <string id="6080183">Yes. It is.</string>
  <string id="6080186">I...</string>
  <string id="6080189">I have changed my mind, human. I will stand with my friend.</string>
  <string id="6080192">As you wish. I did not ask for your assistance.</string>
  <string id="6080195">We'll see about that.</string>
  <string id="6080196">Neither can you.</string>
  <string id="6080197">Then I will meet you on the field of battle.</string>
  <string id="6080200">Sorry, Fenris. Some causes are worth fighting for.</string>
  <string id="6080201">I have to do this.</string>
  <string id="6080202">I agree.</string>
  <string id="6080205">And what about me? Are you really going to fight your own brother?</string>
  <string id="6080206">I could ask you the same question, Carver.</string>
  <string id="6080207">Are you?</string>
  <string id="6080208">You're the templar. You tell me.</string>
  <string id="6080209">Will you fight your sister?</string>
  <string id="6080210">This isn't what I want. I...</string>
  <string id="6080211">You've been itching to fight me for a long time.</string>
  <string id="6080212">Don't brother me.</string>
  <string id="6080213">You aren't leaving me much choice, Carver.</string>
  <string id="6080214">If I have to.</string>
  <string id="6080215">It's not like that. I just...</string>
  <string id="6080218">Ser Carver. I suggest you remember our purpose.</string>
  <string id="6080221">I— Yes, knight-commander.</string>
  <string id="6080224">I'm disappointed in you, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6080227">I suppose I should have expected no less from you, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6080230">So be it. You will share the Circle's fate.</string>
  <string id="6080233">Are you really going to kill these mages? And me with them?</string>
  <string id="6080235">Join me.</string>
  <string id="6080236">If only that were true.</string>
  <string id="6080241">I could be next, or any mage, or any elf. I must make a stand.</string>
  <string id="6080246">It is too late. For us all.</string>
  <string id="6080249">Maybe you're right.</string>
  <string id="6080252">You would abandon us? Your brothers and sisters in arms, your own people?</string>
  <string id="6080255">This is my friend. He is my people, now.</string>
  <string id="6080258">This is my friend. She is my people, now.</string>
  <string id="6080261">You made your choice, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6080262">Seems that way.</string>
  <string id="6080263">As have you.</string>
  <string id="6080266">I'm sorry, Merrill. This is how it has to be.</string>
  <string id="6080267">I have to do this.</string>
  <string id="6080268">Sadly, yes.</string>
  <string id="6080271">And me? Will you also fight your own sister?</string>
  <string id="6080272">You tell me.</string>
  <string id="6080273">Will you fight your brother?</string>
  <string id="6080274">I could ask you the same question, Bethany.</string>
  <string id="6080275">Will you?</string>
  <string id="6080276">You've made it clear that I mean nothing to you.</string>
  <string id="6080277">Don't sister me.</string>
  <string id="6080278">It's not like that! I...</string>
  <string id="6080281">You aren't leaving me much choice, Bethany.</string>
  <string id="6080282">I don't want to.</string>
  <string id="6080283">I didn't want it to come to this. I...</string>
  <string id="6080286">Stay strong, child. We must make a stand together, or we are all lost.</string>
  <string id="6080289">I... yes, First Enchanter.</string>
  <string id="6080292">So what is it to be, Meredith? Do we fight here?</string>
  <string id="6080298">Go, prepare your people. The rest of the Order is already crossing the harbor.</string>
  <string id="6080301">This isn't over!</string>
  <string id="6080361">If I didn't like you, I'd never mention you at all.</string>
  <string id="6080362">I only frequent the nice ones. Where it goes afterward is anybody's guess.</string>
  <string id="6080387">I'm here about the viscount's son.</string>
  <string id="6080390">Are you?</string>
  <string id="6080428">You may not be my best-dressed or cleanest friend, Master Hawke, but you're all right in my book.</string>
  <string id="6080434">In four years I have made no threat, and fanatics have lined up to hate us simply because we exist.</string>
  <string id="6080437">But despite lies and fear, bas still beg me to let them come to the Qun. They hunger for purpose.</string>
  <string id="6080440">The son has made a choice. You will not deny him that.</string>
  <string id="6080441">You're beautiful, deadly, and hang out with fantastic dwarves. It would be a crime if people didn't talk about you.</string>
  <string id="6080446">Sighs Remember what you said after the mess with the Qunari?</string>
  <string id="6080447">I'm proud of you for doing the right thing.</string>
  <string id="6080448">I'm glad you came back.</string>
  <string id="6080449">It may have been the right thing, but it was also the dumb thing. The relic was mine. I should've kept running.</string>
  <string id="6080450">I knew from the moment I met you that you couldn't be trusted.</string>
  <string id="6080451">I should've seen it coming.</string>
  <string id="6080452">You were to blame for the Qunari being here. For all the deaths.</string>
  <string id="6080453">It was your fault.</string>
  <string id="6080454">Anyway, I'll quit exaggerating before it goes to your head.</string>
  <string id="6080465">DEBUG - Click to advance Crit Path plot</string>
  <string id="6080474">You're biased; you need to replace your dwindling troops.</string>
  <string id="6080475">You just need reinforcements.</string>
  <string id="6080476">Only a fool arms a captive. Viddathari make a free and educated choice.</string>
  <string id="6080479">Join or die.</string>
  <string id="6080482">Lives are short compared to eternity. Death would be the obvious choice if there were any truth to your beliefs.</string>
  <string id="6080491">He went to his father. Ask the viscount why he would send you and a letter both.</string>
  <string id="6080492">That doesn't make sense.</string>
  <string id="6080493">Is this a trick?</string>
  <string id="6080494">They are meeting at the chantry. A last, pointless appeal, I assume.</string>
  <string id="6080508">No doubt you see the advantage of having the viscount's son at arm's reach.</string>
  <string id="6080509">An obvious political maneuver.</string>
  <string id="6080510">Converting the viscount's son... his opposition will have a field day.</string>
  <string id="6080511">Exactly what we need, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6080512">You have been given enough money to advance the Deep Roads Expedition plot.</string>
  <string id="6080515">Anders has been added to your party and he has given you maps revealing the location of the deep roads.</string>
  <string id="6080518">Fenris, Isabela and Merril have been added to your party (Carver/Bethany as well if you didn't play the prologue).</string>
  <string id="6080521">Background info: there is some conflict between mages and templars in the city.</string>
  <string id="6080524">Background info: there is some tension building up with the Qunari in the city. The Arishok is looking for a relic in the city.</string>
  <string id="6080529">Us Lothering folk should stick together.</string>
  <string id="6080530">I hid some gold in the Bone Pit. I'll mark it on your map. I regret stealing from someone like you, so please take it back.</string>
  <string id="6080537">The fact is... you and I have nothing in common anymore. You're a Champion, and I'm just a lying, thieving snake.</string>
  <string id="6080552">Hawke, this is Lilley of the Coterie. Given the importance of the stopping the cargo robberies, I have enlisted a... consultant.</string>
  <string id="6080555">Consultant? Sure. Whatever helps you sleep at night.</string>
  <string id="6080558">Want me to deal with this runt? Free of charge. I'll drop him in a ditch on our way out.</string>
  <string id="6080561">Yes, take him with my blessing! I assume my partner will not object...</string>
  <string id="6080562">Oh thank you, messeres! I know I don't deserve it, but thank you!</string>
  <string id="6080565">We're wasting time! If you find naught but corpses at the ambush, it won't be my fault.</string>
  <string id="6080568">My Fereldan brother gets a free pass. Let him go, and if I find out you harmed him...</string>
  <string id="6080569">We're letting Sabin go.</string>
  <string id="6080570">But... he! Oh, have it your way this once. But threatening your partner is no way to succeed in this business.</string>
  <string id="6080571">Sabin should pay for his crimes, but let's not sink to his level. Send him to prison.</string>
  <string id="6080572">Send him to prison.</string>
  <string id="6080573">I don't care what happens to him.</string>
  <string id="6080574">That's fine.</string>
  <string id="6080575">But... but, you said you would help me!</string>
  <string id="6080578">Well I lied, didn't I?</string>
  <string id="6080581">Sobs</string>
  <string id="6080582">Sabin is grateful for all your generosity, and his heart grieves that he must leave. Now!</string>
  <string id="6080590">Knight-Commander Meredith has been defeated.</string>
  <string id="6080591">Have you seen him?</string>
  <string id="6080594">Keran, was it? No. There are many templars in Kirkwall, woman.</string>
  <string id="6080603">Cries</string>
  <string id="6080606">Please, can you help me? My brother.</string>
  <string id="6080607">What happened to your brother?</string>
  <string id="6080608">Tell me what's wrong.</string>
  <string id="6080611">Keran was always so devout, so idealistic.</string>
  <string id="6080614">He was so proud when the templars accepted him. I pleaded with him not to join the Order, but he wouldn't listen.</string>
  <string id="6080617">You hear dark rumors about the templars and Knight-Commander Meredith. And now my brother is gone.</string>
  <string id="6080618">In Lothering, some templars died protecting villagers. I never heard any dark rumors.</string>
  <string id="6080619">Are templars so bad here?</string>
  <string id="6080620">And those are the stories my Keran adored. But it is not like that here, serah.</string>
  <string id="6080623">There is a growing darkness in the order. They prowl the streets in packs. Hunting.</string>
  <string id="6080626">And now, they say their duties put them above us, that they have the right to... take people from their homes. It is frightening.</string>
  <string id="6080627">What have you heard about the templars?</string>
  <string id="6080628">What rumors?</string>
  <string id="6080630">What do people say about Knight-Commander Meredith?</string>
  <string id="6080631">Tell me about Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6080632">Oh, she has many admirers. They laud the service she does in keeping the mages in check.</string>
  <string id="6080635">But others say she is terribly fierce and utterly without pity. That she sees demons everywhere.</string>
  <string id="6080641">It is dangerous even to whisper such things.</string>
  <string id="6080642">So you think the templars... what? Killed and ate your brother?</string>
  <string id="6080643">What are you saying?</string>
  <string id="6080644">Stop crying and tell me what you know.</string>
  <string id="6080645">Pull yourself together.</string>
  <string id="6080646">Yes, serah.</string>
  <string id="6080649">I'm here to help you. Just tell me what you know.</string>
  <string id="6080650">Tell me what happened.</string>
  <string id="6080654">Keran would write me every day. Then suddenly, no more letters. I wrote him many times with no response.</string>
  <string id="6080657">I tried to see him, but Knight-Commander Meredith threw me out. They won't tell me anything!</string>
  <string id="6080667">Your brother may indeed be in trouble. What can I do for you?</string>
  <string id="6080668">How can I help?</string>
  <string id="6080669">There are many urgent matters I must deal with. I must go.</string>
  <string id="6080670">I have things to attend to.</string>
  <string id="6080671">Please... I have no one else to ask.</string>
  <string id="6080674">I'd be putting myself at risk, possibly crossing the templars. Why should I do this for you?</string>
  <string id="6080675">What's in it for me?</string>
  <string id="6080676">I have precious little, but if you find my brother I will manage some way to pay you.</string>
  <string id="6080679">Perchance in your journeys if you find yourself in the Gallows—ask the other recruits, Wilmod and Hugh, about my brother.</string>
  <string id="6080682">They were Keran's closest friends in the Order. If anyone knows where he is, it's them.</string>
  <string id="6080685">Maker bless you and watch after you in this endeavor.</string>
  <string id="6080691">Do you know a recruit named Keran? His sister is looking for him.</string>
  <string id="6080696">Please find Wilmod. Find out what they're doing to the recruits.</string>
  <string id="6080699">We cannot speak to you, messere.</string>
  <string id="6080702">To the Void with that! Keran and the others are missing.</string>
  <string id="6080705">But our orders!</string>
  <string id="6080708">The knights aren't doing anything to find them. Maybe it's time to ask for outside help.</string>
  <string id="6080709">I wasn't even certain Keran was missing. Who else is gone?</string>
  <string id="6080710">There are others missing?</string>
  <string id="6080711">The first ones disappeared weeks ago. There's been at least half a dozen.</string>
  <string id="6080715">Why must you keep silent about Keran?</string>
  <string id="6080716">Why do you have to keep quiet?</string>
  <string id="6080717">You obviously aren't a templar, messere.</string>
  <string id="6080720">A knight-lieutenant gives you an order and you obey. Without question.</string>
  <string id="6080723">They told us not to breathe a word about Keran and the others.</string>
  <string id="6080729">They must have their reasons.</string>
  <string id="6080732">And that'll be a great comfort if you go missing next.</string>
  <string id="6080733">You can trust me. I'm only trying to keep Keran safe.</string>
  <string id="6080734">I want to help.</string>
  <string id="6080735">You're already defying orders to talk to me. Might as well share the good stuff.</string>
  <string id="6080736">You've come this far...</string>
  <string id="6080737">Out with it!</string>
  <string id="6080738">Answer me right now!</string>
  <string id="6080742">I hear that Knight-Commander Meredith has some new initiation you have to go through.</string>
  <string id="6080745">If you're not strong enough or fervent enough in belief, you don't make it out alive.</string>
  <string id="6080748">And you honestly believe that?</string>
  <string id="6080751">Recruits keep going missing.</string>
  <string id="6080754">Wilmod came back.</string>
  <string id="6080757">What?</string>
  <string id="6080760">He did. I saw him this morning.</string>
  <string id="6080761">What else do you know about the initiation?</string>
  <string id="6080762">Tell me about the initiation.</string>

  <string id="6080877">Bethany died</string>
  <string id="6080878">No</string>
  <string id="6080879">No</string>
  <string id="6080880">Templars</string>
  <string id="6080881">Templars</string>
  <string id="6080882">I did not make this choice yet.</string>
  <string id="6080883">I did not make this choice yet.</string>
  <string id="6080922">There're so many blood mages in Kirkwall. They do... unspeakable things.</string>
  <string id="6080923">In these trying times, the knight-commander is doing what she needs to to protect us.</string>
  <string id="6080924">The Order needs templars who are firm in their convictions.</string>
  <string id="6080973">I assume you are ready, Champion?</string>
  <string id="6080974">What will you do once the mages are dead?</string>
  <string id="6080975">What happens after this?</string>
  <string id="6080976">This is not the first time the Right of Annulment has ever been invoked. We will do as others have done before us: start again.</string>
  <string id="6080979">Kirkwall will be rebuilt, stronger than before. And the Circle will know fear.</string>
  <string id="6080982">This has been a long time coming. I am eager to begin.</string>
  <string id="6080983">Don't start yet.</string>
  <string id="6080984">Let's get this over with.</string>
  <string id="6080985">We're ready.</string>
  <string id="6080986">We're all set, Knight-Commander.</string>
  <string id="6080987">We're ready.</string>
  <string id="6080988">To slaughter the entire Circle? Oh, sure.</string>
  <string id="6080989">We're ready.</string>
  <string id="6080990">Good.</string>
  <string id="6080993">You will need to give orders to your companions. Do that, and the attack may begin.</string>
  <string id="6080996">I still need some more time.</string>
  <string id="6080997">Not yet.</string>
  <string id="6080998">Do what you must, but be quick. Orsino is undoubtedly making preparations of his own.</string>
  <string id="6081046">Pull through, Cordelia.</string>
  <string id="6081067">Pants</string>
  <string id="6081077">You might have better luck. Be careful.</string>
  <string id="6081086">Let me tell you what is about to happen.</string>
  <string id="6081089">We have the unenviable task of entering the Gallows and eliminating every mage we find within.</string>
  <string id="6081092">You must harden your heart. The magic within them is a disease that, if left unchecked, will spread and fester.</string>
  <string id="6081095">We will do what we must. Maker have mercy on their souls.</string>
  <string id="6081101">Prepare for the attack. Let me know when you are ready, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6081139">He hides. Only Booker knows where.</string>
  <string id="6081171">It doesn't matter. He chose the Qun in a time of peace. His life was not at risk. He is no prisoner.</string>
  <string id="6081175">Booker, you're just no good as a criminal—you need more finesse. Promise me you'll find another profession.</string>
  <string id="6081178">Find a new profession or I'll track you down. Understand?</string>
  <string id="6081181">This line of work will get you killed. I'm giving you a second chance—don't waste it.</string>
  <string id="6081189">I suppose you are right. Fine, I will turn this lout over to the guard. </string>
  <string id="6081192">You will rot in the dungeon for years, wishing all the while I had been kind enough to murder you.</string>
  <string id="6081201">Nervous, Hawke?</string>
  <string id="6081202">It's going to be a tough battle.</string>
  <string id="6081203">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6081204">I know we have to do this, but I don't want to lose people.</string>
  <string id="6081205">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6081206">My mother didn't raise any stupid children. I know how dangerous this fight will be.</string>
  <string id="6081207">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6081208">We've been in hundreds of battles. This is no different.</string>
  <string id="6081209">No.</string>
  <string id="6081210">There's nothing to be afraid of, Varric. We can handle this.</string>
  <string id="6081211">No.</string>
  <string id="6081212">The only part of this that worries me is: where are we going for the victory celebration? The Hanged Man was wrecked.</string>
  <string id="6081213">No.</string>
  <string id="6081234">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6081236">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6081246">Darkspawn can't talk. It's impossible.</string>
  <string id="6081247">How is it you can speak?</string>
  <string id="6081248">We talk, human, we think. The Architect has shown us how.</string>
  <string id="6081251">In time the whole of the surface world will know of us and tremble.</string>
  <string id="6081252">Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.</string>
  <string id="6081253">We don't have to fight.</string>
  <string id="6081254">Yeah, it is. I won't lie to you: This story of ours could end real badly.</string>
  <string id="6081255">But what a way to go! A heroic sacrifice for the good of Kirkwall? There are worse endings, you know.</string>
  <string id="6081256">Well, that's comforting. It's the most dangerous thing we could ever do. But at least we know that.</string>
  <string id="6081257">At least one of us is confident.</string>
  <string id="6081258">The scary part is, when you say that, I actually start to believe it. I must be going crazy in my old age.</string>
  <string id="6081259">Laughs I think looters hit it before the fighting started. Nobody wants to pillage sober.</string>
  <string id="6081260">While my brothers must raid human lands for females, here with shiny rocks you give me your females. Any slave I choose!</string>
  <string id="6081270">Sighs</string>
  <string id="6081273">My fellow mages, heed me!</string>
  <string id="6081276">The templars will come. For all our power, we cannot defeat such an army.</string>
  <string id="6081279">There is only one option for us all: survive. Do not submit! Do not fall on your knees before them!</string>
  <string id="6081282">Get out of Kirkwall—spread word to the other Circles.</string>
  <string id="6081285">They will not get away with this.</string>
  <string id="6081291">Prepare your people, Champion, and then speak with me. If we have any chance of surviving, it will be with your help.</string>
  <string id="6081306">He is no longer the viscount's son. Viddathari give up their lives for the certainty only Qunari know.</string>
  <string id="6081307">And?</string>
  <string id="6081310">The enemy of your enemy should be your friend?</string>
  <string id="6081319">Yes. It's true. I could've handed the relic back to the Qunari or never stolen it in the first place.</string>
  <string id="6081322">I didn't because I'm selfish. You were right about that, too.</string>
  <string id="6081332">Oh great, darkspawn. How delightful. You should stay away from me—I seem to attract them.</string>
  <string id="6081333">Darkspawn in the city? Jalen should hear about this.</string>
  <string id="6081334">We should not tarry here overlong. Darkspawn often bring disease with them.</string>
  <string id="6081335">So that's a darkspawn. You hear stories of them, but firsthand... What are they doing here?</string>
  <string id="6081336">Strange place to find darkspawn. How has no-one noticed them?</string>
  <string id="6081340">The herbalist says she's going to live.</string>
  <string id="6081341">He is not even here.</string>
  <string id="6081346">You would not take advantage of his connections?</string>
  <string id="6081349">The Qun may demand that advantage, but I do not. It was his choice to be educated. He is not my prisoner.</string>
  <string id="6081360">Are you prepared, Champion? I believe the battle is almost upon us.</string>
  <string id="6081361">You don't believe there's a chance of winning this fight?</string>
  <string id="6081362">Is there truly no hope?</string>
  <string id="6081363">With you on our side? Perhaps.</string>
  <string id="6081366">But even if we win, what then? More templars would come, with even larger armies.</string>
  <string id="6081369">We are apostates now. Our only hope lies in the Circles elsewhere in Thedas.</string>
  <string id="6081372">They could rise up with us against this injustice. I assure you, however, we will find sympathy nowhere else.</string>
  <string id="6081373">Let them come.</string>
  <string id="6081374">We're ready.</string>
  <string id="6081375">We will defend you as best we can.</string>
  <string id="6081376">We're ready.</string>
  <string id="6081377">I am relieved to hear it.</string>
  <string id="6081380">Let the games begin.</string>
  <string id="6081381">We're ready.</string>
  <string id="6081382">Very well.</string>
  <string id="6081385">You will need to give orders to your companions, and I will do the same for my people.</string>
  <string id="6081388">We're not ready to start yet.</string>
  <string id="6081389">We need more time.</string>
  <string id="6081390">Then be quick. The templars will not give us the luxury of time.</string>
  <string id="6081393">Hopefully some of them know how to read.</string>
  <string id="6081396">First dragons, then spiders, and now undead! If I weren't a practical man, I would say the Bone Pit is cursed.</string>
  <string id="6081399">Pains me to say it, but we may have to cut into profits and hire guards to protect the mines. But it can wait until next year...</string>
  <string id="6081405">The miners have stopped working again! A pest infestation this time. Can you deal with it?</string>
  <string id="6081409">Now the workers are claiming the mine is haunted! Please go straighten them out.</string>
  <string id="6081415">It's getting hot in the mines! Usually cold as a tomb. Last time it felt this way, them dragons attacked.</string>
  <string id="6081427">Me and the boys used to go hunting around here. Lately, though, there's no wildlife. Not even one scrawny grouse!</string>
  <string id="6081433">Cod and Fuldey went missing. Couple days later we found Cod, half eaten with big claw marks. Fuldey's still missing...</string>
  <string id="6081436">Plug your nose if you go down in them mines. There's this awful new stench! We can't figure out what's causing it.</string>
  <string id="6081443">I wish someone would stop our shipments being ambushed. We work hard to dig up that gold!</string>
  <string id="6081446">Maybe Hubert should've let you handle the investigation. He's been at it for a year now!</string>
  <string id="6081452">I heard you finally stopped those cargo ambushes. And I thought I knew Sabin...</string>
  <string id="6081461">DuPuis Estate</string>
  <string id="6081534">Jelden</string>
  <string id="6081587">We haven't always seen eye to eye, height notwithstanding.</string>
  <string id="6081588">You know me, Hawke. I'm not one for long goodbyes.</string>
  <string id="6081596">I don't fear the whole of them together, and it is not my role to reject the free choice of viddathari.</string>
  <string id="6081599">The son responded to his own demand of the Qun. He is neither my slave nor my prisoner.</string>
  <string id="6081610">Wallop mallet? You must be the one I'm supposed to give this note to.</string>
  <string id="6081619">But this... defending innocent people, preserving our way of life? This is worth doing.</string>
  <string id="6081652">I'm not sure we should be doing this. Helping dangerous people run amok. But I'm with you.</string>
  <string id="6081654">That seems... strange.</string>
  <string id="6081655">Can you clarify?</string>
  <string id="6081656">That probably could have been mentioned earlier.</string>
  <string id="6081657">All right, what?</string>
  <string id="6081660">The viscount would involve the Chantry?</string>
  <string id="6081663">I doubt he'd involve the Chantry in such a personal matter.</string>
  <string id="6081666">The viscount would not involve the Chantry.</string>
  <string id="6081669">He is strained with the Chantry. He would not involve them.</string>
  <string id="6081672">Would the viscount really involve them in a meeting with his son?</string>
  <string id="6081675">No. But we know who would. Mother Petrice.</string>
  <string id="6081676">The viscount wouldn't involve them. It's Mother Petrice.</string>
  <string id="6081680">What about me? What should I do?</string>
  <string id="6081683">We could use some healing, or any other spells you can offer.</string>
  <string id="6081686">I'll try to keep you in sight, then.</string>
  <string id="6081689">I want to help as well, even if I'm not fighting at your side.</string>
  <string id="6081692">Merrill, attack from a distance. Stay out of the fight as much as you can.</string>
  <string id="6081695">I will.</string>
  <string id="6081698">I should be at your side, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6081701">Aveline, charge in whenever you see an opening.</string>
  <string id="6081704">Very well.</string>
  <string id="6081707">So what shall the rest of us do?</string>
  <string id="6081710">Fenris, I want you to stay close. Help out when you can.</string>
  <string id="6081713">As you wish.</string>
  <string id="6081716">And where do you want me? Shall I cheer you on?</string>
  <string id="6081719">Isabela, I want you to fight from stealth. Keep them confused.</string>
  <string id="6081722">Sounds like fun.</string>
  <string id="6081725">You got a plan for the rest of us?</string>
  <string id="6081728">Varric, stay out of sight and use your crossbow.</string>
  <string id="6081731">Bianca's ready and willing.</string>
  <string id="6081734">I'd like to help, as well.</string>
  <string id="6081737">Bethany, keep out of the fray and use your spells at a distance.</string>
  <string id="6081740">I'll try.</string>
  <string id="6081743">And where do you want me?</string>
  <string id="6081746">Carver, watch and keep us from being overwhelmed.</string>
  <string id="6081749">Got it.</string>
  <string id="6081788">Champion. The attack is about to begin.</string>
  <string id="6081789">Champion. It is beginning.</string>
  <string id="6081800">No way the viscount would involve the Chantry. It's that bitch, Petrice.</string>
  <string id="6081801">Not exactly strong supporters of the viscount. But it makes sense for Petrice.</string>
  <string id="6081810">Hold! You will surrender the relic!</string>
  <string id="6081813">I don't have your stupid relic!</string>
  <string id="6081816">The bas has no honor. Kill it!</string>
  <string id="6081839">Oh, come on. It's not like they're taking up room in the brothels.</string>
  <string id="6081840">A panic? Whatever for?</string>
  <string id="6081849">What are the Qunari doing here?</string>
  <string id="6081878">DEBUG - Click to advance Crit Path plot</string>
  <string id="6081927">During act 2, you have completed three Qunari-related plots. The plots revolved around culture and religious conflicts between the Qunari and the people of Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6081930">The last plot invovled the Viscount's own son getting killed by chantry assassins after he tried to convert to the qun.</string>
  <string id="6081933">If Isabela was hired then she also ran away with the relic the qunari were looking for, while you were trying to help her find it.</string>
  <string id="6081936">You are now being jumped to your home, where Aveline is waiting for you.</string>
  <string id="6081941">DEBUG - Click to advance Crit Path plot</string>
  <string id="6081959">the conflict between templars and mages in Kirkwall is getting more serious. You have playes through several plots that invovled templars and mages trying to kill each other.</string>
  <string id="6081962">Meredith is about to send you a letter, asking your help once again. You are about to be jumped into your home, where the later is waiting for you.</string>
  <string id="6081965">Who is involved in this exchange?</string>
  <string id="6081966">Who are Sam's buyers?</string>
  <string id="6081967">Tevinter mages. I doubt they'll look kindly on us interrupting. Bring a sword. Or twelve.</string>
  <string id="6081977">There's no telling what's waiting for us.</string>
  <string id="6081978">Get ready.</string>
  <string id="6081979">Whatever I'm going into, it's good to have you along.</string>
  <string id="6081980">I'm glad you're here.</string>
  <string id="6081981">We've faced down worse things than this, Varric. What could possibly go wrong?</string>
  <string id="6081982">It'll be fun.</string>
  <string id="6081984">If the Arishok asks why we killed his men, we'll say it was an accident.</string>
  <string id="6081985">What is this? Why do the Qunari want this relic?</string>
  <string id="6081988">Er... yes. About that. The relic belongs to the Qunari, and there's a small chance they want it back.</string>
  <string id="6081994">You saved us, Champion. When we reach Kirkwall, we'll send help for the wounded.</string>
  <string id="6081997">Robart reported dragons in the region, but they could have gone anywhere. I simply wanted to avoid panic.</string>
  <string id="6082002">It's always something with this mine.</string>
  <string id="6082003">It figures.</string>
  <string id="6082014">A suspect in many things.</string>
  <string id="6082017">If she has threatened someone under my command again, there is only one response.</string>
  <string id="6082018">Don't make things worse by marching your men through the streets without cause.</string>
  <string id="6082019">Let me handle this.</string>
  <string id="6082020">This is cause.</string>
  <string id="6082023">This is the last insult I will suffer, Hawke. I will be watching.</string>
  <string id="6082026">Viddathari are of the Qun. This offense will have an answer.</string>
  <string id="6082027">I will not trust it to you alone. Not with your secrets. I will be watching.</string>
  <string id="6082028">I've had about enough of Petrice. Several times over.</string>
  <string id="6082029">I agree. She's dead.</string>
  <string id="6082034">Was it your plan that the dragons would kill me?</string>
  <string id="6082035">You sent me here to die?</string>
  <string id="6082036">Not at all!</string>
  <string id="6082039">You knew dragons were coming and you kept it to yourself?</string>
  <string id="6082040">What were you thinking?</string>
  <string id="6082043">A threat against viddathari can have only one answer. I will suffer only one outcome.</string>
  <string id="6082046">I will be watching, Hawke. The demand of the Qun is clear.</string>
  <string id="6082064">Here they come!</string>
  <string id="6082070">Break it down.</string>
  <string id="6082076">Stop them!</string>
  <string id="6082079">Screams</string>
  <string id="6082085">Screams</string>
  <string id="6082092">I thought you would come to your senses.</string>
  <string id="6082095">You're a mage and an apostate, but I suppose that never stopped anyone from being a fool.</string>
  <string id="6082096">And here you come, ready to do the templars' dirty work.</string>
  <string id="6082099">Do you expect a reward? A hug from the knight-commander? Are you that big a fool?</string>
  <string id="6082100">Back off. You don't want to get in my way.</string>
  <string id="6082101">We don't need to fight.</string>
  <string id="6082102">I would rather die than see you do this.</string>
  <string id="6082105">I let you go, Anders. You shouldn't be here.</string>
  <string id="6082106">We don't need to fight.</string>
  <string id="6082107">I set the fire. I can't just walk away.</string>
  <string id="6082110">I don't suppose reminding you of the good times we had would help?</string>
  <string id="6082111">We don't need to fight.</string>
  <string id="6082112">Will it change your mind?</string>
  <string id="6082115">I loved you once, but I cannot watch you do this.</string>
  <string id="6082116">I'm grateful we met. I wish it didn't have to end like this.</string>
  <string id="6082117">I tried to work with you, Hawke, but we both knew it would come to this.</string>
  <string id="6082118">Says the man who kills helpless priests.</string>
  <string id="6082119">Look who's talking.</string>
  <string id="6082120">You surrendered the moral high ground with the Chantry, Anders.</string>
  <string id="6082121">Look who's talking.</string>
  <string id="6082122">Maybe you'd like to talk about who started this slaughter?</string>
  <string id="6082123">Look who's talking.</string>
  <string id="6082124">I only brought to a head what was already festering.</string>
  <string id="6082127">Kirkwall is my home, and I intend to protect it.</string>
  <string id="6082128">I'm doing what I have to.</string>
  <string id="6082129">An apostate doesn't have a home—just somewhere to hide.</string>
  <string id="6082132">From us. From me.</string>
  <string id="6082135">It would have been nice to have a home, instead of a cell or a hiding place.</string>
  <string id="6082138">But I'm wasting my breath. Let's end this.</string>
  <string id="6082142">I must admit, I was hoping it would be the knight-commander that killed me. Not you.</string>
  <string id="6082143">Stay out of my way, Merrill, and I won't have to kill you.</string>
  <string id="6082144">We don't need to fight.</string>
  <string id="6082145">It's not too late to join me, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6082146">We don't need to fight.</string>
  <string id="6082147">I'm pretty sure Meredith wouldn't offer to spare you.</string>
  <string id="6082148">We don't need to fight.</string>
  <string id="6082149">If I leave these mages to die, or I help you kill them... what then?</string>
  <string id="6082152">Magic can't be made safe, and it can't be destroyed. Fear makes men more dangerous than magic ever could.</string>
  <string id="6082155">But you... I thought— Well, it doesn't matter what I thought.</string>
  <string id="6082156">How did it come to this? You were my one true friend.</string>
  <string id="6082157">But we were never friends, and this argument is pointless. Let it end.</string>
  <string id="6082158">See, I was hoping I would get this chance.</string>
  <string id="6082159">Your tough luck.</string>
  <string id="6082160">Good. That will make this easier.</string>
  <string id="6082161">Let's see how you do, then.</string>
  <string id="6082162">I'm sorry it had to end like this, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6082163">Your tough luck.</string>
  <string id="6082164">As am I.</string>
  <string id="6082165">You can't always get what you want.</string>
  <string id="6082166">Your tough luck.</string>
  <string id="6082167">True.</string>
  <string id="6082168">I'm defending my home, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6082169">I have to do this.</string>
  <string id="6082170">Let that be enough to clear your conscience, then.</string>
  <string id="6082171">And I'm defending everything I hold dear.</string>
  <string id="6082178">I didn't want it to come to this, Hawke. You didn't have to be here.</string>
  <string id="6082179">Stay out of our way and you won't need to die, Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6082180">We don't have to fight.</string>
  <string id="6082181">You don't really want to do this, Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6082182">We don't have to fight.</string>
  <string id="6082183">So you'll obey the orders of that crazy bitch, no matter what?</string>
  <string id="6082184">We don't have to fight.</string>
  <string id="6082185">The grand cleric, a good woman, is dead. I'd hoped for compromise, but no more.</string>
  <string id="6082194">I would have defended you to the last, but not today.</string>
  <string id="6082195">We both should have seen this coming.</string>
  <string id="6082196">You made your choice, Aveline. Just like I did.</string>
  <string id="6082197">Neither did you.</string>
  <string id="6082198">You're blindly following orders. What if they're wrong?</string>
  <string id="6082199">Neither did you.</string>
  <string id="6082200">Funny, I don't remember you becoming a templar.</string>
  <string id="6082201">Neither did you.</string>
  <string id="6082202">Some things must be. Our friendship began in death. You seem fixed on ending it there.</string>
  <string id="6082203">I stand for this city, and if necessary, I will fall—like so many good people before me.</string>
  <string id="6082204">They don't deserve this, Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6082205">Yes, I did.</string>
  <string id="6082206">Nobody deserves what happened today, but you made it necessary.</string>
  <string id="6082210">Look at them. Backed into a corner, they show their true colors.</string>
  <string id="6082213">Why you're defending them, I'll never know. This is an old story that always ends the same way.</string>
  <string id="6082214">Just stay out of our way, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6082215">We don't have to fight.</string>
  <string id="6082216">They're not your enemies, Fenris, and neither am I.</string>
  <string id="6082217">We don't have to fight.</string>
  <string id="6082218">What's next? Templar uniform? Meredith makes you her favorite killer elf?</string>
  <string id="6082219">We don't have to fight.</string>
  <string id="6082220">You've never been to the Imperium.</string>
  <string id="6082223">There, the mages spit on us. They keep people like me as pets.</string>
  <string id="6082226">You think I won't fight to stop that from happening here? Think again.</string>
  <string id="6082229">Not this time it doesn't.</string>
  <string id="6082230">It ends with you dying.</string>
  <string id="6082231">Let's see.</string>
  <string id="6082232">I'm not letting you kill us.</string>
  <string id="6082233">It ends with you dying.</string>
  <string id="6082234">I'd be disappointed if you did.</string>
  <string id="6082235">You know what happens to the sidekick in those stories?</string>
  <string id="6082236">It ends with you dying.</string>
  <string id="6082237">And you're the valiant hero? Saving the poor, oppressed blood mages?</string>
  <string id="6082240">And you're the valiant heroine? Saving the poor, oppressed blood mages?</string>
  <string id="6082243">You of all people should know what it means to be a slave.</string>
  <string id="6082244">This is wrong.</string>
  <string id="6082245">Why should it surprise you? I'm no different than them.</string>
  <string id="6082246">I'm a mage, too.</string>
  <string id="6082247">Wish I'd realized that when we first met.</string>
  <string id="6082250">I should have known better than to let you get so close. First rule of survival.</string>
  <string id="6082254">I suppose that's what I get for befriending a mage.</string>
  <string id="6082255">I just wish this wasn't necessary. Sorry, friend.</string>
  <string id="6082256">You die or I die. Either way the story's done.</string>
  <string id="6082257">Andraste be my witness, Wilmod. I will have the truth from you. Now!</string>
  <string id="6082260">Mercy, ser, mercy!</string>
  <string id="6082263">Were it that easy.</string>
  <string id="6082266">Don't hit me.</string>
  <string id="6082269">I will know where you're going. And I will know now.</string>
  <string id="6082270">Don't you lay another hand on that boy.</string>
  <string id="6082271">Step back.</string>
  <string id="6082272">I thought templars only treated mages this badly. Nice to see you're branching out.</string>
  <string id="6082273">So you torture recruits now?</string>
  <string id="6082274">Why are you doing this to Wilmod? Answer me.</string>
  <string id="6082275">What are you doing?</string>
  <string id="6082276">This is templar business, stranger.</string>
  <string id="6082279">Laughs You have struck me the last time, you pathetic human. To me!</string>
  <string id="6082282">Maker preserve us.</string>
  <string id="6082283">I knew... I knew he was involved in something sinister.</string>
  <string id="6082286">But this. Is it even possible?</string>
  <string id="6082289">I am Knight-Captain Cullen. I thank you for your assistance.</string>
  <string id="6082296">If you didn't know he was possessed, why draw your sword on a recruit?</string>
  <string id="6082297">Why did you attack Wilmod?</string>
  <string id="6082298">He had only been back a few days when he left again secretly. It set off some warning bells.</string>
  <string id="6082301">I meant to scare him into a confession. He had to believe my threats were genuine.</string>
  <string id="6082302">Do you know what happened to Wilmod while he was gone?</string>
  <string id="6082303">What do you think happened?</string>
  <string id="6082304">Obviously more than I had anticipated.</string>
  <string id="6082311">Wilmod has never been fully... convinced of the Order's rules. Mages cannot be our friends. They must always be watched.</string>
  <string id="6082314">I thought Wilmod might be meeting with some old friends who'd escaped the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6082315">I've got friends who are mages. Are you saying they need to always be watched, as well?</string>
  <string id="6082316">Not all mages are bad.</string>
  <string id="6082319">I was at the Circle Tower in Ferelden during the Blight. I saw firsthand how templars' trust and leniency can be rewarded.</string>
  <string id="6082322">A firmer rein may have prevented that entire Circle from being annulled.</string>
  <string id="6082325">I still have nightmares of Uldred's depravities.</string>
  <string id="6082342">The recruits believed that Meredith was conducting some sort of deadly ritual.</string>
  <string id="6082343">So there's no ritual?</string>
  <string id="6082344">What? That's preposterous.</string>
  <string id="6082347">Recruits can be worse than a weaving circle with their rumors.</string>
  <string id="6082350">There is a vigil before templars take their arms, but the gravest danger they face is falling asleep.</string>
  <string id="6082372">I  fear we're already too late. Wilmod disappeared along with another lad, Keran, a good boy.</string>
  <string id="6082421">Do you need something, honey?</string>
  <string id="6082422">You don't work here, do you? With the customers?</string>
  <string id="6082423">Are you one of the girls?</string>
  <string id="6082495">Sighs It's  beautiful, isn't it? This tree is one of the only things left that reminds us city elves of who we are.</string>
  <string id="6082559">You will resolve this matter with these agents of the Chantry, Hawke. I am watching.</string>
  <string id="6082563">Look at this: my brother's junk was left here.</string>
  <string id="6082574">Serah Hawke, look at what you have done.</string>
  <string id="6082576">Is there something you want?</string>
  <string id="6082583">A couple of templar recruits went missing. They were last seen here.</string>
  <string id="6082584">Do you know Wilmod? Keran?</string>
  <string id="6082585">You'll have to be specific. We do a lot of business with the templars.</string>
  <string id="6082588">Wilmod. Keran. Heard of them?</string>
  <string id="6082591">I could check the books. But clients expect a certain amount of discretion here. You know how it is.</string>
  <string id="6082592">Perhaps a few coins can loosen your lips.</string>
  <string id="6082593">I'll make it worth your while.</string>
  <string id="6082594">Are you trying to bribe me? You know, not all the girls here are for sale.</string>
  <string id="6082597">I'm going to pretend that didn't happen.</string>
  <string id="6082598">We have a lot of missing templars. If we don't act quickly, we may only find corpses.</string>
  <string id="6082599">People's lives are at stake.</string>
  <string id="6082600">Now, now. No need to get all dramatic on me.</string>
  <string id="6082603">Let me look through the books. Wilmod... Keran...</string>
  <string id="6082609">Here we go. Wilmod came in here a lot. You sure he had time to be a templar?</string>
  <string id="6082615">The both of them last saw Idunna the Exotic Wonder from the East.</string>
  <string id="6082616">The templars are the ones who want this information.</string>
  <string id="6082617">It's a templar investigation.</string>
  <string id="6082618">I have matters to attend to.</string>
  <string id="6082619">I'll come back later.</string>
  <string id="6082675">To pounce upon the viscount's son, a repentant convert, in the chantry itself? A crime with no excuse.</string>
  <string id="6082676">Are you mad? Your plans have fallen to outright murder?</string>
  <string id="6082677">You did this!</string>
  <string id="6082679">I have kept the fear of the Qunari fresh in every sermon, every prayer. They will know whose word to believe.</string>
  <string id="6082680">You've been a headache, but to outright kill someone? That's new for you.</string>
  <string id="6082681">Why kill Saemus?</string>
  <string id="6082682">All this will do is make people hate you.</string>
  <string id="6082683">How does this help anything?</string>
  <string id="6082691">Where is that voice coming from?</string>
  <string id="6082694">I can barely hear it... I wish I could make out the words.</string>
  <string id="6082695">The idol is close, I know it!</string>
  <string id="6082696">Where are you? I know you're here.</string>
  <string id="6082741">We make a lot of our money off of nervous templars that expect some privacy.</string>
  <string id="6082796">The faithful know this has been building for a long time. Where Varnell incited, I reminded, in sermon and prayer.</string>
  <string id="6082812">He deliberately denied the Maker! How many would follow if he went unpunished?</string>
  <string id="6082813">Laughs Thank the Maker for that.</string>
  <string id="6082922">Single-handedly saved the city from the heathens, huh?</string>
  <string id="6082925">The viscount should have paid me a finder's fee.</string>
  <string id="6082930">So, you're moving up in the world. Got some coin to share with your favorite uncle?</string>
  <string id="6082945">When people learn of this attack, they will rise. Not zealots or the unknowing, but the true majority.</string>
  <string id="6082978">Jansen... help is here. Hold on.</string>
  <string id="6082981">Jansen, my friend. You look a bit worse for the wear.</string>
  <string id="6082984">Jansen. I'm here to get you to safety. We don't have much time.</string>
  <string id="6082987">He's dying. There is nothing I can do.</string>
  <string id="6082990">This one's beyond help.</string>
  <string id="6082993">That's a nasty wound.</string>
  <string id="6082996">The wound rots. His death is certain.</string>
  <string id="6082999">That wound has festered. It's... not good.</string>
  <string id="6083002">The... Champion of Kirkwall. I knew you'd come.</string>
  <string id="6083005">He's delirious. Been trying to tell me something, but I can't make it out.</string>
  <string id="6083023">Have mercy, we beg you!</string>
  <string id="6083026">Do whatever you want with us, but let us live!</string>
  <string id="6083029">No.</string>
  <string id="6083032">This Circle is beyond redemption.</string>
  <string id="6083035">Knight-Commander, surely the Right of Annulment requires something more—</string>
  <string id="6083038">It requires my word, Cullen. Do as I've commanded.</string>
  <string id="6083041">Champion! Will you not defend us? Must we all be slaughtered for the actions of a few?</string>
  <string id="6083042">I want to hear what the knight-captain has to say.</string>
  <string id="6083043">What does Cullen think?</string>
  <string id="6083044">I...</string>
  <string id="6083047">The Right has always been a last resort, when every mage involved was beyond salvation.</string>
  <string id="6083050">The situation was far more dire in Ferelden's Circle, and yet many mages were saved. We could still do as much here.</string>
  <string id="6083053">When Ferelden's Circle was lost, the situation was far worse than this. I can't believe wholesale slaughter is the only answer.</string>
  <string id="6083056">Objection noted, Captain.</string>
  <string id="6083057">Is there a way to tell if they're blood mages?</string>
  <string id="6083058">Are they innocent?</string>
  <string id="6083059">There is not.</string>
  <string id="6083062">But they haven't resorted to it, even to save their own lives. Perhaps, if we watched them carefully—</string>
  <string id="6083065">And if they hope to escape by playing innocent? Will you accept that responsibility, Cullen?</string>
  <string id="6083068">Yes. I believe that's what being a templar is about.</string>
  <string id="6083071">And I say we are here to protect the people. We must be judges, jailors, and even executioners.</string>
  <string id="6083072">Maybe they can answer some questions.</string>
  <string id="6083073">Can they tell us anything?</string>
  <string id="6083074">I think the first enchanter is still in the tower. He... said he had a plan, something that would stop you.</string>
  <string id="6083077">Demons? Or something worse?</string>
  <string id="6083080">I don't know. We wanted nothing to do with it, so we ran.</string>
  <string id="6083083">Please, help us! We've done nothing wrong!</string>
  <string id="6083084">Take them into custody.</string>
  <string id="6083085">Spare them.</string>
  <string id="6083086">We're here to prevent a crisis, not raze everything in our path.</string>
  <string id="6083087">Spare them.</string>
  <string id="6083088">They've already surrendered. Killing them now is just petty.</string>
  <string id="6083089">Spare them.</string>
  <string id="6083093">Listen to the Champion.</string>
  <string id="6083099">The time for mercy is over.</string>
  <string id="6083100">We do this Meredith's way.</string>
  <string id="6083101">Our hands are tied.</string>
  <string id="6083102">We do this Meredith's way.</string>
  <string id="6083103">There's no point in stopping now, is there?</string>
  <string id="6083104">We do this Meredith's way.</string>
  <string id="6083105">Perhaps you're right.</string>
  <string id="6083108">Do as the Champion commands.</string>
  <string id="6083111">I'm not the head of the templars.</string>
  <string id="6083112">It's not my decision.</string>
  <string id="6083113">Indeed. Since when do you look to the Champion for orders, Captain?</string>
  <string id="6083116">Carry out the sentence.</string>
  <string id="6083125">Continue the assault.</string>
  <string id="6083141">Dragons. You never get used to the sight of them...</string>
  <string id="6083142">Dragons! The legends of this place must be true. They've returned to take what's theirs.</string>
  <string id="6083143">Seems the dragons want their pit back.</string>
  <string id="6083144">After all these years, dragons have returned to the Bone Pit.</string>
  <string id="6083145">Dragons. Further proof this place is cursed.</string>
  <string id="6083146">I always thought dragons were supposed to be rare.</string>
  <string id="6083156">So many injured... We'll never be able to get them all out in time.</string>
  <string id="6083157">So few survivors... and we'll lose more if we try to move them.</string>
  <string id="6083158">Even were we all healers, it would be impossible to help everyone.</string>
  <string id="6083159">So many injured and dying...</string>
  <string id="6083160">This cave stinks of death. These people won't leave here alive.</string>
  <string id="6083165">Go to Smetty's Fish Guttery on the docks at night and look inside crate 1023.</string>
  <string id="6083184">Your Qunari masters will finally answer.</string>
  <string id="6083187">Dating Service</string>
  <string id="6083188">Look into setting things right between Gamlen and Pricia Corthwaite. She can be found by day in Hightown.</string>
  <string id="6083195">Pricia Corthwaite agreed to let Gamlen court her.</string>
  <string id="6083196">Pricia Corthwaite refused Gamlen's advances.</string>
  <string id="6083199">It's the only thing that'll get Castillon off my back. Please tell me you'll give the relic to me.</string>
  <string id="6083204">Corthwaite's Boutique</string>
  <string id="6083209">I can't believe you're... ugh!</string>
  <string id="6083237">Sighs Fine, you're right. I'll return the relic. It'll go straight to the Qunari once we get it.</string>
  <string id="6083243">Corthwaite's Boutique</string>
  <string id="6083247">Corthwaite's Boutique</string>
  <string id="6083251">And yet, even this sympathizer will inspire vengeance when his brutal murder is exposed.</string>
  <string id="6083254">You won't get the Qunari ousted, you'll get a slaughter. On both sides.</string>
  <string id="6083268">Patron</string>
  <string id="6083270">Patron</string>
  <string id="6083280">Forgive me. I should introduce myself properly.</string>
  <string id="6083305">Just as I suspected all along.</string>
  <string id="6083308">Willing sacrifices! Men and women who would have died at your hands anyhow!</string>
  <string id="6083311">The irony is that until this very moment, I have never used blood magic.</string>
  <string id="6083314">Do you take me for a fool? One does not summon such a ritual from thin air!</string>
  <string id="6083317">The rite belonged to Quentin, a man the Champion is familiar with. I put aside his research as too dangerous—but things have changed.</string>
  <string id="6083318">You were working with that murderer?</string>
  <string id="6083319">Quentin killed my mother!</string>
  <string id="6083320">I knew about him. I kept his existence secret because I didn't want to give Meredith more ammunition against us.</string>
  <string id="6083323">But... you could have stopped him! You could have saved her!</string>
  <string id="6083326">I'm sorry, my dear. I didn't know the extent of his derangement until it was too late.</string>
  <string id="6083327">I see now I needn't have bothered.</string>
  <string id="6083328">You've taken this too far.</string>
  <string id="6083329">You need to die.</string>
  <string id="6083330">Yes, I'm the one who's taken it too far.</string>
  <string id="6083331">It's not too late to stop this, First Enchanter.</string>
  <string id="6083332">We can still help you.</string>
  <string id="6083333">Not too late? Look around you! Look at what we've become!</string>
  <string id="6083334">This doesn't exactly support your claim of innocence, does it?</string>
  <string id="6083335">You only prove her right.</string>
  <string id="6083336">Look at it all.</string>
  <string id="6083339">Why don't they just drown us as infants? Why wait? Why give us the illusion of hope?</string>
  <string id="6083342">First Enchanter, we need to—</string>
  <string id="6083345">I refuse to keep running! I won't wait for her to kill me.</string>
  <string id="6083346">I hope you aren't giving up without taking a shot at Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6083347">This is no time to surrender.</string>
  <string id="6083348">I am not giving up. I am giving in.</string>
  <string id="6083351">Meredith will die long before you do.</string>
  <string id="6083352">Then we kill her first.</string>
  <string id="6083353">If only I could believe that.</string>
  <string id="6083356">This is not helping, First Enchanter.</string>
  <string id="6083357">You need to calm down.</string>
  <string id="6083358">I am tired of helping, as well.</string>
  <string id="6083361">Quentin's research was too evil, too dangerous, so I put it aside. But I see now there is no other way.</string>
  <string id="6083364">Meredith expects blood magic? Then I will give it to her. Maker help us all.</string>
  <string id="6083365">Like I said, we never talked.</string>
  <string id="6083366">That's quite the stage name.</string>
  <string id="6083367">The Exotic Wonder?</string>
  <string id="6083368">It sounds better than the Tramp From Darktown.</string>
  <string id="6083371">You should hear what some of the others are called.</string>
  <string id="6083372">Is there anything else you can tell me?</string>
  <string id="6083373">Do you know anything else?</string>
  <string id="6083374">Honey, I could write volumes on the things I know.</string>
  <string id="6083377">Unless you want Wilmod's favorite position, I think you have what you need.</string>
  <string id="6083380">Thank you for your help.</string>
  <string id="6083381">I have what I need.</string>
  <string id="6083382">Sure thing. And listen...</string>
  <string id="6083385">You didn't hear any of this from me. We clear?</string>
  <string id="6083388">The merchandise is up front.</string>
  <string id="6083389">Isabela!</string>
  <string id="6083392">To die untested would be the real crime. People need the opportunity to defend faith. Starting with you.</string>
  <string id="6083398"> What do you want me to do about it?</string>
  <string id="6083399">Your point is?</string>
  <string id="6083400">You want me to use my wily, wily ways to find out where the Dalish are hiding this elf?</string>
  <string id="6083401"> Let me guess what comes next.</string>
  <string id="6083402">That is part of it, yes. This elf is very dangerous, and he must be brought in before he kills again. </string>
  <string id="6083405">My name is Nuncio Caldera Lanos, I am a noble from the beautiful country of Antiva.</string>
  <string id="6083424">Earn your reward in this life and next! These heretics must die!</string>
  <string id="6083425">Aw, shit. She still owes me twenty silvers!</string>
  <string id="6083426">Once a thief, always a thief.</string>
  <string id="6083428">She's gone then? Can't say I blame her.</string>
  <string id="6083429">She'll come back, won't she? She wouldn't just leave us! At least... I hope not.</string>
  <string id="6083432">I finally realized what was necessary, Serah Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6083436">He's a master manipulator who will endanger even his own kind to ensure his survival.</string>
  <string id="6083442">The viscount's son denies the Maker and submits to the Qun? I couldn't let that stand.</string>
  <string id="6083445">But for every challenge, an opportunity. If his Qunari masters murdered him as he tried to escape, it would spur the faithful.</string>
  <string id="6083448">Don't you agree? Or was your offer of loyalty temporary?</string>
  <string id="6083457">Look around you, Champion. I am well past caring.</string>
  <string id="6083460">The Maker has guided us here to end your evil, Orsino.</string>
  <string id="6083463">The Maker has guided you all to your deaths!</string>
  <string id="6083469">No! You said he wouldn't be hurt!</string>
  <string id="6083472">No! You said she wouldn't be hurt!</string>
  <string id="6083475">I am sorry, child, but true justice demands sacrifice from us all.</string>
  <string id="6083478">Your assassin is no fool. I doubt the Dalish would hand a fellow elf over to you, murderer or no.</string>
  <string id="6083479">Smart hiding among the Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6083486">Ah, so you see my problem. Where that elf goes, death follows. He must be captured quickly.</string>
  <string id="6083487">You go too far! He made a free choice!</string>
  <string id="6083488">I can't allow this!</string>
  <string id="6083496">The choice to be wrong. I have to save others from his mistake.</string>
  <string id="6083499">It seems I was wrong about you, Hawke. You are closer to the Qunari than you admit.</string>
  <string id="6083502">If it means I'm far away from you, I'm good with that.</string>
  <string id="6083509">I'm loyal, but the Qunari know.</string>
  <string id="6083512">Find out where the assassin is hiding, and apprehend him.</string>
  <string id="6083514">The Arishok was right not to trust you.</string>
  <string id="6083517">Stand with my men, Serah Hawke, and we will show the good people of Kirkwall how to test their faith!</string>
  <string id="6083520">For the Maker's glory, the heretics must die!</string>
  <string id="6083521">You're not leaving without the miners, are you?</string>
  <string id="6083522">Are the miners safe?</string>
  <string id="6083523">It's not like that! We're clearing the way so they can escape before the high dragon returns.</string>
  <string id="6083526">Come now, high dragons are exceedingly rare, and I've already slain one of them.</string>
  <string id="6083529">A high dragon? Are you sure?</string>
  <string id="6083532">I've read the tales of the Hero of Ferelden. The description matches.</string>
  <string id="6083538">Believe me now? We're running out of time!</string>
  <string id="6083541">Champion, please go to the mines and get the workers on their feet. I'll watch the skies.</string>
  <string id="6083544">A high dragon? So near to Kirkwall?</string>
  <string id="6083547">You should be protecting the miners. Why aren't you with them?</string>
  <string id="6083548">What, are you cowards?</string>
  <string id="6083549">Better save yourselves while you can, right?</string>
  <string id="6083550">So you're running away?</string>
  <string id="6083563">Coterie Encounter</string>
  <string id="6083564">Coterie Encounter</string>
  <string id="6083565">Javaris Encounter</string>
  <string id="6083566">Javaris Encounter</string>
  <string id="6083573">I can't believe it. How could he do this?</string>
  <string id="6083576">Such is the curse that you carry, difficult as it may be to accept.</string>
  <string id="6083579">You! Your insanity drove him to this!</string>
  <string id="6083582">I will not argue with you, mage. My purpose here is clear.</string>
  <string id="6083585">And I'm just one more abomination to be dealt with. Yes, I see what comes next.</string>
  <string id="6083586">Back away from her, Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6083587">You won't harm my sister.</string>
  <string id="6083588">I see.</string>
  <string id="6083591">Have it your way, then. I will meet you in the courtyard, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6083597">Thank you. I don't know if I deserve your help.</string>
  <string id="6083598">I'm helping you anyway.</string>
  <string id="6083599">You don't.</string>
  <string id="6083600">You don't think I could lose you, too?</string>
  <string id="6083601">We're family.</string>
  <string id="6083602">You think I'd let her cut down my own sister?</string>
  <string id="6083603">Don't be silly.</string>
  <string id="6083605">Do what you have to, Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6083606">Go ahead. Kill her.</string>
  <string id="6083607">I hope this was all worth it, Brother.</string>
  <string id="6083610">I hope this was all worth it, Sister.</string>
  <string id="6083613">Grunts</string>
  <string id="6083616">It is over.</string>
  <string id="6083619">I will make sure the Keep is secure. Meet me in the courtyard, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6083622">Let's get out of here.</string>
  <string id="6083623">What a waste.</string>
  <string id="6083624">We'd best get out before they lock the doors.</string>
  <string id="6083625">Let's go. I don't want to stay here a minute longer.</string>
  <string id="6083626">Can we go? I... don't want to be here any longer.</string>
  <string id="6083628">Do you see, Your Grace? Traitors attacking the very core of the Chantry! They defile with every step!</string>
  <string id="6083643">There is death in every corner, young mother. It is as you predicted. All too well.</string>
  <string id="6083647">She's on to you, Petrice. Quick, lie harder.</string>
  <string id="6083648">She already has doubts.</string>
  <string id="6083649">Forgive me, Your Grace. But you must know the truth about what happened here.</string>
  <string id="6083650">There has been a crime.</string>
  <string id="6083651">The young mother arranged all of it.</string>
  <string id="6083652">Petrice is responsible.</string>
  <string id="6083653">Mother Petrice!</string>
  <string id="6083656">Your Grace?</string>
  <string id="6083659">There are battles in every corner. The blood of the faithful... and others. It is as you predicted. All too well.</string>
  <string id="6083662">I am sorry, Your Grace.</string>
  <string id="6083665">Come, Petrice, I would speak to you.</string>
  <string id="6083673">No! How could he do that?</string>
  <string id="6083676">Poor man. Why would he do such a thing?</string>
  <string id="6083679">An act of desperation.</string>
  <string id="6083682">That poor man. What a dreadful end.</string>
  <string id="6083685">Driven to desperation, we are capable of anything.</string>
  <string id="6083688">Let's get moving before more templars arrive.</string>
  <string id="6083689">We'd best get moving. We're not in the clear, yet.</string>
  <string id="6083690">We should go while we still have the chance.</string>
  <string id="6083693">Screams</string>
  <string id="6083694">Don't you spout your Qunari filth. This is a hand of the Divine.</string>
  <string id="6083697">I have ears, Mother Petrice. The Maker would have me use them.</string>
  <string id="6083700">Serah Hawke, is it?</string>
  <string id="6083703">Viscount Dumar's son is dead, killed here in your name.</string>
  <string id="6083706">I'm sure my name won't like that. Petrice?</string>
  <string id="6083709">Saemus Dumar was a Qunari convert! He came here to repent and was murdered!</string>
  <string id="6083710">You killed him so no one would follow his free choice, right or wrong.</string>
  <string id="6083711">Lured by you!</string>
  <string id="6083712">It's a ruse, Your Grace. Saemus was killed to set people against the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6083713">An unfortunate lie.</string>
  <string id="6083714">Love or hate the Qunari, a blind nug could see she took this too far.</string>
  <string id="6083715">Petrice arranged it, and more.</string>
  <string id="6083716">Plot Actions</string>
  <string id="6083717">Plot Actions</string>
  <string id="6083718">What action?</string>
  <string id="6083719">Hear the Arishok Rant in Act 1.</string>
  <string id="6083720">Listening to rant...</string>
  <string id="6083721">Go Back</string>
  <string id="6083722">Go Back</string>
  <string id="6083724">It could not be allowed! How many would be tempted?</string>
  <string id="6083727">As many as would want to go, I suppose.</string>
  <string id="6083736">They deny the Maker!</string>
  <string id="6083739">And you diminish Him, even as you claim His side. Andraste did not volunteer for the flame.</string>
  <string id="6083745">Serah Hawke, you stand with the captain of the guard?</string>
  <string id="6083748">Serah Hawke, you act on behalf of the viscount?</string>
  <string id="6083751">The young mother has erred in her judgment. A court will decide her fate. The Chantry respects the law, and so must she.</string>
  <string id="6083754">Grand Cleric?</string>
  <string id="6083758">This is no longer a matter of heathens squatting in the docks. People are leaving us to join them!</string>
  <string id="6083759">No price is too much when we speak of eternity!</string>
  <string id="6083760">The horse pulling the cart was the only survivor, and it does not speak!</string>
  <string id="6083763">Town full of rotten mages and not one can get answers from a horse?</string>
  <string id="6083764">I'll get there when I get there.</string>
  <string id="6083765">Maybe later.</string>
  <string id="6083766">Please make time for this, Champion. With each passing moment, wealth is being lost. And lives too!</string>
  <string id="6083769">Champion! Catastrophe has struck! I am ruined. Ruined!</string>
  <string id="6083772">And we must pray for them like any other.</string>
  <string id="6083777">Eternity is long enough that we need not rush to meet it.</string>
  <string id="6083788">We protect those of the Qun. We do not abandon our own.</string>
  <string id="6083799">And someone must make this sad event known to Viscount Dumar.</string>
  <string id="6083802">Fools to the highest office.</string>
  <string id="6083805">So you say.</string>
  <string id="6083808">The grand cleric asserts that I failed to maintain the solemn dignity of my position. I am no longer a mother in her service.</string>
  <string id="6083811">But thanks to you, there will be faithful enough that need me. The Chantry is far from united.</string>
  <string id="6083812">I may come calling for your help one of these days.</string>
  <string id="6083813">Can I count on your support?</string>
  <string id="6083814">And I hope to be in a position to offer.</string>
  <string id="6083817">Maker watch over and protect you, Serah Hawke. We will all need that grace soon enough.</string>
  <string id="6083818">I don't care where you go. This is the last I want to see of you.</string>
  <string id="6083819">Just stay away from me.</string>
  <string id="6083820">So be it. Just remember where your loyalties lie.</string>
  <string id="6083823">Stay out of trouble. Really.</string>
  <string id="6083824">Lay low, for once.</string>
  <string id="6083825">That is up to our Qunari friends.</string>
  <string id="6083828">You have information about the missing Qunari?</string>
  <string id="6083832">My wife is in there!</string>
  <string id="6083835">I don't give two shits if you're in or out! But you go in, I can't help you!</string>
  <string id="6083836">You have to do something!</string>
  <string id="6083839">What good does it do if I run in there? I don't know any more than you.</string>
  <string id="6083840">Useless guards!</string>
  <string id="6083843">I'm doing my job: keeping you from killing yourself.</string>
  <string id="6083917">Someone can't take no for an answer, huh? Thanks for the coin.</string>
  <string id="6083922">Simply put, I have a good feeling about you. So what do you say?</string>
  <string id="6083923">What do you sell?</string>
  <string id="6083927">Idunna, right?</string>
  <string id="6083939">Do you remember entertaining a templar named Wilmod a few weeks ago? Or Keran?</string>
  <string id="6083942">Wilmod, Wilmod. That doesn't sound familiar.</string>
  <string id="6083943">I know he saw you frequently.</string>
  <string id="6083944">He was one of your regulars.</string>
  <string id="6083945">With a body like mine, men rarely have time to give me their names. They're too busy doing other things.</string>
  <string id="6083948">Do your clients like this charade? It must get dreadfully tiresome.</string>
  <string id="6083949">Drop the act.</string>
  <string id="6083950">Wh-Whatever do you mean?</string>
  <string id="6083953">Stop playing dumb. Answer my question.</string>
  <string id="6083954">You're lying.</string>
  <string id="6083955">Oh, we like it rough, do we?</string>
  <string id="6083958">Questions are boring. Why don't we have some real fun?</string>
  <string id="6083959">I'm here on business. Keran. Wilmod.</string>
  <string id="6083960">Just answer my question.</string>
  <string id="6083961">As charming and relentless as you are, I'm here to investigate.</string>
  <string id="6083962">You really are persistent.</string>
  <string id="6083964">You've got one more chance to answer me before I make you.</string>
  <string id="6083965">We can do this the hard way.</string>
  <string id="6083966">I'm just trying to make a living. No need to be cross.</string>
  <string id="6083969">Hawke, go easy on this lovely... creature.</string>
  <string id="6083972">Are you certain we can't postpone this, Hawke?</string>
  <string id="6083975">It can't be easy for a girl in her position.</string>
  <string id="6083978">You should listen to your friend.</string>
  <string id="6083981">Who told you about little old me?</string>
  <string id="6083985">We have to get away from these monsters!</string>
  <string id="6083986">We're just here for the elves.</string>
  <string id="6083987">We're not here to argue.</string>
  <string id="6083988">What is this? That darkspawn is trying to fence us in.</string>
  <string id="6083991">Or protect itself.</string>
  <string id="6083994">I might be able to dispel the barrier.</string>
  <string id="6083996">I've come to ask your help, Champion. Hiding among the Dalish is an elven assassin I have been chasing for months.</string>
  <string id="6083997">Is there something I can help you with?</string>
  <string id="6083998">Did you need something?</string>
  <string id="6084004">I've heard of your dealings with the Dalish. I was hoping you could go where my men could not.</string>
  <string id="6084005">You must be the Exotic Wonder of the East.</string>
  <string id="6084008">We have to ask her about Keran. What's your problem?</string>
  <string id="6084009">What's wrong with you?</string>
  <string id="6084013">Yes, yes. But certainly there's no harm mixing a little business and pleasure?</string>
  <string id="6084017">You really can be quite a bore. You know that, right?</string>
  <string id="6084021">I see too many like her. Be gentle, if you can.</string>
  <string id="6084023">I'm asking the questions.</string>
  <string id="6084030">I heard a rumor.</string>
  <string id="6084036">I'm tired of your games.</string>
  <string id="6084113">It was... Viveka. She showed me... her books.</string>
  <string id="6084116">That wasn't so hard, was it?</string>
  <string id="6084119">So Viveka sold me out, did she? That drab, pathetic little sewer rat. She will be dealt with.</string>
  <string id="6084137">Stop this now!</string>
  <string id="6084160">Just do one more thing for me. Draw your blade, and bring it gently across your throat.</string>
  <string id="6084178">I will kill you.</string>
  <string id="6084179">Bethany... stop her...</string>
  <string id="6084180">Sister, help me!</string>
  <string id="6084181">Let go... of... my... brother!</string>
  <string id="6084184">Anders... make her... stop!</string>
  <string id="6084185">Anders, stop her!</string>
  <string id="6084186">Let go... of my friends!</string>
  <string id="6084189">Merrill... make Idunna... stop!</string>
  <string id="6084190">Merrill, do something!</string>
  <string id="6084191">This ends... Now!</string>
  <string id="6084196">Wh-What are you doing? Stop that. Stop that now!</string>
  <string id="6084202">How? How?</string>
  <string id="6084205">What? How did she do that? Bleeding ancestors, I feel like a fool.</string>
  <string id="6084208">I'm free... That damn bitch! But how...?</string>
  <string id="6084211">That was... unpleasant. How...?</string>
  <string id="6084214">Blood magic. It must be.</string>
  <string id="6084217">Maybe we can find answers somewhere around here. And then a cold shower.</string>
  <string id="6084218">Let's search her things. I bet she's got more secrets.</string>
  <string id="6084219">Search her room. We need to know what's going on.</string>
  <string id="6084220">She used blood magic against me. I didn't expect it to be so... powerful.</string>
  <string id="6084223">We should search for answers.</string>
  <string id="6084224">I've got the mother of all hangovers. I really hate blood mages.</string>
  <string id="6084227">We should search the room. Maybe we'll learn who she's working with.</string>
  <string id="6084228">She would have made a powerful magister. But the burial shroud suits her better.</string>
  <string id="6084231">We should look around.</string>
  <string id="6084232">Let's see what other secrets you've got...</string>
  <string id="6084235">I will not... be toyed with. </string>
  <string id="6084236">You can't control me.</string>
  <string id="6084237">How did you...? Oh, shit!</string>
  <string id="6084240">Spare me, messere!</string>
  <string id="6084241">What foul magic was that?</string>
  <string id="6084242">How did you do that?</string>
  <string id="6084243">You're going to answer all my questions. And if there's even a hint of magic...</string>
  <string id="6084244">Tell me everything. Now.</string>
  <string id="6084245">You're just too dangerous. You have to die.</string>
  <string id="6084246">No mercy for you.</string>
  <string id="6084249">We should just do what she says.</string>
  <string id="6084252">Maybe... Maybe you should be nicer to her.</string>
  <string id="6084255">She may not know anything.</string>
  <string id="6084261">Sorry about that. I don't know what I was thinking.</string>
  <string id="6084262">I'm so sorry! I don't know what came over me.</string>
  <string id="6084263">I don't know. Be careful.</string>
  <string id="6084267">Blood and desire, in equal measure. An art I learned from... elsewhere.</string>
  <string id="6084275">They will be protected.</string>
  <string id="6084291">What are we waiting around for? Let's go break stuff in my brother's house until we unhaunt it!</string>
  <string id="6084292">Hey... is that music? Where is that coming from?</string>
  <string id="6084305">Gate Guard</string>
  <string id="6084310">I request an audience with the Arishok.</string>
  <string id="6084313">He will allow it, but not in this number.</string>
  <string id="6084316">I will only bring my friend here and a small complement of my guard. Is that few enough?</string>
  <string id="6084319">It is.</string>
  <string id="6084325">Enter.</string>
  <string id="6084331">The gates are closed by order of the Arishok.</string>
  <string id="6084334">Where's Aveline? I bet she could order them to open up.</string>
  <string id="6084340">One of the Dalish, a woman named Variel, is a friend of his. I suggest speaking with her first.</string>
  <string id="6084345">You wouldn't know it, but Bartrand was a sentimentalist. This came from our estate in Orzammar.</string>
  <string id="6084348">When I was seven, I knocked over one of Mother's plates and broke it. My brother yelled at me for an hour. </string>
  <string id="6084349">Your collusion in the Chantry has ensured I am hated whatever I do. How much pain will you allow to selfishly deny the Qun?</string>
  <string id="6084353">He's nothing but a murderer, a thief, and a liar.</string>
  <string id="6084355">Nobody lies to me, Nuncio. Just when were you going to tell me that you were a Crow?</string>
  <string id="6084356">I let your assassin go. Was I not supposed to do that?</string>
  <string id="6084360">Will everyone please just step back!</string>
  <string id="6084366">My mother's in labor! The baby's come early. Can anyone help her?</string>
  <string id="6084369">I'll send word to the healer, but—</string>
  <string id="6084372">My son's hurt bad. Cart overturned on him in the blasted Bone Pit.</string>
  <string id="6084381">Everyone in your turn. I promise, we have donations coming in. There will be food and medicine for all of you.</string>
  <string id="6084387">We serve everyone here—no one came from Ferelden without trouble.</string>
  <string id="6084390">But I can't give priority to anyone who's already found work and lodging.</string>
  <string id="6084398">Look at all this.</string>
  <string id="6084401">Magic is a cancer in the heart of our land, just as it was in the time of Andraste.</string>
  <string id="6084404">And like her we are left with no choice but to purify it with fire and blood.</string>
  <string id="6084405">You got what you wanted. It's done.</string>
  <string id="6084406">It's over.</string>
  <string id="6084407">You almost sound as if you're happy to do it.</string>
  <string id="6084408">You're enjoying this?</string>
  <string id="6084409">Strange way to treat a sick patient.</string>
  <string id="6084410">Death is an odd cure.</string>
  <string id="6084411">And me? Have you forgotten I use magic, as well?</string>
  <string id="6084412">I'm a mage, remember?</string>
  <string id="6084413">And here we are, Champion, at long last.</string>
  <string id="6084414">I was afraid you were going to let everyone else do your fighting.</string>
  <string id="6084415">Finally.</string>
  <string id="6084416">Not at all.</string>
  <string id="6084419">I am here to see order restored. What happens to you now is your own doing.</string>
  <string id="6084422">You'll pay for what you've done here.</string>
  <string id="6084423">You're a monster.</string>
  <string id="6084424">I will be rewarded for what I've done here, in this world and the next!</string>
  <string id="6084427">I have done nothing but perform my duty. What happens to you now is your own doing.</string>
  <string id="6084430">I imagine you've wanted to be rid of me for some time.</string>
  <string id="6084431">Been waiting for this?</string>
  <string id="6084432">I bear you no ill will. You've done this to yourself.</string>
  <string id="6084435">You were never part of this Circle, and I tolerated that, but in defending them you've chosen to share their fate.</string>
  <string id="6084438">You are no mage, but in supporting them you've elected to share their fate.</string>
  <string id="6084441">Knight-Commander, I thought we intended to arrest the Champion.</string>
  <string id="6084442">You should have told him where he could shove that broken dish.</string>
  <string id="6084443">You let him push you around?</string>
  <string id="6084444">This was made by the artisans of House Saldras! The clay was from the Aedros Atuna river, which never sees the sun!</string>
  <string id="6084450">Blind Alley</string>
  <string id="6084461">What did you just do?</string>
  <string id="6084468">Yes, it was blood magic, but I know what I'm doing. The spirit helped us, didn't it?</string>
  <string id="6084469">Call it what it is. You summoned a demon.</string>
  <string id="6084470">The demon, you mean.</string>
  <string id="6084471">The barrier is gone, certainly.</string>
  <string id="6084472">It did help us.</string>
  <string id="6084473">Sure, demons are very helpful... right up until they take your mind and turn you into a monster.</string>
  <string id="6084474">They don't keep helping.</string>
  <string id="6084477">Merchants Guild ledgers. Sighs Dwarves fighting over whose ancestors were the dwarfiest, whose gold is the shiniest...</string>
  <string id="6084480">Blood magic, then?</string>
  <string id="6084483">Yes, messere. Please don't kill me.</string>
  <string id="6084484">Tarohne put me here. To send biddable templar recruits to the sanctuary. Three Spear Alley, in the Undercity.</string>
  <string id="6084487">I enchanted Wilmod and Keran weeks ago. But after they left these walls, I know not what came of them.</string>
  <string id="6084494">If you've coin to spare, we won't turn it down. Donations go in the box up front.</string>
  <string id="6084495">Ah, so Zevran told you, did he? It really doesn't matter. This time his Warden isn't here to protect him.</string>
  <string id="6084499">Anything else?</string>
  <string id="6084500">Only Fereldan Grey Warden I've heard of is sitting on the throne.</string>
  <string id="6084503">Only Fereldan Grey Warden I've heard of died to save us all from the Archdemon. Fat lot they care here.</string>
  <string id="6084506">Only Fereldan Grey Warden I've heard of slew the Archdemon to save us all. Fat lot they care here.</string>
  <string id="6084509">We're out of the Blight's path now. Why would you need a Warden?</string>
  <string id="6084512">The healer was one of them once, wasn't he? A Warden?</string>
  <string id="6084515">Well, he's not now. And busy enough without answering fool questions about it.</string>
  <string id="6084516">Who are you protecting?</string>
  <string id="6084517">Why so defensive?</string>
  <string id="6084518">Then I'll only ask very smart questions.</string>
  <string id="6084519">I won't bother him.</string>
  <string id="6084520">Where is this healer?</string>
  <string id="6084521">That's who I need.</string>
  <string id="6084522">Look around. We don't often get customers with actual coin to spend.</string>
  <string id="6084527">I do not joke, serah.</string>
  <string id="6084530">You see what our people face in Kirkwall. They have no jobs, no homes. Most can barely buy bread.</string>
  <string id="6084533">This healer, he serves them without thought for coin. He's closed their wounds, delivered their children.</string>
  <string id="6084536">He's a good man. I won't lose him to the blighted templars.</string>
  <string id="6084537">You mean he's a mage?</string>
  <string id="6084538">Lose him to the templars?</string>
  <string id="6084539">Would I stick my neck out for some purveyor of hensbane and leeches?</string>
  <string id="6084542">He doesn't want to be locked in the Gallows just for using the gifts the Maker gave him.</string>
  <string id="6084543">Your healer is in no danger from me.</string>
  <string id="6084544">I mean him no harm.</string>
  <string id="6084545">Tell me he's got killer eyes and a nice smile, I'll marry him on the spot.</string>
  <string id="6084546">He sounds too good to be true.</string>
  <string id="6084547">No one's that selfless. He's probably got bodies hidden in his basement.</string>
  <string id="6084548">He sounds too good to be true.</string>
  <string id="6084549">I wouldn't worry so much about his safety. Worry about yours.</string>
  <string id="6084550">Tell me where he is. Or else.</string>
  <string id="6084551">Leave Area</string>
  <string id="6084555">I'm preparing for the worst. The very worst. This may require absorbent linens.</string>
  <string id="6084677">Madness. Madness!</string>
  <string id="6084680">It certainly is.</string>
  <string id="6084683">Yes, Excellency.</string>
  <string id="6084686">That's a word for it.</string>
  <string id="6084689">Chantry involvement... even if they are fringe elements. It could not be worse.</string>
  <string id="6084692">You killed them. All of them?</string>
  <string id="6084693">This group, at least, is crippled.</string>
  <string id="6084694">All that were here.</string>
  <string id="6084695">A mother serving the grand cleric allowed this to happen.</string>
  <string id="6084696">I suspect a mother of helping.</string>
  <string id="6084697">Are you quite sure? She held a blade with them? Told them to fight you?</string>
  <string id="6084700">No, I cannot say that.</string>
  <string id="6084703">Of course not. A blasted mother...</string>
  <string id="6084706">You have no idea the storm these allegations would cause. It would destroy what support I do have.</string>
  <string id="6084707">I have had trouble with her before. She is... slippery.</string>
  <string id="6084708">It will not go away.</string>
  <string id="6084709">I understand.</string>
  <string id="6084712">This may have scared her off. She claimed this was not her intention.</string>
  <string id="6084713">She will lay low for a while.</string>
  <string id="6084714">That is something.</string>
  <string id="6084717">I will make my inquiries. Gently. And you should be careful in your associations. For now, we have other problems.</string>
  <string id="6084720">So many Qunari. But you killed everyone responsible? All of them?</string>
  <string id="6084721">To a man.</string>
  <string id="6084722">Every last one.</string>
  <string id="6084723">This group is crippled. There may be others, though.</string>
  <string id="6084724">It's hard to kill hatred.</string>
  <string id="6084725">Then that, at least, is something. Not that it matters now.</string>
  <string id="6084728">We have the delegate but... I can't return the bodies to the Qunari in this state.</string>
  <string id="6084731">Serah Hawke, you know the Arishok. What should I do?</string>
  <string id="6084732">Perhaps we can disguise the abuse. Fire will hide the severity.</string>
  <string id="6084733">Burn them to hide the torture.</string>
  <string id="6084734">What choice do we have? Guards.</string>
  <string id="6084737">Hiding this would only make it worse.</string>
  <string id="6084738">Do not hide it. He'll know.</string>
  <string id="6084739">It would, wouldn't it? I am losing my sense of how to balance this nightmare.</string>
  <string id="6084742">I appreciate your help in this matter. As bad as this is, it could have been much worse without you.</string>
  <string id="6084745">Kirkwall owes you. I owe you.</string>
  <string id="6084747">Leave Area</string>
  <string id="6084748">Leave Area</string>
  <string id="6084749">I can hardly blame him.</string>
  <string id="6084750">That seems reasonable.</string>
  <string id="6084751">If this mage is an apostate, the templars will find him.</string>
  <string id="6084754">No mage should suffer for an accident of birth.</string>
  <string id="6084757">I suppose it isn't my secret to keep. Anders has certainly been free enough with his services.</string>
  <string id="6084760">Refugees in Darktown know—to find the healer, look for the lit lantern.</string>
  <string id="6084763">If you have need enough, Anders will be within.</string>
  <string id="6084766">Qunari</string>
  <string id="6084771">Anders's Base</string>
  <string id="6084859">Please, let me live. It's not my fault. It was all Tarohne's idea.</string>
  <string id="6084860">Tell me about Tarohne.</string>
  <string id="6084861">Tarohne?</string>
  <string id="6084862">She put me up to this. She said we can recreate the ancient Imperium. That mages can rule again, not serve.</string>
  <string id="6084865">She says the templars cannot hold against us if we stand up and fight.</string>
  <string id="6084866">This base of yours—how many other mages are there? Any other defenses?</string>
  <string id="6084867">Tell me about the sanctuary.</string>
  <string id="6084868">People go in and out all the time. Sometimes a handful, sometimes more.</string>
  <string id="6084871">There are traps. Magical traps. There's a hidden switch at the front—it turns them off.</string>
  <string id="6084874">Th-That's all I know.</string>
  <string id="6084875">No, no!</string>
  <string id="6084881">The templars are coming for you. No more of your tricks!</string>
  <string id="6084882">You go to the templars.</string>
  <string id="6084895">We must purge the sanctuary. The mages must be dealt with.</string>
  <string id="6084896">Lets go to the sanctuary and find Tarohne. I want answers.</string>
  <string id="6084897">One blood mage down. Who knows how many more to go.</string>
  <string id="6084898">We must go to the sanctuary before they learn what we've done here.</string>
  <string id="6084899">We need to go to the sanctuary. Some blood mage bitch needs to pay for this.</string>
  <string id="6084900">Next stop the sanctuary. And some answers.</string>
  <string id="6084909">I never understood how he could stand it. Five minutes with them, and I need a strong drink.</string>
  <string id="6084910">Do those records tell us anything?</string>
  <string id="6084911">Anything useful there?</string>
  <string id="6084912">Bartrand wagered everything on the expedition. Everything, for the chance to escape the guild.</string>
  <string id="6084919">Sounds like he doesn't want to go with you.</string>
  <string id="6084920">Leave him alone.</string>
  <string id="6084921">A little rough for a rescue, don't you think?</string>
  <string id="6084922">What's going on here?</string>
  <string id="6084983">Sometimes that is necessary.</string>
  <string id="6084984">Make enough money, and the guild doesn't matter anymore. You're free... damnation. Let's keep going.</string>
  <string id="6085011">Like you avenged the viscount's son? It was not right then, and it's not right now.</string>
  <string id="6085031">Dalish Camp</string>
  <string id="6085034">You had him, and you let him go?</string>
  <string id="6085040">The Arishok will take no visitors. He is considering the demands of the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6085041">The Arishok will see no one. He has begun preparations.</string>
  <string id="6085042">The Arishok is through with the insults of this city.</string>
  <string id="6085043">As a respected enemy, I offer you this: leave this city.</string>
  <string id="6085047">You go ahead—I have something I should do.</string>
  <string id="6085048">No time for distractions, Isabela. I have business here.</string>
  <string id="6085049">I'm going to see the Arishok.</string>
  <string id="6085050">Well, you can go right ahead.</string>
  <string id="6085054">I'll put it off, if that's what you want, but I need a reason.</string>
  <string id="6085055">I can wait, but why?</string>
  <string id="6085056">It's nothing, really. I'm sure we have plenty to do, and I don't want to interrupt. Too much.</string>
  <string id="6085081">You are allowed, basra, until the Arishok declares otherwise. </string>
  <string id="6085082">Enter if you must.</string>
  <string id="6085083">All are forbidden. Except you—for now.</string>
  <string id="6085084">Yes it is.</string>
  <string id="6085100">Laughs As it happens, he's got the eyes. But I've never seen him smile.</string>
  <string id="6085103">It's always seemed like he must have lost even more than the rest of us.</string>
  <string id="6085106">I suppose you can seek him out. Anders certainly hasn't turned anyone else away. Look for the lit lantern in Darktown.</string>
  <string id="6085109">He's certainly grim enough. I've never seen a man carry more sorrows.</string>
  <string id="6085110">Leave Area</string>
  <string id="6085119">You go on ahead. I have... another appointment.</string>
  <string id="6085122">Go without me. I have to see a man about a dog.</string>
  <string id="6085125">You go ahead, I just remembered... something.</string>
  <string id="6085128">Oh, you don't want me in there. Female troubles.</string>
  <string id="6085131">Is that the hour? Maker, I am tired. Go on without me.</string>
  <string id="6085134">Go without me. I need a stiff one and a drink.</string>
  <string id="6085137">You just go ahead. I have to pamper a kitty.</string>
  <string id="6085140">I'll just leave you to it. Someone has to tend the horses.</string>
  <string id="6085143">I think I left someone back at the Hanged Man.</string>
  <string id="6085146">Hey, I think I knew that man, back in Antiva! Bye!</string>
  <string id="6085166">Get a move on! Get out!</string>
  <string id="6085167">Enough stammering. Beat it!</string>
  <string id="6085176">He said there would be people looking for him, and to tell anyone who asked where he was.</string>
  <string id="6085177">Why would he give away his position?</string>
  <string id="6085178">He'll just give himself up?</string>
  <string id="6085179">I don't trust this. No one would allow themselves to be cornered in a cave without a plan.</string>
  <string id="6085180">You're setting us up.</string>
  <string id="6085213">He said he didn't want to endanger our people by asking us to lie for him.</string>
  <string id="6085217">He's doing nothing of the sort. He didn't want to endanger us, so he asked us not to get involved.</string>
  <string id="6085228">There will be a reckoning for this. A plot within the order, beneath my very nose!</string>
  <string id="6085232">The conspiracy against you has been put down.</string>
  <string id="6085235">I'm not sure if you're aware, but a lot of people in this city don't like you.</string>
  <string id="6085238">The conspirators are dead.</string>
  <string id="6085241">And? What is Orsino's plan? He is part of this conspiracy, is he not?</string>
  <string id="6085242">The first enchanter had no role in this.</string>
  <string id="6085243">Orsino is blameless.</string>
  <string id="6085244">Cullen would agree with you, it seems. He claims a templar turned on me and the mages only followed.</string>
  <string id="6085247">Ooh, I'd love to be a fly on the wall when you and Orsino get together.</string>
  <string id="6085248">I'll let you two work it out.</string>
  <string id="6085249">Cullen tells me the first enchanter was not behind this, that one of our own led this scheme.</string>
  <string id="6085252">I do not believe it.</string>
  <string id="6085255">If you did not find proof, it means only that Orsino hid his tracks well. Who else was involved?</string>
  <string id="6085256">The templar Thrask, the templar Keran, the templar Samson. The mage Grace, the mage Alain. I do not know the others.</string>
  <string id="6085257">I'll name names.</string>
  <string id="6085258">The templar Thrask, the templar Keran, the templar Samson. The mage Grace. I do not know the others.</string>
  <string id="6085259">I'll name names.</string>
  <string id="6085260">The templar Thrask, the templar Keran. The mage Grace, the mage Alain. I do not know the others.</string>
  <string id="6085261">I'll name names.</string>
  <string id="6085262">The templar Thrask, the templar Keran. The mage Grace. I do not know the others.</string>
  <string id="6085263">I'll name names.</string>
  <string id="6085264">Thrask? He was a good man. That he would be influenced by blood magic is... unfortunate.</string>
  <string id="6085267">It's over. If you continue to chase ghosts, you only give people more reason to think you're mad.</string>
  <string id="6085268">You must let this go.</string>
  <string id="6085269">Many are assumed to be mad... right up until the point they are proven correct.</string>
  <string id="6085272">Still... without proof of Orsino's direct involvement, the grand cleric will never believe as I do.</string>
  <string id="6085275">Thank you, Champion. You have done a fine service for your city.</string>
  <string id="6085276">You will never accept that you're wrong! No wonder so many of your men want you gone.</string>
  <string id="6085277">You're mad!</string>
  <string id="6085278">You're already convinced he's guilty, even if he's not.</string>
  <string id="6085279">You're paranoid.</string>
  <string id="6085280">So Orsino has managed to convince you, as well?</string>
  <string id="6085283">I was hoping you, of all people, might be above the influence of blood magic.</string>
  <string id="6085286">Go. It appears I must deal with this on my own.</string>
  <string id="6085292">Her Grace must realize the threat we face.</string>
  <string id="6085296">You should take care what friends you keep, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6085300">Champion. It seems you are the only one who still responds to my summons.</string>
  <string id="6085303">The mages are responsible, but they have blinded the grand cleric and even those who wear the sun-shield to the truth.</string>
  <string id="6085306">You would think Orsino preaching treason in the market evidence enough, but it seems only you have the sense to see it.</string>
  <string id="6085307">Orsino preaches treason in the market, and yet still more evidence is demanded. It seems beyond reason.</string>
  <string id="6085324">I have seen the evidence—the muddied boots, missing potions. Mages are sneaking out at night for their dark rituals.</string>
  <string id="6085327">Of course. Muddy boots mean blood magic. That's incontrovertible. Good mages wipe their feet first.</string>
  <string id="6085332">The mages are bolder since Orsino spoke out. They are sneaking out of the tower and deceiving my men.</string>
  <string id="6085335">I know how it sounds. Claiming I am irrational has become the latest sport, it seems.</string>
  <string id="6085336">That doesn't sound like very compelling evidence.</string>
  <string id="6085337">There must be more to this.</string>
  <string id="6085338">Yet mages have indeed gone missing only to re-appear later, their absences unreported.</string>
  <string id="6085341">And how, but with blood magic, could they convince my oath-sworn men to lie to my face?</string>
  <string id="6085344">Maybe I can shed some light on this for you.</string>
  <string id="6085345">How can I help?</string>
  <string id="6085346">Thank you, Champion. I knew I could count on you.</string>
  <string id="6085356">I need to bring hard evidence before Grand Cleric Elthina. It is the only way she will believe I am not motivated by hatred.</string>
  <string id="6085367">And what if someone could have prevented what happened to your mother, Champion?</string>
  <string id="6085375">Then I am wrong. I would never ask you to lie, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6085381">One of my loyal men has brought me word of a meeting place the mages travel to at night, a small square in Hightown.</string>
  <string id="6085384">You can go there without arousing suspicion, whereas I cannot.</string>
  <string id="6085390">I appreciate your assistance, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6085391">As if it were too much to ask that the city be kept safe from magic. Orsino is a fool!</string>
  <string id="6085392">She was a good person and didn't deserve her fate.</string>
  <string id="6085393">I'm sorry about Marethari.</string>
  <string id="6085394">I don't need anything from the Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6085395">You can't help me.</string>
  <string id="6085396">I'm always amazed by the beauty of the Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6085397">Your eyes are stunning.</string>
  <string id="6085415">Champion.</string>
  <string id="6085419">Your mage-templar group was conspiring to overthrow Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6085422">I have a sudden deep regret I interfered...</string>
  <string id="6085425">You know, I was half-convinced Meredith had engineered the whole thing, to trick me into incriminating myself.</string>
  <string id="6085426">Thrask admitted to leading the group.</string>
  <string id="6085427">Meredith was not involved.</string>
  <string id="6085428">Perhaps I've exaggerated the depths of her madness. But if she's not there yet, she will be soon. </string>
  <string id="6085431">The only question is, once it's clear she cannot lead, will there be anyone left to oppose her?</string>
  <string id="6085434">If Meredith stays in charge, she'll run Kirkwall into the ground.</string>
  <string id="6085435">She must be overthrown.</string>
  <string id="6085436">Speak softly, friend. There is nowhere safe to say those words.</string>
  <string id="6085439">But be assured, you are not the only one thinking them.</string>
  <string id="6085442">Please accept this as my thanks. It will be of more value to you right now than my friendship.</string>
  <string id="6085448">Do not jump to any conclusions about this group. I only wish to know their purpose.</string>
  <string id="6085452">Meredith has no need of your services here, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6085456">Thank you for coming, Champion. Few will associate with me now that I am the focus of Meredith's ire.</string>
  <string id="6085459">Which leaves me in a difficult position. She is not entirely wrong.</string>
  <string id="6085462">Inform the criers! A miracle has occurred!</string>
  <string id="6085465">I know some of my people are using dangerous means to oppose her, but I cannot seek the templars' aid without making every mage a target.</string>
  <string id="6085466">What are they doing?</string>
  <string id="6085467">Dangerous means?</string>
  <string id="6085468">All I know is numerous mages have left the Circle at night, sometimes for days at a time.</string>
  <string id="6085471">I'd rather not follow our knight-commander by leaping to the worst possible conclusion, but the idea of blood magic has crossed my mind.</string>
  <string id="6085472">She does like to add one and one and get eleven, doesn't she?</string>
  <string id="6085473">Meredith is a bit overzealous.</string>
  <string id="6085474">Sometimes a hundred and eleven.</string>
  <string id="6085477">You need some assistance against traitors in your ranks?</string>
  <string id="6085478">How can I help?</string>
  <string id="6085479">Traitors? Perhaps. Rebels? Certainly.</string>
  <string id="6085482">I don't know if they seek congress with demons, or merely a walk in the moonlight.</string>
  <string id="6085485">Walking's not so bad. Even mages need exercise!</string>
  <string id="6085488">You're underestimating our knight-commander. She'd probably kill the whole city, just to be safe.</string>
  <string id="6085489">Meredith can be overzealous.</string>
  <string id="6085490">She might take on the entire Free Marches.</string>
  <string id="6085493">I have heard rumors, whispers, of a meeting tonight in Hightown.</string>
  <string id="6085496">Fear of the templars doesn't justify going soft on blood mages.</string>
  <string id="6085497">That's no excuse.</string>
  <string id="6085498">I don't know if they're using blood magic or just visiting their families.</string>
  <string id="6085501">All I know is that a meeting is happening tonight in Hightown.</string>
  <string id="6085504">I would go myself, but should I leave the tower without permission, Meredith would call it proof of my involvement.</string>
  <string id="6085505">I'll see what they're up to. There's no point in involving the templars.</string>
  <string id="6085506">Let's resolve this quietly.</string>
  <string id="6085507">Thank you. Your support has been a life-line for me.</string>
  <string id="6085510">So I shouldn't slit my wrists and dance naked under the moonlight just to fit in?</string>
  <string id="6085511">What if she catches me?</string>
  <string id="6085512">If that's what you intend, perhaps I'll join you after all...</string>
  <string id="6085515">I would... not recommend it.</string>
  <string id="6085518">Whatever they're doing, I'll put an end to it.</string>
  <string id="6085519">I'll stop them.</string>
  <string id="6085520">Use discretion. I would rather not deny my mages what small freedoms they can find.</string>
  <string id="6085523">If they break the law, we will not look away, Enchanter.</string>
  <string id="6085526">Just learn the nature of this meeting. You needn't interrupt unless you find proof of something sinister.</string>
  <string id="6085529">I pray not, or Meredith will have what she needs to justify the Right of Annulment.</string>
  <string id="6085535">This is a difficult time for Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6085536">If you are trying to initiate... something, don't bother. I'm not interested in a shemlen.</string>
  <string id="6085539">Act 2 Prime Suspect</string>
  <string id="6085540">Act 2 Prime Suspect</string>
  <string id="6085541">It isn't your fault. It's Merrill's.</string>
  <string id="6085544">I... she wasn't...</string>
  <string id="6085547">Marethari tried to save her and look what happened.</string>
  <string id="6085551">Where is Keran?</string>
  <string id="6085570">You, Anders... and Justice. That must be exciting!</string>
  <string id="6085573">As they say, two's company, but three is better.</string>
  <string id="6085574">Keep your nose out of my affairs.</string>
  <string id="6085575">None of your business.</string>
  <string id="6085577">Varnell's Hideout.</string>
  <string id="6085578">Varnell's Hideout</string>
  <string id="6085612">I enjoy being with Anders. And that's all I'm going to say about it.</string>
  <string id="6085613">I like Anders.</string>
  <string id="6085614">I don't think whoever made that claim had a Fade spirit in mind.</string>
  <string id="6085615">Not with Justice.</string>
  <string id="6085616">No? You don't like his spear of righteousness then?</string>
  <string id="6085652">Are you real? You've got to get out of here before it comes back!</string>
  <string id="6085676">We know about Anders. What about Justice? Does he not get involved?</string>
  <string id="6085679">Or perhaps he thinks you're too good of a person and isn't willing to smite you?</string>
  <string id="6085682">That would be a shame, wouldn't it? Everyone deserves a good smiting, now and then.</string>
  <string id="6085685">I could use one right this minute.</string>
  <string id="6085688">Oh, fine. Prude.</string>
  <string id="6085694">Serah, they're in the camp! Help!</string>
  <string id="6085695">Reinforcements! Get ready!</string>
  <string id="6085696">No! Release me at once!</string>
  <string id="6085715">Demons are just spirits. Like honor or joy. It's not their fault they are what they are.</string>
  <string id="6085716">Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6085717">Well... yes. But that won't happen. I know how to defend myself.</string>
  <string id="6085729">Did you release Ketojan to the Qunari, or fight to keep him from them?</string>
  <string id="6085730">Give the Qunari mage back to the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6085731">Release Ketojan</string>
  <string id="6085732">Fight to keep Ketojan from the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6085733">Fight</string>
  <string id="6085734">Go Back.</string>
  <string id="6085735">Go back.</string>
  <string id="6085738">I've never seen so many people in one place before. It seems so lonely.</string>
  <string id="6085739">This is what city life is like.</string>
  <string id="6085740">Get used to it.</string>
  <string id="6085741">You already know me. You'll make other friends soon enough.</string>
  <string id="6085742">You're not alone.</string>
  <string id="6085743">Working your way up will be fun! All right, that was a lie. It won't be fun.</string>
  <string id="6085744">Think of it as an adventure!</string>
  <string id="6085745">Whatever you think you are, I still care about you.</string>
  <string id="6085746">You're still my friend.</string>
  <string id="6085749">You're just afraid of being anything else.</string>
  <string id="6085750">No, you're not.</string>
  <string id="6085760">I don't know how to be anything else.</string>
  <string id="6085763">Rubbish. Stop making excuses for yourself. You're a better person than you think.</string>
  <string id="6085767">Select a plot point:</string>
  <string id="6085768">Start</string>
  <string id="6085769">Start</string>
  <string id="6085770">Conversation with Emeric</string>
  <string id="6085771">Conversation with Emeric</string>
  <string id="6085772">Confrontation with Gascard</string>

  <string id="6085775">Gascard Killed</string>
  <string id="6085776">Gascard released</string>
  <string id="6085777">Gascard released</string>
  <string id="6085780">Fine, Hawke. You're probably right about that too.</string>
  <string id="6085783">The Qunari usually arrive as conquerors. Odd that this has gone on so long.</string>
  <string id="6085784">Do you fear a war?</string>
  <string id="6085785">Very, and I have no interest in antagonizing them. That is partially why I suffer being a messenger today.</string>
  <string id="6085788">A treaty exists and it has been honored. Although...</string>
  <string id="6085791">You have doubts.</string>
  <string id="6085794">They claim they're waiting for a second ship, but it has been three years. They want something else.</string>
  <string id="6085803">You're right, I suppose.</string>
  <string id="6085804">I... thank you.</string>
  <string id="6085805">Some adventurer I am. Barely set out, and I'm already daunted.</string>
  <string id="6085812">Did you side with Varnell or the Qunari?</string>
  <string id="6085813">You done killed those blasted oxmen dead.</string>
  <string id="6085814">Varnell</string>
  <string id="6085815">You killed that cruel Templar and his followers.</string>
  <string id="6085816">Qunari</string>
  <string id="6085827">Thank you for everything. For all your help.</string>
  <string id="6085830">Will you come visit me? Not now, of course. But maybe later? I could use a friend.</string>
  <string id="6085831">I think I can manage that.</string>
  <string id="6085832">I will.</string>
  <string id="6085833">I'd like that, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6085834">I will.</string>
  <string id="6085835">Of course. But only because you used that you kicked my puppy voice.</string>
  <string id="6085836">I will.</string>
  <string id="6085837">Thank you. I'm thanking you too much, aren't I? I mean it, though.</string>
  <string id="6085840">I have enough problems without being seen with a blood mage.</string>
  <string id="6085841">I don't think so.</string>
  <string id="6085842">I'm not sure that's a good idea.</string>
  <string id="6085843">I don't think so.</string>
  <string id="6085844">You should probably stick with elves. And demon-summoning blood mages.</string>
  <string id="6085845">I don't think so.</string>
  <string id="6085846">I understand. It was good of you to bring me this far. I owe you.</string>
  <string id="6085849">And I will repay you, somehow. Dareth shiral.</string>
  <string id="6085852">It must have been hard to give up the relic, and I appreciate it.</string>
  <string id="6085855">Whatever comes, you have my support.</string>
  <string id="6085858">Well, perhaps it's time to stop hiding, and I do miss the trouble we used to get into.</string>
  <string id="6085861">Did you send the Arishok the maimed bodies, or did you try to disguise what Varnell had done by burning the bodies?</string>
  <string id="6085862">You sent the maimed bodies back to the Arishok.</string>
  <string id="6085863">Maimed</string>
  <string id="6085864">You disguised Varnell's torture by burning the bodies before you sent them back to the Arishok.</string>
  <string id="6085865">Burned</string>
  <string id="6085866">Go back.</string>
  <string id="6085867">Go back</string>
  <string id="6085870">Don't waste my time with your lies! Tell me where it is!</string>
  <string id="6085871">Not quite.</string>
  <string id="6085874">Happy? I would prefer we lived in a world without such sickness, where such madness is unnecessary.</string>
  <string id="6085877">But we do not. Even this battle is not yet over.</string>
  <string id="6085880">Sometimes a limb must be amputated to save a life. Unpleasant, but necessary.</string>
  <string id="6085883">And my surgery here is not yet done.</string>
  <string id="6085886">I have not.</string>
  <string id="6085889">I am beginning to wonder just how large your part in all this actually was.</string>
  <string id="6085892">An apostate come into our city, gathering power and influence? A sudden hero of the people?</string>
  <string id="6085895">A refugee come to our city with an apostate sister, gathering power and influence without any accounting?</string>
  <string id="6085898">How can I trust that the mighty Champion of Kirkwall is not a worse threat to this city than the Circle?</string>
  <string id="6085899">Is helping you destroy the Circle not proof enough?</string>
  <string id="6085900">I supported you.</string>
  <string id="6085901">Proof of what? Your lies? Proof that you are more clever even than Orsino?</string>
  <string id="6085904">You're seeing threats where none exist.</string>
  <string id="6085905">You're paranoid.</string>
  <string id="6085906">If you want to see a threat to this city, look in the mirror.</string>
  <string id="6085907">Look who's talking.</string>
  <string id="6085908">Hmph. Just the sort of misdirection I would expect from you.</string>
  <string id="6085911">The people of Kirkwall will mourn your loss, but I will tell them you died battling the mages. A righteous cause.</string>
  <string id="6085916">You will do as I command, Cullen.</string>
  <string id="6085919">No. I defended you when Thrask started whispering you were mad. But this is too far.</string>
  <string id="6085922">I will not allow insubordination! We must stay true to our path!</string>
  <string id="6085925">Andraste's dimpled buttcheeks!</string>
  <string id="6085928">You recognize it, do you not? Pure lyrium, taken from the Deep Roads. The dwarf charged a great deal for his prize.</string>
  <string id="6085929">Turning the idol into a fancy sword won't save you.</string>
  <string id="6085930">It won't help you.</string>
  <string id="6085931">The idol poisoned Bartrand's mind in the end.</string>
  <string id="6085932">It killed him, Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6085933">He was weak, whereas I am not!</string>
  <string id="6085936">It seems a lot more sword-like than I remember.</string>
  <string id="6085937">That's the idol?</string>
  <string id="6085938">All of you, I want him dead!</string>
  <string id="6085941">All of you, I want her dead!</string>
  <string id="6085950">No! My brother defended us! Defended you! I won't turn on him now!</string>
  <string id="6085953">No! My sister defended us! Defended you! I won't turn on her now!</string>
  <string id="6085959">No! I won't kill my brother for you!</string>
  <string id="6085962">No! I won't kill my sister for you!</string>
  <string id="6085965">You dare!</string>
  <string id="6085968">Enough, Knight-Commander—I'm ending this. I should have done so long ago.</string>
  <string id="6085971">But I don't need any of you! I will protect this city myself!</string>
  <string id="6085974">You'll have to go through me.</string>
  <string id="6085977">Idiot boy! Just like all the others!</string>
  <string id="6085980">How long has she been like this?</string>
  <string id="6085983">If she plays with that any more, she's going to go blind.</string>
  <string id="6085986">She's lost it. Just like Bartrand.</string>
  <string id="6085989">She's clearly lost her mind!</string>
  <string id="6085993">If you want answers, don't interrupt.</string>
  <string id="6085994">Let her talk.</string>
  <string id="6085995">Take it easy, Varric. She's telling us what she can.</string>
  <string id="6085996">Calm down.</string>
  <string id="6085997">I didn't exactly want to stay for dinner, but I think we've got a few minutes to hear her out.</string>
  <string id="6085998">You in a hurry, Varric?</string>
  <string id="6086002">Blessed are those who stand before the corrupt and the wicked and do not falter!</string>
  <string id="6086005">This is what respect looks like, bas! Some of you will never earn it!</string>
  <string id="6086011">Screams</string>
  <string id="6086014">Maker, your servant begs you for the strength to defeat this evil!</string>
  <string id="6086026">I will not be defeated!</string>
  <string id="6086029">Maker! Aid your humble servant!</string>
  <string id="6086035">Screams</string>
  <string id="6086036">We did not make it easy. Three Qunari died defending it. Enough to impart a sense of worth.</string>
  <string id="6086039">How wonderful, more vessels for our experiments.</string>
  <string id="6086045">Perhaps the demons will find one of you suitable.</string>
  <string id="6086159">Is it... Is it over?</string>
  <string id="6086162">Keran?</string>
  <string id="6086165">Yes, that's my name. Oh thank the Maker, I thought He had abandoned me.</string>
  <string id="6086168">But is it only Keran? It could be Keran plus one. A very nasty plus one, at that.</string>
  <string id="6086169">Do not trust him. He is likely possessed.</string>
  <string id="6086170">So, when do we find out if this one's got a demon inside?</string>
  <string id="6086171">Do you think he's possessed?</string>
  <string id="6086172">Be careful, Hawke. He was influenced.</string>
  <string id="6086173">Watch yourself. He could still be possessed.</string>
  <string id="6086174">I... I don't know what they did to me. There were demons. My head...</string>
  <string id="6086177">I never... I never understood why people could be so terrified of mages.</string>
  <string id="6086180">Our family had two. You. Bethany.</string>
  <string id="6086183">But this... Andraste was right to warn against magic.</string>
  <string id="6086184">Of course, maniacs with swords and the Maker on their side have never hurt anyone. </string>
  <string id="6086185">Templars are just as bad.</string>
  <string id="6086186">Maybe they have a reason.</string>
  <string id="6086189">Tarohne made a choice to practice blood magic. Most mages are good people.</string>
  <string id="6086190">Magic is not the problem.</string>
  <string id="6086191">You don't think I know that?</string>
  <string id="6086194">It's just that I never really thought about their side. Now I see.</string>
  <string id="6086200">You think the templars should take me, Carver? Is that what you're saying?</string>
  <string id="6086201">No one is going to lock me up.</string>
  <string id="6086202">The cage has opened. Thank Andraste.</string>
  <string id="6086203">Merrill? You know something about this. Is he possessed?</string>
  <string id="6086204">Is he possessed, Merrill?</string>
  <string id="6086205">I don't know...</string>
  <string id="6086211">It's... It's clean. There is no scent of demons in his blood.</string>
  <string id="6086212">Well, there's one sure way.</string>
  <string id="6086218">Aaah! What was that about!</string>
  <string id="6086221">If there was a demon in there, it would have defended itself. Looks like he's clear.</string>
  <string id="6086239">What do you remember about how you got here?</string>
  <string id="6086240">What happened to you, Keran?</string>
  <string id="6086241">I... I was with a lady. And then things got fuzzy.</string>
  <string id="6086244">Nightmares, then. On fire for days, a demon laughing. The naked lady with her razor claws...  in my chest.</string>
  <string id="6086247">I'd wake and hear screams. Maybe my own?</string>
  <string id="6086250">I'm sorry, it's all a tangle in my head.</string>
  <string id="6086252">You may be possessed.</string>
  <string id="6086253">What? No! I'm not a mage. I can't—</string>
  <string id="6086256">Demons can possess anyone.</string>
  <string id="6086259">I'm just me. You have to believe me!</string>
  <string id="6086261">If you were possessed, they would have sent you back to the Order. You're free to go, Keran.</string>
  <string id="6086262">I do believe you.</string>
  <string id="6086265">No, no. I'm me, I swear.</string>
  <string id="6086268">Go ahead and leave, Keran. You've been through enough.</string>
  <string id="6086269">You can leave.</string>
  <string id="6086270">Don't tell the templars. I-I don't know what they'd do to me.</string>
  <string id="6086273">Please. I need to go back, tell them I'm all right. Tell my sister... I-I must go.</string>
  <string id="6086280">When you talk to Ser Cullen, maybe downplay the blood magic angle. We don't need the templars cracking down even harder.</string>
  <string id="6086281">Cullen needs to hear about this mess.</string>
  <string id="6086282">Be careful when you tell Ser Cullen about this. If it's not handled correctly, innocent mages may suffer for Tarohne's crimes.</string>
  <string id="6086283">We should tell Ser Cullen about this. Maybe earn a templar's favor for a change.</string>
  <string id="6086284">Ser Cullen awaits our word.</string>
  <string id="6086285">I guess it's back to the wretched Gallows. Personally, I could do without blood mages or templars.</string>
  <string id="6086286">I suppose you must report to Ser Cullen.</string>
  <string id="6086287">We have quite the tale to tell Ser Cullen. I wonder if he'll believe us. I wonder if I believe us.</string>
  <string id="6086341">There's fault on both sides. We must find a way to live in peace.</string>
  <string id="6086342">There has to be a better way.</string>
  <string id="6086354">The situation is dealt with. Who is right and wrong is academic.</string>
  <string id="6086355">Whatever. It's done now.</string>
  <string id="6086359">If there is any chance he still harbors a demon in him—</string>
  <string id="6086360">We conducted tests on Keran. He's not possessed. He can stay in the Order.</string>
  <string id="6086361">Keran's fine.</string>
  <string id="6086362">I hesitate to ask what methods you used that you are so certain.</string>
  <string id="6086365">Keran did nothing wrong. You can't strip his livelihood on the off-chance Tarohne succeeded.</string>
  <string id="6086366">Keran should keep his status.</string>
  <string id="6086370">If a demon infiltrated the Templar Order, it would be disastrous.</string>
  <string id="6086371">You can't take any chances.</string>
  <string id="6086386">For your actions, take this. It's the reward I promised and more.</string>
  <string id="6086389">You have done the Order a great service. We will not forget it.</string>
  <string id="6086395">Word of the slaughter spread quickly.</string>
  <string id="6086448">Tell you what. I'll be here if you need me.</string>

  <string id="6086639">I'm impressed with your skill. Less so with your tact. But better you than the Winters, I suppose.</string>
  <string id="6086666">I've some bear traps here. Where do you want them?</string>
  <string id="6086667">Where do you want these bear traps?</string>
  <string id="6086668">The last of the bear traps. Let's make them count.</string>
  <string id="6086689">Look out. They're here!</string>
  <string id="6086695">Oh Andraste, I've never seen so many corpses. So much blood!</string>
  <string id="6086704">Here's a fire trap. Tell me where it should go.</string>
  <string id="6086706">I've another fire trap here. Quickly now!</string>
  <string id="6086707">Where does this fire trap go?</string>
  <string id="6086708">Last fire trap. Where does it go?</string>
  <string id="6086730">Looks like Nuncio made a few tries before he came to us.</string>
  <string id="6086731">Looks like we weren't the first people Nuncio hired for this job.</string>
  <string id="6086732">It seems Nuncio knew where his prey was hiding all along.</string>
  <string id="6086733">I'll wager this is the last crew Nuncio hired to draw the assassin out.</string>
  <string id="6086734">I don't think we're the first people Nuncio sent this way.</string>
  <string id="6086737">You're on your own, pal.</string>
  <string id="6086763">I'm sure you wish to loot the camp, yes? Talk to me when you are done.</string>
  <string id="6086770">You think Nuncio hired these poor sods as well?</string>
  <string id="6086789">Seneschal Bran will see to you.</string>
  <string id="6086796">This... this is a piece of the idol.</string>
  <string id="6086799">I should have known Bartrand would lie to me. Of course he'd keep a piece of the statue for himself.</string>
  <string id="6086804">So that's it. That's the whole story.</string>
  <string id="6086807">I see.</string>
  <string id="6086843">In that case, I wish I could help you.</string>
  <string id="6086849">Then you are free to go, Varric. May the Maker watch over you during the dark times ahead of us.</string>
  <string id="6086852">Same to you, Seeker. Same to you.</string>
  <string id="6086853">Go back.</string>
  <string id="6086854">Go back</string>
  <string id="6086868">So did you...?</string>
  <string id="6086871">Gone. Just like the Warden.</string>
  <string id="6086874">That is no coincidence.</string>
  <string id="6086877">It is in the Maker's hands now. We put our faith in Him.</string>
  <string id="6086883">Think of what we could do with this.</string>
  <string id="6086884">We came here to stop whatever was causing this trouble. That's the cause. Destroy it.</string>
  <string id="6086885">That wasn't the plan.</string>
  <string id="6086886">Varric, you've been acting strangely since we arrived. I don't think you want to keep that shard.</string>
  <string id="6086887">It's too dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6086888">I don't know about you, Varric, but I don't want to end up like Bartrand.</string>
  <string id="6086889">Like go insane?</string>
  <string id="6086893">That was a bit odd, wasn't it? If he came to the Dalish to hide, why do they give him away so easily?</string>
  <string id="6086894">Strange. The man wants to be found?</string>
  <string id="6086895">This assassin is strange indeed. Why do you think he would give away his position?</string>
  <string id="6086896">Dumb thing to do, letting the Dalish tell us where he is.</string>
  <string id="6086897">It's not like the People to just tell us where he is.</string>
  <string id="6086898">It's strange. Why would the assassin want the Dalish to give away his location?</string>
  <string id="6086905">Thank the Maker you're here!</string>
  <string id="6086906">Can you stop them?</string>
  <string id="6086907">You can help us, Champion, can't you?</string>
  <string id="6086908">I can't believe this is happening!</string>
  <string id="6086909">What are we going to do?</string>
  <string id="6086910">They're going to kill us, aren't they?</string>
  <string id="6086911">Why did this have to happen?</string>
  <string id="6086912">Maker have mercy on us.</string>
  <string id="6086920">Please help us, Champion!</string>
  <string id="6086921">Can you do anything?</string>
  <string id="6086922">If anyone can help us, you can.</string>
  <string id="6086923">We don't deserve this!</string>
  <string id="6086924">Cries</string>
  <string id="6086925">Though all before me is darkness, yet shall the Maker's Light be my guide.</string>
  <string id="6086926">For there is no darkness, nor death either, in the Maker's Light. </string>
  <string id="6086927">Blessed are they who stand before the corrupt and the wicked and do not falter.</string>
  <string id="6086930">I know that was the plan, Hawke, but plans change! I could put this shard to good use!</string>
  <string id="6086931">Suddenly you know what I want better than I do? Well, I'm sorry to tell you this, Hawke, but you're wrong. Again. </string>
  <string id="6086932">I'm not my brother, Hawke! The idol drove him crazy, but this is just one tiny piece!</string>
  <string id="6086940">I know you're just trying to look out for me, Hawke, but I can handle this! It's not the whole idol, it's just a sliver!</string>
  <string id="6086944">We're all going to die. At least I got to have some fun with Nella.</string>
  <string id="6086948">I shouldn't have come back here. This is all your fault.</string>
  <string id="6086949">Meredith is a handsome woman. If only she wasn't insane and trying to kill me.</string>
  <string id="6086958">I need this thing! Six years of my life have gone into this!</string>
  <string id="6086965">Three cheers for the Champion!</string>
  <string id="6086966">Thank the Maker you're on our side.</string>
  <string id="6086967">We'll crush those freaks once and for all!</string>
  <string id="6086968">I can't believe the grand cleric is dead.</string>
  <string id="6086969">They did this. They blew up the chantry!</string>
  <string id="6086970">We'll get them, won't we?</string>
  <string id="6086971">What are we going to find in there?</string>
  <string id="6086972">This is where the training kicks in, right?</string>
  <string id="6086973">Maker, preserve your faithful sons and daughters.</string>
  <string id="6086980">Good thing you're here!</string>
  <string id="6086981">Are we really storming the Gallows?</string>
  <string id="6086982">You'll be fighting with us, right?</string>
  <string id="6086983">They killed the grand cleric.</string>
  <string id="6086984">I don't understand why we're doing this.</string>
  <string id="6086985">I have a cousin who's a mage.</string>
  <string id="6086986">With you here, I know we're going to win.</string>
  <string id="6086987">Are there going to be demons in there?</string>
  <string id="6086988">Maker watch over you, Champion.</string>

  <string id="6087000">My only hope of finding out what happened to my brother is with this shard!</string>
  <string id="6087007">Three cheers for the Champion!</string>
  <string id="6087008">Thank the Maker you're on our side!</string>
  <string id="6087009">We'll crush those freaks once and for all!</string>
  <string id="6087010">I can't believe the grand cleric is dead...</string>
  <string id="6087011">They did this. They blew up the chantry!</string>
  <string id="6087012">We'll get them, won't we?</string>
  <string id="6087013">What are we going to find in there?</string>
  <string id="6087014">This is what we've trained for.</string>
  <string id="6087015">Maker preserve your faithful sons and daughters.</string>
  <string id="6087016">Please don't let me die a virgin, Champion. Please.</string>
  <string id="6087017">I haven't even said goodbye to my mother.</string>
  <string id="6087018">I'm not sure how I'm going to help. I'm not a very good mage.</string>
  <string id="6087025">We're going to stop them!</string>
  <string id="6087026">The knight-commander is insane, isn't she?</string>
  <string id="6087027">I want to kill that templar bitch!</string>
  <string id="6087028">I'm glad you're fighting with us, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6087029">We're not going down without a fight!</string>
  <string id="6087030">I'll take as many templars down with me as I can.</string>
  <string id="6087031">We'll get them, Champion, won't we?</string>
  <string id="6087032">I'll stop them. I'll do whatever it takes!</string>
  <string id="6087033">Put it to good use.</string>
  <string id="6087034">Keep it.</string>
  <string id="6087035">Everything that idol touches gets ruined. It has to be destroyed.</string>
  <string id="6087036">Get rid of it.</string>
  <string id="6087037">I just wanted to know how your clan was doing.</string>
  <string id="6087038">How are the Dalish faring?</string>
  <string id="6087039">We are doing quite well, considering.</string>
  <string id="6087042">It is our hope that one of our sister clans will give us some of their halla by year's end.</string>
  <string id="6087045">I see. Good day to you then.</string>
  <string id="6087051">Very well, just be careful with it.</string>
  <string id="6087052">Keep it.</string>
  <string id="6087053">I can't believe I'm saying this: If it means that much to you, keep the shard of craziness.</string>
  <string id="6087054">Keep it.</string>
  <string id="6087055">Thanks, Hawke. It's nice to be in agreement for once.</string>
  <string id="6087056">Listen to yourself, Varric! It's already controlling you! You have to let it go!</string>
  <string id="6087057">Get rid of it.</string>
  <string id="6087058">Varric, if you keep that thing, you'll go mad, I'll have to kill you, and Bianca will be heartbroken!</string>
  <string id="6087059">Get rid of it.</string>
  <string id="6087060">What are you afraid of, Hawke? That I might wind up with more power than you? That would just kill you, wouldn't it?</string>
  <string id="6087071">You're not listening, Hawke! I know I can handle this shard!</string>
  <string id="6087077">Prepare the area for battle and then talk to Saemus.</string>
  <string id="6087078">Defend Saemus from the Winters.</string>
  <string id="6087080">I knew you'd understand, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6087081">You're not strong enough to keep that thing. It'll corrupt you like it did Bartrand.</string>
  <string id="6087082">You're too weak.</string>
  <string id="6087083">It's not about you or me—nothing but madness and death has come from this damned thing.</string>
  <string id="6087084">The idol is corrupt.</string>
  <string id="6087085">Let me say it again slower: If you keep the shard, you will go crazy, and I will kill you.</string>
  <string id="6087086">No, but I might kill you.</string>
  <string id="6087087">That thing is cursed! It ruined your brother, and it'll ruin you, too! Get rid of it!</string>
  <string id="6087088">Nobody can handle it.</string>
  <string id="6087089">I'm worried, Varric. You're beginning to sound exactly like Bartrand.</string>
  <string id="6087090">This isn't like you.</string>
  <string id="6087091">Acting crazy is not a compelling argument in favor of keeping that accursed thing.</string>
  <string id="6087092">You're not convincing me.</string>
  <string id="6087096">I'm glad you're on our side, Champion. Now, we might actually have a chance.</string>
  <string id="6087097">I donated my stock to the Circle. They need it more than I do.</string>
  <string id="6087098">The templars can't win. It would be an injustice.</string>
  <string id="6087099">I hope I can be of some help.</string>
  <string id="6087103">Winding Alley</string>
  <string id="6087108">Thug</string>
  <string id="6087115">You do not belong here, shemlen.</string>
  <string id="6087116">What about my— Dear Maker! Where did my self-righteousness and pointy ears go?</string>
  <string id="6087117">You mean I'm not Dalish?</string>
  <string id="6087118">I don't wish to offend. I'll conduct my business and go.</string>
  <string id="6087119">My apologies.</string>
  <string id="6087120">I'm here for a reason. If you don't like it, pull out a blade or shut it.</string>
  <string id="6087121">I don't care.</string>
  <string id="6087122">I was told of an assassin hiding among the Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6087123">I'm looking for a fugitive.</string>
  <string id="6087124">Maybe you're right. I don't know. I'd rather not have you kill me over it, I guess. </string>
  <string id="6087125">Fine. I don't really want to argue about this anyway.</string>
  <string id="6087128">So many people have died, and more will die before this is over.</string>
  <string id="6087129">The Circle will never be the same. Not here, not anywhere.</string>
  <string id="6087130">I wonder what Grace would say if she saw this.</string>
  <string id="6087131">Talk to Variel. She's the one who likes to collect strays.</string>
  <string id="6087132">Why, you... You... Shemlen!</string>
  <string id="6087133">Meredith will get what's coming to her. She's gone too far.</string>
  <string id="6087137">Qunari Compound</string>
  <string id="6087139">So it's come to this. I suppose it was inevitable.</string>
  <string id="6087140">I should be afraid of what's to come, but I'm not.</string>
  <string id="6087144">You do that.</string>
  <string id="6087147">I... never mind.</string>
  <string id="6087152">Random encounter before talking to the Arishok.</string>
  <string id="6087153">Random encounter</string>
  <string id="6087158">It is apparently not enough that the Qunari define my political life. They must also infect what I hold personal.</string>
  <string id="6087161">It is my son, Saemus.</string>
  <string id="6087164">The life you saved, he would now squander by converting to the Qun. He has left for the Qunari Compound.</string>
  <string id="6087167">Not content in merely defending them, he has left for their compound to convert to the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6087170">Please, Serah Hawke. Convince Saemus to come home.</string>
  <string id="6087171">The Arishok says nothing good about Kirkwall, yet he accepts conversions?</string>
  <string id="6087172">They accept humans?</string>
  <string id="6087173">I cannot understand him—Maker knows I've tried—but he landed with, what, a few hundred men?</string>
  <string id="6087176">Add up the deaths and defections, and the Arishok must need to bolster his ranks.</string>
  <string id="6087179">I'm sure my son is quite the symbolic prize.</string>
  <string id="6087180">He is of age. The decision seems rightly his.</string>
  <string id="6087181">It's not his choice?</string>
  <string id="6087182">I want to let him find his way, but in my position...</string>
  <string id="6087185">He's taken a great deal of inspiration from you. I want to allow his idealism, but not blindly.</string>
  <string id="6087188">He is jaded, and that has caused him to lash out. If this is his choice, I must know that it was well considered.</string>
  <string id="6087191">At best, my opponents will claim that my office is now in Qunari hands.</string>
  <string id="6087194">At worst... I lose my son.</string>
  <string id="6087195">Did anyone else see him leaving for the compound?</string>
  <string id="6087196">Does anyone else know?</string>
  <string id="6087197">He made no secret of it. I'm sure he intended it as another of his statements about closer relations.</string>
  <string id="6087200">Your example inspired him. I might agree, but now is not the time. These matters are... delicate.</string>
  <string id="6087203">The violence he saw in youth poisoned his connection to his own people. Saemus's views have proven... unpopular for me. </string>
  <string id="6087206">He's politically dangerous, you mean.</string>
  <string id="6087209">The office must remain strong, Serah Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6087210">Sounds like your boy has issues with loyalty.</string>
  <string id="6087211">He's sided with them before?</string>
  <string id="6087212">My son knows that treating the Qunari like monsters does not help Kirkwall. He has the greater good at heart.</string>
  <string id="6087215">Unfortunately, he also has the impatience of youth. The process has to be respected, even if it's a damned mess.</string>
  <string id="6087216">Right, time to get a little scruff of the neck with the boy.</string>
  <string id="6087217">I'll bring him back.</string>
  <string id="6087218">I'm sure he will see reason.</string>
  <string id="6087219">I'll bring him home.</string>
  <string id="6087220">He's your child. How fast can he be?</string>
  <string id="6087221">I'll chase him down.</string>
  <string id="6087222">Who knows, he might actually listen to you. No one else has dealt as closely with the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6087225">I hope he will see that we can be accepting and still be a proud citizen of Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6087228">I wish we could all see that.</string>
  <string id="6087231">Dragging your boy out of the compound won't help matters.</string>
  <string id="6087232">And if he won't come?</string>
  <string id="6087233">I cannot leave him there. I hope... you can convince the Arishok that this will only inflame the situation.</string>
  <string id="6087236">He hasn't been quick to see reason to this point.</string>
  <string id="6087239">It is a hope. I am still allowed that, at least.</string>
  <string id="6087242">You know this will only end in trouble.</string>
  <string id="6087243">This will get ugly.</string>
  <string id="6087244">Fitting. That's where it started.</string>
  <string id="6087247">My son is not foolish. He will listen to reason. And you are in the best position to offer that opportunity.</string>
  <string id="6087250">Please, do what you can.</string>
  <string id="6087257">Bring my son home, Serah Hawke. This could all go very wrong.</string>
  <string id="6087264">Take it. It's your problem now. Maybe Enchantment! boy can dispose of the thing for you.</string>
  <string id="6087267">Let's go. I... think I could use some air.</string>
  <string id="6087270">Emrys</string>
  <string id="6087275">It figures. You come up short in so many ways.</string>
  <string id="6087277">I hope to use my abilities for a good cause.</string>
  <string id="6087278">Orsino seems so very tired, doesn't he?</string>
  <string id="6087279">Do you think I'll have to resort to blood magic in the battle? I hope not.</string>
  <string id="6087280">I hope this is all over soon.</string>
  <string id="6087281">I'll prove that you did the right thing by letting me go.</string>
  <string id="6087282">Dalish Camp Entrance</string>
  <string id="6087283">I wish Elthina didn't have to die. She seemed nice.</string>
  <string id="6087284">Yevhen</string>
  <string id="6087289">I sympathize with the mages, I really do, but killing the grand cleric? Sighs</string>
  <string id="6087295">She's hiding something, Hawke!</string>
  <string id="6087298">Merin</string>
  <string id="6087300">Iwan</string>
  <string id="6087302">Dera</string>
  <string id="6087311">Whatever you do, just do it.</string>
  <string id="6087312">I knew I could count on you.</string>
  <string id="6087315">I knew you would see reason.</string>
  <string id="6087319">This conflict is tearing our city apart. It will take years for the scars to heal.</string>
  <string id="6087320">I should've stayed in bed today.</string>
  <string id="6087321">The citizens of Kirkwall are locked in their homes. I hope this ends soon.</string>
  <string id="6087322">Meredith was never like this before. I wonder what changed.</string>
  <string id="6087323">The city guard will follow your lead, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6087326">What idol?</string>
  <string id="6087329">Don't lie to me! I know it's here! You must have found it.</string>
  <string id="6087339">Another one? Too many of you shemlen around lately.</string>
  <string id="6087343">To hear that from the Dalish surprises me, what with our history of love and tolerance.</string>
  <string id="6087344">That hurts.</string>
  <string id="6087345">Have a bit more respect, old elf.</string>
  <string id="6087346">You're pushing it.</string>
  <string id="6087347">What other shemlen have been here?</string>
  <string id="6087348">There have been others?</string>
  <string id="6087351">I swear, I don't know anything about an idol! Please!</string>
  <string id="6087367">I leave this to you, Hawke. Help my son.</string>
  <string id="6087368">Your Excellency.</string>
  <string id="6087371">Your tone does not fill me with hope, Serah Hawke. Where is my son?</string>
  <string id="6087372">A letter drew him away from the compound. A letter from you.</string>
  <string id="6087373">He was lured from the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6087374">I... sent no such letter. I would have no need, not with your assistance.</string>
  <string id="6087377">Saemus is missing and the Chantry is involved? What am I supposed to do now? I can't be seen to move against them.</string>
  <string id="6087378">You can't sit here while your son may be at risk.</string>
  <string id="6087379">Your son is in danger.</string>
  <string id="6087380">You do not understand the fury it would cause if I sent armed guards to a house of worship.</string>
  <string id="6087383">As much as the Chantry influences this office, I cannot be seen to do the reverse. Even... even at this cost.</string>
  <string id="6087386">Please, Hawke. Find him. You're the only option I have.</string>
  <string id="6087387">Stay here. I have the matter in hand.</string>
  <string id="6087388">I will handle it.</string>
  <string id="6087389">I would have no one else touch this. Thank you, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6087390">I will let you know when I have something.</string>
  <string id="6087391">I'm still looking into it.</string>
  <string id="6087392">Thank you. I know it is in capable hands.</string>
  <string id="6087393">Serah Hawk? Have you news of my son?</string>
  <string id="6087394">Fool's Gold</string>
  <string id="6087422">My son.</string>
  <string id="6087426">I hope Meredith knows what she's doing.</string>
  <string id="6087427">I will do what she commands of me, but... something about this isn't right.</string>
  <string id="6087428">You must steel yourself for what is to come. We both must.</string>
  <string id="6087429">The Right of Annulment was invoked on the Circle in Ferelden when I was younger.</string>
  <string id="6087432">There, it was justified—demons overran the whole tower. Here... it's much harder to tell who's in the wrong.</string>
  <string id="6087433">I am not looking forward to this.</string>
  <string id="6087451">You're doing that nervous, twitchy thing again, Hawke. Don't worry! I'll be careful with the shard.</string>
  <string id="6087459">Then all of you will die. The demand of the Qun is clear.</string>
  <string id="6087462">Maybe with you on our side, we can resolve this quickly, and with little bloodshed.</string>
  <string id="6087463">Listen, Hawke. I don't know what came over me back there in Bartrand's house.</string>
  <string id="6087466">Maybe you didn't mean to, but you did me a favor, talking me out of that.</string>
  <string id="6087467">I'm glad you're watching my back.</string>
  <string id="6087471">I was hoping I wouldn't have to beat sense into you.</string>
  <string id="6087472">Glad you agree.</string>
  <string id="6087473">I have a responsibility to the city to keep things like that shard away from innocent people.</string>
  <string id="6087474">I did what I had to.</string>
  <string id="6087475">I did do you a favor, didn't I? I'm pretty sure that means you're buying me a pint.</string>
  <string id="6087476">You owe me a drink.</string>
  <string id="6087477">Don't mention it.</string>
  <string id="6087478">Any time.</string>
  <string id="6087479">You had me worried there.</string>
  <string id="6087480">Glad you're all right.</string>
  <string id="6087481">That's what I'm here for. That, and doing all the fighting.</string>
  <string id="6087482">It's what I do.</string>
  <string id="6087485">Qunari</string>
  <string id="6087487">Indeed, my young shem. Indeed.</string>
  <string id="6087490">I've heard the Dalish are hiding an assassin in their camp. Do you know anything about this?</string>
  <string id="6087491">I'm looking for an Antivan.</string>
  <string id="6087492">It's been a long time since I've seen new elven faces around here. Maybe talk to Variel. She would know.</string>
  <string id="6087498">The Circle of Kirkwall is corrupt, and Orsino is ineffectual. Meredith should have invoked the Right years ago.</string>
  <string id="6087499">Too many have died at the hands of mages: Emeric, the grand cleric. Even your mother. It's time to end this.</string>
  <string id="6087500">Be strong, Champion. We're all counting on you.</string>
  <string id="6087501">May the Maker have mercy on Elthina. We do this in her name.</string>
  <string id="6087502">It's up to us to save Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6087503">Respect is given to those who deserve it, young shem.</string>
  <string id="6087506">Traders, mercenaries. Chantry types trying to convert us with their fine talk and veiled threats.</string>
  <string id="6087509">We've had enough of all that, thank you very much.</string>
  <string id="6087513">Your death, your rules.</string>
  <string id="6087514">I will fight you.</string>
  <string id="6087515">All right. Let's dance.</string>
  <string id="6087516">I will fight you.</string>
  <string id="6087517">Your elite versus mine. No others may interfere.</string>
  <string id="6087520">Let's do this.</string>
  <string id="6087521">I agree.</string>
  <string id="6087522">All right, let's put on a show.</string>
  <string id="6087523">I agree.</string>
  <string id="6087530">When that Meredith puts her mind to something... oh boy. Better get out of the way.</string>
  <string id="6087531">The knight-commander's a bitch, but I think she's got the right of it for once.</string>
  <string id="6087532">The mages are out of control, have been for too long.</string>
  <string id="6087533">The mages don't stand a chance.</string>
  <string id="6087534">I'll be ready to go when I get my lyrium. Just to wake me up—you know.</string>
  <string id="6087539">The grand cleric cannot help you!</string>
  <string id="6087545">Explain yourself, mage.</string>
  <string id="6087548">I will not stand by and watch you treat all mages like criminals...</string>
  <string id="6087551">...while those who would lead us bow to their templar jailers.</string>
  <string id="6087554">How dare you speak to—</string>
  <string id="6087557">The Circle has failed us, Orsino! Even you should be able to see that!</string>
  <string id="6087560">The time has come to act. There can be no half-measures.</string>
  <string id="6087563">Anders, what have you done?</string>
  <string id="6087566">There can be no turning back.</string>
  <string id="6087572">Maker have mercy!</string>
  <string id="6087575">There can be no peace.</string>
  <string id="6087581">Orsino is right. People will hear about this, and things will change.</string>
  <string id="6087585">Are you kidding? Of course I'll mention it! The guys at the Hanged Man are going to shit themselves over this story.</string>
  <string id="6087586">You never have to worry about me, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6087587">You know what I like about you, Hawke? Your humility.</string>
  <string id="6087591">I removed the chance of compromise, because there is no compromise.</string>
  <string id="6087595">It's for the best. The bruises of enlightenment fade quickly, Hawke. </string>
  <string id="6087596">I know, I know. You're the Champion of Kirkwall. Righter of wrongs and all that.</string>
  <string id="6087597">I think I can agree to that, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6087600">You did me a real favor back there. And for once, I'm not going to forget it.</string>
  <string id="6087601">You, of all people, know I'm trustworthy.</string>
  <string id="6087624">It's the Champion!</string>
  <string id="6087625">Hurrah!</string>
  <string id="6087626">Thank the Maker you're with us!</string>
  <string id="6087627">The Champion will get those mages!</string>
  <string id="6087631">It's the Champion!</string>
  <string id="6087632">Kill them!</string>
  <string id="6087633">They're helping the Circle!</string>
  <string id="6087634">For the Order!</string>
  <string id="6087641">It's the Champion!</string>
  <string id="6087642">Hurrah!</string>
  <string id="6087643">Thank the Maker you're with us!</string>
  <string id="6087644">The Champion will get those mages!</string>
  <string id="6087648">It's the Champion!</string>
  <string id="6087649">Kill them!</string>
  <string id="6087650">They're helping the Circle!</string>
  <string id="6087651">For the Order!</string>
  <string id="6087658">It's the Champion!</string>
  <string id="6087659">The Champion will help us!</string>
  <string id="6087660">Thank the Maker!</string>
  <string id="6087661">The Champion's here!</string>
  <string id="6087665">It's the Champion!</string>
  <string id="6087666">Arrest them!</string>
  <string id="6087667">Oh no!</string>
  <string id="6087668">Kill them all!</string>
  <string id="6087669">So... care to explain your particular brand of crazy?</string>
  <string id="6087670">Hello, lunatic.</string>
  <string id="6087671">I have feelings for her.</string>
  <string id="6087672">I am.</string>
  <string id="6087679">Never. You're the only woman for me, Isabela.</string>
  <string id="6087680">Jealous?</string>
  <string id="6087690">It's the Champion!</string>
  <string id="6087691">Hurray!</string>
  <string id="6087692">Thank the Maker you're with us!</string>
  <string id="6087693">The Champion will help us!</string>
  <string id="6087697">It's the Champion!</string>
  <string id="6087698">Oh no!</string>
  <string id="6087699">We're doomed!</string>
  <string id="6087700">Someone help us!</string>
  <string id="6087707">It's the Champion!</string>
  <string id="6087708">Hurray!</string>
  <string id="6087709">Thank the Maker you're with us!</string>
  <string id="6087710">The Champion will help us!</string>
  <string id="6087714">It's the Champion!</string>
  <string id="6087715">Oh no!</string>
  <string id="6087716">We're doomed!</string>
  <string id="6087717">Someone help us!</string>
  <string id="6087725">You're here!</string>
  <string id="6087726">The Champion!</string>
  <string id="6087727">Now here's a sight for sore eyes.</string>
  <string id="6087728">We need to stop them, Champion!</string>
  <string id="6087732">It's the Champion!</string>
  <string id="6087733">Get the Champion!</string>
  <string id="6087734">Quick! Kill them!</string>
  <string id="6087735">You want our heads? You can't have them!</string>
  <string id="6087736">Anders!</string>
  <string id="6087746">I don't see how this is any of your business.</string>
  <string id="6087747">Stay out of this.</string>
  <string id="6087756">How about we skip this one? Send your man instead?</string>
  <string id="6087757">And we have to play hero.</string>
  <string id="6087760">Move, guard. I need to pass.</string>
  <string id="6087761">Is there something I can do?</string>
  <string id="6087762">Yes, stay out. Now if you'll excuse me.</string>
  <string id="6087763">Easy son, keep your post. This is my risk.</string>
  <string id="6087764">I'll handle it.</string>
  <string id="6087765">Well... hold your breath.</string>
  <string id="6087766">Good luck with that.</string>
  <string id="6087773">This is... worse than I thought it would be.</string>
  <string id="6087774">The templars have always wanted this. They hate and fear us.</string>
  <string id="6087775">We need to get to the Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6087779">We need to get to the Gallows as soon as possible.</string>
  <string id="6087780">Meredith said she'd be at the Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6087781">The first enchanter went to the Gallows. We must find him.</string>
  <string id="6087782">For good or ill, this will all come to a head at the Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6087786">I have to admit it's good fighting with you again.</string>
  <string id="6087787">It's a good thing I came. Look what's happening to this city.</string>
  <string id="6087791">It's strange fighting at your side again.</string>
  <string id="6087792">Been a long time, hasn't it? I kind of like it.</string>
  <string id="6087796">We must move quickly, or the battle will be fought without us.</string>
  <string id="6087797">Here I am fighting to free mages. It is a wonder.</string>
  <string id="6087798">These mages must be crushed, the sooner the better.</string>
  <string id="6087799">Let's keep moving. We must get to the Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6087803">I suppose there are worse things to get caught up in.</string>
  <string id="6087804">Do you think the mages will reward us? With magic jewelry, perhaps?</string>
  <string id="6087805">What kind of reward will the templars give us? Not a copy of the chant, I hope.</string>
  <string id="6087806">This is kind of fun, actually.</string>
  <string id="6087807">I would have left the city, but maybe that's just me.</string>
  <string id="6087811">We need to get to the Gallows quickly!</string>
  <string id="6087812">These poor people! What did they ever do to deserve this?</string>
  <string id="6087813">I cannot believe we are actually doing this.</string>
  <string id="6087814">The city is being torn apart around us. They'll never get this cleaned up.</string>
  <string id="6087818">I don't know about this, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6087819">Destroying the Circle. I'll put that on the list of things I wasn't expecting to do today.</string>
  <string id="6087820">Dying to defend the rights of mages. I'll put that on the list of things I wasn't expecting to do today.</string>
  <string id="6087821">I've never been one for political causes, you know?</string>
  <string id="6087822">Let's just be careful. I don't want to take a fireball up the arse.</string>
  <string id="6087823">Let's just be careful. Last thing I need is a templar sword up my arse.</string>
  <string id="6087848">Don't worry. Helping people and killing people are what I'm best at.</string>
  <string id="6087849">Cheer up.</string>
  <string id="6087850">Give me the details.</string>
  <string id="6087851">What about him?</string>
  <string id="6087854">People harboring escaped mages just disappear. Templars interrogate and threaten passers-by.</string>
  <string id="6087857">My friend has a cousin who's a mage, and she says he was made Tranquil against his will. You hear more with every passing day.</string>
  <string id="6087873">City Guardsman</string>
  <string id="6087875">Samson</string>
  <string id="6087880">Maker guide my blade!</string>
  <string id="6087881">Evil falls today!</string>
  <string id="6087882">You shall pay for your insolence!</string>
  <string id="6087883">I shall strike down corruption!</string>
  <string id="6087884">The holy shall prevail!</string>
  <string id="6087888">Assist me!</string>
  <string id="6087914">This won't stop me!</string>
  <string id="6087919">Curse you!</string>
  <string id="6087929">I must protect the people!</string>
  <string id="6087934">To oblivion with you, wretch!</string>
  <string id="6087935">Another falls!</string>
  <string id="6087940">Damn your protections!</string>
  <string id="6087944">You cannot hide!</string>
  <string id="6087959">The Maker will protect me!</string>
  <string id="6088013">Urchin</string>
  <string id="6088015">Quentin</string>
  <string id="6088017">All That Remains</string>
  <string id="6088018">There appears to be a small commotion at the Hawke estate. Find out what's causing it.</string>
  <string id="6088023">Help Gamlen search for Leandra. Lowtown after nightfall may be a good place to start.</string>
  <string id="6088024">Follow the trail of blood.</string>
  <string id="6088025">Search the Lowtown foundry for Leandra.</string>

  <string id="6088060">He'll be waiting for you at the cave. Good luck trying to reach him, however.</string>
  <string id="6088063">I hear he still wears the shackles from his life in bondage... under his clothes.</string>
  <string id="6088064">I don't know what they say.</string>
  <string id="6088065">What do they say?</string>
  <string id="6088066">Sighs I'm going to regret asking you to continue, aren't I?</string>
  <string id="6088067">What do they say?</string>
  <string id="6088068">He can't find a saw.</string>
  <string id="6088071">Laughs</string>
  <string id="6088072">Keep it to yourself, Isabela.</string>
  <string id="6088073">I don't want to know.</string>
  <string id="6088079">Finish the plot off.</string>
  <string id="6088080">End plot.</string>
  <string id="6088084">Did you side with the Qunari or Petrice?</string>
  <string id="6088085">You fought against Mother Petrice's mob.</string>
  <string id="6088086">The Qunari</string>
  <string id="6088087">You fought the remaining Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6088088">Petrice</string>
  <string id="6088097">You and Fenris, eh? That taut, controlled body, the brooding demeanor and intense gaze... </string>
  <string id="6088102">I had you there! You thought I was going to say something dirty!</string>
  <string id="6088105">Laughs</string>
  <string id="6088108">My faith sustains me!</string>
  <string id="6088109">Blessed are the peacekeepers!</string>
  <string id="6088110">You will never prevail!</string>
  <string id="6088111">I cannot be stopped!</string>
  <string id="6088112">I'll find my own way out of here.</string>
  <string id="6088113">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="6088116">He said it'd be all right. Said we'd kill a few, not everyone. Not everyone!</string>
  <string id="6088119">Make the powder, blame the oxmen. Make the powder, blame the oxmen!</string>
  <string id="6088135">So in addition to sharing my food and my beds, now I've got to be your personal manservant?</string>
  <string id="6088138">The blighted post keeps dropping letters for you. Like you're the master of this house.</string>
  <string id="6088141">They're in that pile if you want to read them. Looked like some offers of work—might help you pay your way around here.</string>
  <string id="6088150">I don't remember Sabin. He must be from the outlying farms.</string>
  <string id="6088151">That's the problem with being a big fish in a small pond. I could never tell the little fish apart.</string>

  <string id="6088206">Templar</string>
  <string id="6088208">I'm guessing that templar wasn't here to offer your son his good wishes?</string>
  <string id="6088209">Your son's an apostate?</string>
  <string id="6088220">It might be, if you were going to give this up. But you're not.</string>
  <string id="6088221">Not if you keep this up.</string>
  <string id="6088222">That's not what I meant!</string>
  <string id="6088225">Wh-What happens now?</string>
  <string id="6088226">Back to the Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6088228">Oh, definitely. But lay off the murder, all right?</string>
  <string id="6088229">Sure, but don't go overboard.</string>
  <string id="6088233">Huh. Well I just lost a sovereign. Didn't think you'd stoop to our kind again.</string>
  <string id="6088234">Always.</string>
  <string id="6088237">Didn't go well?</string>
  <string id="6088241">A jigger of your finest whiskey for my friend over here!</string>
  <string id="6088244">The Hanged Man's finest isn't much, but it'll get you just as drunk as anything you'll find in Hightown.</string>
  <string id="6088245">That's generous of you.</string>
  <string id="6088246">Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6088247">What's coin for if not for spending, eh?</string>
  <string id="6088248">And you'll wake up and find someone's stolen your trousers.</string>
  <string id="6088249">That's not all.</string>
  <string id="6088250">I don't need a drink.</string>
  <string id="6088251">Save your money.</string>
  <string id="6088255">I thought I'd have to watch myself around you, but as it turns out, you're all right.</string>
  <string id="6088256">What do you mean I'm all right?</string>
  <string id="6088257">How so?</string>
  <string id="6088270">Watch out for the big guy!</string>
  <string id="6088271">Keep out of reach of that one!</string>
  <string id="6088275">They're sneaking around behind us!</string>
  <string id="6088276">Keep your guard up! These guys play dirty!</string>
  <string id="6088280">Duck!</string>
  <string id="6088281">This is one mother of a problem!</string>
  <string id="6088287">Or are you not too proud to make some coin?</string>
  <string id="6088288">No promises. But I'll hear what you have to say.</string>
  <string id="6088289">What's the job?</string>
  <string id="6088290">Pride usually hasn't been my downfall.</string>
  <string id="6088291">What's the job?</string>
  <string id="6088292">Just tell me what you want.</string>
  <string id="6088293">What's the job?</string>
  <string id="6088294">Since you stormed off, we don't have anyone who can quite work your magic, if you know what I mean.</string>
  <string id="6088297">I sent some men to fence a bit of cargo down at the docks. Haven't seen them since.</string>
  <string id="6088300">I'd pay good silver for the safe return of them or the goods.</string>
  <string id="6088301">Is this anyone I know?</string>
  <string id="6088302">Who's missing?</string>
  <string id="6088303">I just finished a year with my life in your hands. I'm not going back so quickly.</string>
  <string id="6088304">I'm not working with you.</string>
  <string id="6088305">Suit yourself. The pay is here when you're hungry enough.</string>
  <string id="6088308">Any chance you can tell if Keran has an extra passenger?</string>
  <string id="6088309">Is he possessed, Anders?</string>
  <string id="6088313">When you left, we had to take on new Fereldan... volunteers. Lad named Pryce was leading them.</string>
  <string id="6088316">No one of your caliber.</string>
  <string id="6088317">Want to tell me what you were selling?</string>
  <string id="6088318">What kind of goods?</string>
  <string id="6088319">We were trying to make a deal with the Carta—those Orzammar dwarves, they like luxury items.</string>
  <string id="6088322">Fine fabrics, a cask of caviar, an aged wine. Anything one can... liberate from a Hightown merchant.</string>
  <string id="6088323">Where were they last seen?</string>
  <string id="6088324">Where do I go?</string>
  <string id="6088325">They were supposed to meet down by the docks. Under cover of darkness.</string>
  <string id="6088328">I know you're familiar with the concept.</string>
  <string id="6088329">Consider it a deal.</string>
  <string id="6088330">I'll do it.</string>
  <string id="6088331">Good. Go to the Docks tonight. My boy Pryce was supposed to meet our buyers from the Carta there. Maybe you can find out what happened.</string>
  <string id="6088337">Hungry yet? Or are you still too proud to earn your coin with me?</string>

  <string id="6088352">What happened to You cast me about like a summer storm, and I loved every minute of it?</string>
  <string id="6088353">Just all right?</string>
  <string id="6088354">Chuckles You can enjoy a person in a bedroom, but detest their company outside of it.</string>
  <string id="6088370">That's Athenril's whelp—kill him!</string>
  <string id="6088395">Th-thank you. I thought them Coterie men had me for sure.</string>
  <string id="6088398">I guess the whole thing was a trap. There were no dwarves when I went to make the trade, just Coterie, waiting to kill us.</string>
  <string id="6088401">They got the rest of the boys. I ran. I was hoping they wouldn't find me here, but they did.</string>
  <string id="6088402">You're a bit young to be doing this.</string>
  <string id="6088403">And just how old are you?</string>
  <string id="6088404">I'm fifteen. But I can usually pass for a man.</string>
  <string id="6088407">So, will you be running home to tell Mama crime doesn't pay?</string>
  <string id="6088408">What will you do now?</string>
  <string id="6088409">My mama was ripped in two by one of them big horned darkspawn. It's just me and my sisters now.</string>
  <string id="6088412">If you didn't sell them, I need to return the goods to Athenril.</string>
  <string id="6088413">Give me the goods.</string>
  <string id="6088414">But... we was supposed to be paid out of the coin we'd bring. I can't come back with nothing.</string>
  <string id="6088417">Working for Athenril's the only way to feed the girls.</string>
  <string id="6088418">Why not take what Athenril gave you and start fresh somewhere outside of Kirkwall?</string>
  <string id="6088419">Keep the goods and start over.</string>
  <string id="6088420">I'm taking the goods anyway.</string>

  <string id="6088669">I felt the Veil shift. You called something here. Are you insane?</string>
  <string id="6088672">Y-yes, Master Hawke!</string>
  <string id="6088675">I am who I am, take it or leave it.</string>
  <string id="6088676">I don't need your approval.</string>
  <string id="6088677">Why have you taken the recruits?</string>
  <string id="6088678">What are you doing here?</string>
  <string id="6088679">Demons can inhabit much more than mages and corpses.</string>
  <string id="6088682">With assistance, they can control anyone I ask. Any templar... any noble... any well-meaning meddler.</string>
  <string id="6088684">If you turn yourself in now, the templars may spare your life.</string>
  <string id="6088685">Surrender peacefully.</string>
  <string id="6088686">The templars! We will destroy their entire pathetic order.</string>
  <string id="6088689">You do know I cut a path through your abominations, right?</string>
  <string id="6088690">I'm no easy prey.</string>
  <string id="6088691">Go ahead, try to give me to your demons.</string>
  <string id="6088692">Attack me. I dare you.</string>
  <string id="6088693">Good, good, the demons like spirit.</string>
  <string id="6088696">If a few more templars fall to the demons, we can seed chaos in their ranks.</string>
  <string id="6088702">How many abominations can they discover amongst their own before it drives the knight-commander crazy?</string>
  <string id="6088703">Tell me where Keran is.</string>
  <string id="6088704">Where are the recruits?</string>
  <string id="6088725">The experiments need so much fuel, you see. So many living vessels are found wanting.</string>
  <string id="6088728">Useless vessels can still feed the compost heap. So it's not a complete waste.</string>
  <string id="6088729">Good to know you're barking mad. That makes things easier.</string>
  <string id="6088730">Your plan is insane.</string>
  <string id="6088734">The demons are using you. Fight them.</string>
  <string id="6088735">Demons have corrupted you.</string>
  <string id="6088739">In days of old, the Tevinter Imperium spanned the known world. Demons were their allies—held in check by power and knowledge.</string>
  <string id="6088745">With a wave of a hand I could do more than a templar can achieve in a lifetime. Yet they command us? Absurd!</string>
  <string id="6088748">We should be ruling them. We should rule you all!</string>
  <string id="6088749">You're worse than a monster. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="6088750">You die now.</string>
  <string id="6088751">Kill the vessels only if you must.</string>
  <string id="6088759">I take it you know each other?</string>
  <string id="6088760">You know her, Aveline?</string>
  <string id="6088761">Harley is one of the guard, recently promoted.</string>
  <string id="6088764">You're a member of the guard, right?</string>
  <string id="6088765">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="6088766">I'm Lieutenant Harley. And this is what's left of my patrol.</string>
  <string id="6088769">This disaster is my first routine assignment.</string>
  <string id="6088770">Evets? Shit.</string>
  <string id="6088773">What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="6088776">There's a lot of farmland in the Free Marches. Surely there's somewhere you and your sisters can find honest work.</string>
  <string id="6088777">In Lothering, there were always families willing to take in a strong lad and a few girls to help with the cooking.</string>
  <string id="6088778">Most farmers will always take extra hands for the field or girls for the kitchen.</string>
  <string id="6088780">How would you like to be cooked, guard dog? Laughs</string>
  <string id="6088781">Attention. It's time to earn your pay, men.</string>
  <string id="6088782">All of you on me. Now!</string>
  <string id="6088783">Get as many of them as you can, and let's go.</string>
  <string id="6088784">Grab who you can, then.</string>
  <string id="6088791">There's always work to be found on farms for a healthy young man.</string>
  <string id="6088794">My father was a farmer. Before the darkspawn got him. I'd rather do that than... work for Athenril.</string>
  <string id="6088797">I-I'll get my sisters. Please, make sure she doesn't come after us.</string>
  <string id="6088800">Athenril told me this was my last chance or we were back on the streets.</string>
  <string id="6088803">I don't know what we're going to do now.</string>
  <string id="6088806">I don't know what we're going to do now.</string>
  <string id="6088828">Lowtown</string>
  <string id="6088829">Does arguing with Bartrand count?</string>
  <string id="6088830">I could tell you the standard tales: legions of darkspawn, ravenous beasts, cave-ins...</string>
  <string id="6088831">Sure, I could have a cup of tea in the morning, but I hear it's bad for you.</string>
  <string id="6088836">You could save up to buy yourself a new ship.</string>
  <string id="6088839">There you go, ruining our fun with good sense.</string>
  <string id="6088840">Oh. Well... more for me then!</string>
  <string id="6088845">I've spent my whole life in Kirkwall. Dangerous enough, most days, but it doesn't compare to the Deep Roads.</string>
  <string id="6088849">I heard blood mages took Keran. Blasted robes think they own the place.</string>
  <string id="6088852">So, this will be... let's just call it an adventure, I guess.</string>
  <string id="6088855">Great, now we're adventurers...</string>
  <string id="6088862">You're keeping your options open? That's unusually rational for you, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6088863">Somehow, I figure you won't be happy until you've got your butt in the viscount's throne.</string>
  <string id="6088864">It's true. I am the best thing in your sorry life.</string>
  <string id="6088866">Is that Athenril's rival criminal guild or something?</string>
  <string id="6088867">What's a Coterie?</string>
  <string id="6088868">More like she's their rival—a small one at that.</string>
  <string id="6088871">What I hear is the Coterie controls most crime in Kirkwall. And they don't like competition.</string>
  <string id="6088872">That's when you know it's a party!</string>
  <string id="6088878">Exit</string>
  <string id="6088889">The deal went sour. I brought back your goods.</string>
  <string id="6088892">These damfool Fereldans. Your family's the only one with enough brains to divide among them.</string>
  <string id="6088895">You've always been a professional, Hawke. Here's your cut.</string>
  <string id="6088898">Well? Are you here to socialize or did you bring my goods?</string>
  <string id="6088899">I rescued your boy and killed the Coterie, but your property was long gone.</string>
  <string id="6088900">The goods were stolen.</string>
  <string id="6088901">Coterie. I should have figured. They've got a lock on all trade with the dwarves.</string>
  <string id="6088904">If I'd had someone decent on the job, they'd have dug into it first, not walked in blindly.</string>
  <string id="6088907">Well, no cargo, no coin.</string>
  <string id="6088910">If you're ever looking for more work, I keep my books right here. Feel free to sign yourself up.</string>
  <string id="6088911">If you're ever looking for more work, let me know. Never know when I've got something.</string>
  <string id="6088914">I told that poor boy to keep the goods. What are you doing using a child like that?</string>
  <string id="6088915">I gave the goods away.</string>
  <string id="6088916">I made a charitable contribution to immigrant welfare.</string>
  <string id="6088917">I gave the goods away.</string>
  <string id="6088918">You used that child. I thought he deserved the profits.</string>
  <string id="6088919">I gave the goods away.</string>
  <string id="6088920">You what? You gave my goods away to that pock-marked brat?</string>
  <string id="6088923">You soft-hearted Fereldan bastard. I should have known better than to trust any of you.</string>
  <string id="6088926">Don't even think about working with me again.</string>
  <string id="6088931">That's mildly insulting, you know.</string>
  <string id="6088932">Just all right?</string>

  <string id="6088938">Lowtown</string>
  <string id="6088940">Hidden Trapdoor</string>

  <string id="6089093">Laughs Ah, no. No. As fun as that would be, I am... committed elsewhere.</string>
  <string id="6089096">Another time, perhaps. I am... still in mourning.</string>
  <string id="6089099">How do you do? My name is Zevran Arainai, adventurer and occasional assassin.</string>
  <string id="6089102">Slayer of Qunari, Deep Roads explorer, and may I say one fine specimen of manhood? You underestimate your fame!</string>
  <string id="6089103">You mentioned Crows.</string>
  <string id="6089104">You mentioned Crows.</string>
  <string id="6089105">We are the finest guild of assassins, an object of fear throughout the lands for any man with wealthy enemies!</string>
  <string id="6089108">There must be more to it than you leaving the guild.</string>
  <string id="6089109">Is that why they're after you?</string>
  <string id="6089110">That is offense enough to the Crows, believe me!</string>
  <string id="6089113">I may have also killed the last four assassins they sent after me. And all their men. Oh! And the Guildmaster.</string>
  <string id="6089116">In fact, if you were a Crow you might make a fortune bringing me in! You should consider a career change. Laughs No. Really.</string>
  <string id="6089117">You mentioned Crows.</string>
  <string id="6089118">Bring me to Nuncio if you wish, but I warn you: he surely intends to kill you. The Crows do not like loose ends, unlike myself.</string>
  <string id="6089121">But you are a man who can clearly handle himself, yes? Why worry?</string>
  <string id="6089124">But you are a woman who can clearly handle herself, yes? Why worry?</string>
  <string id="6089130">Oh! Another battle it is!</string>
  <string id="6089131">Time to dance!</string>
  <string id="6089132">Ooh! Now the fun part!</string>
  <string id="6089133">Ah, this gets the blood pumping!</string>
  <string id="6089134">Ha! Now we play a little!</string>
  <string id="6089138">Kill this one for me, will you?</string>
  <string id="6089139">Some help here, if you would!</string>
  <string id="6089143">Regroup!</string>
  <string id="6089144">To me!</string>
  <string id="6089148">Going to try something else!</string>
  <string id="6089149">Perhaps this!</string>
  <string id="6089153">That helps a bit!</string>
  <string id="6089154">This indeed helps!</string>
  <string id="6089163">I can't escape this!</string>
  <string id="6089164">Why can't I move?</string>
  <string id="6089168">I think I need to rest!</string>
  <string id="6089169">I cannot push it farther!</string>
  <string id="6089173">No more...</string>
  <string id="6089174">I can't keep this up!</string>
  <string id="6089178">Can't see much past all the blood...</string>
  <string id="6089179">I'm not going to last much longer!</string>
  <string id="6089180">A bit of help would be nice!</string>
  <string id="6089184">Ha! Another falls to Zevran!</string>
  <string id="6089185">I don't think that one will be getting back up!</string>
  <string id="6089189">This isn't working at all.</string>
  <string id="6089190">Brasca!</string>
  <string id="6089194">Really? You're trying to sneak up on me?</string>
  <string id="6089195">Ah! You there!</string>
  <string id="6089199">Perhaps we kill the one who can shoot lightning first?</string>
  <string id="6089200">Kill the mage!</string>
  <string id="6089204">We need to take out the archer!</string>
  <string id="6089205">Go for the archer!</string>
  <string id="6089209">I need to retreat!</string>
  <string id="6089210">I won't die here!</string>
  <string id="6089263">I don't detest your company outside of the bedroom.</string>
  <string id="6089267">Maker... learn to take a compliment, will you?</string>
  <string id="6089270">Darktown</string>
  <string id="6089271">Darktown</string>
  <string id="6089410">Keep that in mind, Hawke. Elves you see elsewhere? Figments of your imagination.</string>
  <string id="6089413">So you say. Frequently.</string>
  <string id="6089416">We remember who the People truly are, even as you city elves forget.</string>
  <string id="6089417">I'm pretty sure I've seen elves around who weren't Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6089420">They have given up their identity to live among shemlen. They are elvhen no more.</string>
  <string id="6089427">Good job, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6089428">You've always been a good one to have on the job.</string>
  <string id="6089429">I didn't think you'd be so eager to work with me again.</string>
  <string id="6089430">You really took care of that.</string>
  <string id="6089431">I never worry when you're on the job.</string>
  <string id="6089432">Trail of Blood</string>
  <string id="6089444">Taking you to the Templar recruits</string>
  <string id="6089445">Templar Hall</string>
  <string id="6089446">Taking you outisde Kirkwall to Wilmod and Cullen</string>
  <string id="6089447">Wilmod and Cullen</string>
  <string id="6089448">To the Brothel</string>
  <string id="6089449">To the Brothel</string>
  <string id="6089450">To the start of the bloodmage sanctuary</string>
  <string id="6089451">Blood mage Sanctuary</string>
  <string id="6089452">Go back</string>
  <string id="6089453">Go back</string>
  <string id="6089464">Well, if it ain't my favorite new citizen.</string>
  <string id="6089467">What are you doing here?</string>
  <string id="6089470">Did you finally figure out being free and poor in Kirkwall ain't worth a rat's spit? </string>
  <string id="6089471">You had an offer for me?</string>
  <string id="6089472">I got your letter.</string>
  <string id="6089473">My year's done. But a day's work for a day's pay, that I could do.</string>
  <string id="6089474">I'm here for work.</string>
  <string id="6089475">You mean you're not too good for my kind of work? Because the blokes I hired after you couldn't find their ass with both hands.</string>
  <string id="6089478">I sent them to take out Lord Harimann while he was preparing his cargo for shipping. Night-time, docks, simple.</string>
  <string id="6089481">Never came back.</string>
  <string id="6089482">I haven't heard a job in this yet.</string>
  <string id="6089483">What do you want me to do?</string>
  <string id="6089484">The job's the same—kill Harimann—but there'll be a bonus if you find my men alive.</string>
  <string id="6089485">Who's Lord Harimann?</string>
  <string id="6089486">Tell me about the target.</string>
  <string id="6089487">I don't know the who, but the what is old and rich.</string>
  <string id="6089490">Rumor says he's a savvy one. His daughters give him marriage ties to half the city.</string>
  <string id="6089491">I assume this isn't personal?</string>
  <string id="6089492">Who's hiring?</string>
  <string id="6089493">Job's paid for second-hand by some other old Kirkwall family.</string>
  <string id="6089496">The nobles here like to shank each other for sport. We're just their knives.</string>
  <string id="6089497">I'm sure I can finish what they started.</string>
  <string id="6089498">I can help you.</string>
  <string id="6089499">They were supposed to ambush him at the docks. That'd be the best place to start looking.</string>
  <string id="6089502">And remember, Harimann dead, my lad Gustav alive. Other way around, then you don't get paid.</string>
  <string id="6089505">Being a mercenary just wasn't for me.</string>
  <string id="6089506">I don't kill for coin.</string>
  <string id="6089507">My mistake. I forgot I never want to see you again.</string>
  <string id="6089508">I was just leaving.</string>
  <string id="6089509">You'll be back when you need coin bad enough.</string>
  <string id="6089516">You decide slitting throats is better than begging?</string>
  <string id="6089517">Wilmod's Camp</string>
  <string id="6089525">Did you hear something about that?</string>
  <string id="6089526">Is there?</string>
  <string id="6089527">Sighs I was joking. You still know what a joke is, right?</string>
  <string id="6089530">Can't you hear the screams? We need to go!</string>
  <string id="6089531">Of course!</string>
  <string id="6089532">Why don't you go save them? Bring Aveline or something. I'm busy relaxing.</string>
  <string id="6089535">Unlike some people, I know how to enjoy life.</string>
  <string id="6089538">That's not funny.</string>
  <string id="6089539">No.</string>
  <string id="6089540">That's a surprise. Sniggers Is there anything you do find funny?</string>
  <string id="6089561">Stay here. I'll do this alone.</string>
  <string id="6089562">Either you're with me on the assault, or you're a deserter. We all know what happens to deserters.</string>
  <string id="6089568">You'd make a fine captain of the guard.</string>
  <string id="6089571">Evets Marauders. They're just men. Flesh and bone.</string>
  <string id="6089572">I'll give them hope.</string>
  <string id="6089573">Flesh can be torn. Bones can be broken. Alone, they will pick you off one-by-one.</string>
  <string id="6089576">Together, we are unstoppable. On me!</string>
  <string id="6089577">Men, we're taking the battle to them.</string>
  <string id="6089586">I think you enjoy life a bit too much.</string>
  <string id="6089587">Life's not all fun and games.</string>
  <string id="6089588">And why not? Life's short.</string>
  <string id="6089601">Hurt him, but leave him alive. We'll find out who sent this little rat... one way or another.</string>
  <string id="6089613">H-Hawke? I-I've seen you with Meeran before. Did he send you to get me?</string>
  <string id="6089616">You tell Meeran I never turned on him.</string>
  <string id="6089619">You were very dedicated.</string>
  <string id="6089620">I'll tell him.</string>
  <string id="6089641">Here they come!</string>
  <string id="6089644">Just like always.</string>
  <string id="6089645">It has been an honor, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6089646">I hate it when you say that.</string>
  <string id="6089650">This is where the old ones used to sleep. It wasn't a sad place then.</string>
  <string id="6089660">What do you say we put an end to all this waiting around and go meet destiny?</string>
  <string id="6089665">More bear traps. Show me where to set them. Hurry!</string>
  <string id="6089666">What are you doing? They're almost on me.</string>
  <string id="6089667">More! More on the way!</string>
  <string id="6089668">Let me go! You'll pay for this!</string>
  <string id="6089669">Leave Area</string>
  <string id="6089674">Barrier</string>
  <string id="6089682">My mining operation could be in grave jeopardy, and no one can tell me what is going on!</string>
  <string id="6089685">I implore you, Champion! Go to the Bone Pit and set things straight!</string>
  <string id="6089686">I've heard the place is riddled with misfortune. Why would you have a mining operation there?</string>
  <string id="6089687">Isn't the Bone Pit cursed?</string>
  <string id="6089688">I thought the rumors were exaggerated. The mine has been good for the city these last few years.</string>
  <string id="6089691">It provides hundreds of jobs for your own countrymen, Fereldan expatriates who would otherwise be on the streets.</string>
  <string id="6089695">Altar</string>
  <string id="6089699">I've little reward to offer you, Champion, but perhaps this will serve as a token of my thanks.</string>
  <string id="6089702">Normally I would jump at the chance, but my dear Warden may be a tad put out.</string>
  <string id="6089705">The memories are a little too fresh, dear woman. Another time.</string>
  <string id="6089708">Fine. But there better be sex to make up for it later.</string>
  <string id="6089713">That's because you have piss-poor aim. Thankfully, you've other uses.</string>
  <string id="6089714">I hope we learned a lesson, yes? You cannot trust a Crow. Unless he is ridiculously handsome.</string>
  <string id="6089720">It is time for me to move on. I've a Warden to return to, after all... it's been far too long.</string>
  <string id="6089723">It is time for me to move on. Unless you'd... care to get to know each other better, Champion?</string>
  <string id="6089726">I think we've heard enough from you.</string>
  <string id="6089729">Is there more to know about you? Seems like it's all right there on the surface.</string>
  <string id="6089732">That depends. How much do you wish to test that luck of yours?</string>
  <string id="6089735">Oh, I see. Fair enough, then!</string>
  <string id="6089738">I warn you, I grew up among whores. My fingers are quite nimble.</string>
  <string id="6089739">I like nimble fingers.</string>
  <string id="6089740">Sounds good to me!</string>
  <string id="6089741">Excellent! A small diversion before I head home to wage my war against the guild.</string>
  <string id="6089744">Or perhaps I should say a large diversion. No need to undersell it.</string>
  <string id="6089750">Some other time, perhaps.</string>
  <string id="6089751">Maybe later.</string>
  <string id="6089752">Ah, that's too bad.</string>
  <string id="6089755">It is time to move on, as they say. I've a little war to wage back home, and so little time.</string>
  <string id="6089763">Are you sure you do not wish to tie me up? Not even a little?</string>
  <string id="6089764">Now you I wasn't expecting.</string>
  <string id="6089769">I'll follow you whenever you're ready to leave, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6089770">He can wait his turn. I won't lose any sleep over it.</string>
  <string id="6089771">Join the crowd.</string>
  <string id="6089781">We did it just like we trained. Followed at a distance, waited for nightfall...</string>
  <string id="6089784">I'm not going back until you can walk, limp, or crawl behind me.</string>
  <string id="6089785">You'll tell him yourself.</string>
  <string id="6089786">I-I think I can walk. You got here before Harimann's men could do much damage.</string>
  <string id="6089789">What about the target? Did you get him?</string>
  <string id="6089790">Is Harimann dead?</string>
  <string id="6089791">We tried. His men were too good.</string>
  <string id="6089794">His rear guard saw us coming. They fell on us from all sides.</string>
  <string id="6089797">Which any professional would have expected.</string>
  <string id="6089800">That's him. That's Lord Harimann.</string>
  <string id="6089803">Most of my enemies would not stoop this low. Are you working for Conrad Tulli? Perhaps Lady Reinhardt?</string>
  <string id="6089804">What have you done that so many people want you dead?</string>
  <string id="6089805">Why would they kill you?</string>
  <string id="6089806">You sound Fereldan.</string>
  <string id="6089809">So you should know I'm the one who convinced the viscount to send aid to Denerim.</string>
  <string id="6089812">Many of my fellow noblemen resent that. They want me dead before he sends the money, so they can reclaim it for Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6089813">This is not a job I can complete.</string>
  <string id="6089814">No.</string>
  <string id="6089815">Thank you, Fereldan.</string>
  <string id="6089818">When I learn who sent you, I will be sure to leave you out of any retribution.</string>
  <string id="6089821">Sorry. It's not personal.</string>
  <string id="6089822">You're a dead man.</string>
  <string id="6089823">I'm afraid you'll never know.</string>
  <string id="6089824">You're a dead man.</string>
  <string id="6089825">Whoever ordered it, it's their lucky day.</string>
  <string id="6089826">You're a dead man.</string>
  <string id="6089827">Let's finish this.</string>
  <string id="6089828">You're a dead man.</string>
  <string id="6089829">My sons will learn who sent you. My death will not go unavenged.</string>
  <string id="6089835">I'd have figured a soft noble like that would go down begging. That was damn gutsy.</string>
  <string id="6089841">I-I don't want to be the one to tell Meeran you did that.</string>
  <string id="6089848">Lord Harimann is dead.</string>
  <string id="6089851">Yes, yes. Gustav raved about your bravery already.</string>
  <string id="6089854">Here's the bounty. And a little extra for Gustav, for what that's worth.</string>
  <string id="6089857">If you need more work, I keep my list right here. You're welcome to take anything on it.</string>
  <string id="6089858">If you're up for more of this sort of work, let me know. I could make some arrangements.</string>
  <string id="6089861">So, Gustav limped back here, but refuses to speak one word of what happened.</string>
  <string id="6089864">Spit it out. Is Harimann dead or not?</string>
  <string id="6089865">He was gone by the time I got there. I just killed his guards.</string>
  <string id="6089866">I couldn't find him.</string>
  <string id="6089867">He's being hunted for aiding my people. I will not kill him.</string>
  <string id="6089868">Not.</string>
  <string id="6089869">Emma ir abelas souver'inan isala hamin vhenan him dor'felas.</string>
  <string id="6089878">Hrmph. I thought you were better at this. Guess nothing happens if I don't do it myself.</string>
  <string id="6089881">Forget the bounty, but here's a bit for bringing Gustav back.</string>
  <string id="6089884">I think you forgot the rules, dog-lord. Once you take the job, you do the job. You don't decide if it's right.</string>
  <string id="6089887">I'll take care of this myself.</string>
  <string id="6089890">Don't try hitting me up for coin again. That door is closed.</string>
  <string id="6089897">The Harimann family's been throwing a lot of coin around, trying to find out who came after their lord.</string>
  <string id="6089900">From the look of these traps, the assassin was definitely expecting company.</string>
  <string id="6089901">I hope there aren't a lot more of these traps left.</string>
  <string id="6089902">It's like he's ready for an army, with all these traps!</string>
  <string id="6089903">Not many could make it past all of these traps.</string>
  <string id="6089904">Be careful. Where one trap is set, there are usually more.</string>
  <string id="6089905">Traps. You can't say our man wasn't prepared.</string>
  <string id="6089914">With the Undercity sewers backed up, I'll take any excuse to get out of town.</string>
  <string id="6089915">I have nothing better to do.</string>
  <string id="6089916">Since I became Champion of Kirkwall, everyone wants a piece of me.</string>
  <string id="6089917">Do I know you?</string>
  <string id="6089918">The founder of their religion, the most revered being in their history? That text would be sacred beyond measure.</string>
  <string id="6089925">I think it's safe now. Place the amulet on the altar, and I'll begin the rite.</string>
  <string id="6089947">Since they have sacrificed the most, the workers will own and run the mine, under my supervision.</string>
  <string id="6089950">What? After all I have invested—</string>
  <string id="6089953">Hubert, you'll be a silent partner until your share's bought out.</string>
  <string id="6089956">Shit! Fine! I am sick of this pit anyway. I should have sold it years ago!</string>
  <string id="6089959">As the person with the most impressive title, I'll make the decisions here, thank you.</string>
  <string id="6089960">I'm taking over as mine boss.</string>
  <string id="6089961">I'm taking over the Bone Pit, effective now!</string>
  <string id="6089964">You will give the mine over to me. Unless you'd rather pay with your life.</string>
  <string id="6089965">I'm taking over as mine boss.</string>
  <string id="6089994">Maker watch over you.</string>
  <string id="6090027">Enchantments?</string>
  <string id="6090034">But he's been gone far too long. Something terrible has happened.</string>
  <string id="6090037">Who is the Architect?</string>
  <string id="6090038">The Architect?</string>
  <string id="6090039">The Architect was the first of the speaking and thinking darkspawn. Very dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6090042">He spread his gift to other darkspawn—the disciples. Fortunately, their numbers are few.</string>
  <string id="6090043">Blow the barrels! Now!</string>
  <string id="6090046">Look, the explosives that Temmerin mentioned.</string>
  <string id="6090055">If we're going to the Deep Roads, it may be good to bring Anders along. He has that whole Warden sense thing going for him.</string>
  <string id="6090056">Anders is a Warden. He may want to help with this.</string>
  <string id="6090057">If we're chasing Wardens, perhaps Anders should come along.</string>
  <string id="6090058">I apologize I couldn't answer all your questions. You may have them yet, in the fullness of time.</string>
  <string id="6090068">Then how much time before you...?</string>
  <string id="6090185">I'll tell Meeran to look out for his heirs.</string>
  <string id="6090190">Good job, Hawke. I knew I could count on you.</string>
  <string id="6090191">All this unrest in the city, business is good. Check my list if you want jobs.</string>
  <string id="6090192">I can always use someone like you.</string>
  <string id="6090193">Thanks for your help with that.</string>
  <string id="6090194">It's been a pleasure.</string>
  <string id="6090195">Glad you took care of that little mess for us.</string>
  <string id="6090203">Leave Area</string>
  <string id="6090207">But he's done only good for the Fereldans here.</string>
  <string id="6090210">Don't you threaten me! You think we're strangers to violence, after the Blight?</string>
  <string id="6090213">Any Fereldan in the city would lay down his life for the healer, after what he's done for us. Still...</string>
  <string id="6090216">The healer will decide for himself if you're worth his aid.</string>
  <string id="6090234">A dragon attacked your mine. Everyone is dead.</string>
  <string id="6090237">Dear Maker! What of my equipment? Did it seem salvageable?</string>
  <string id="6090238">The dragons scorched every last cart and shovel.</string>
  <string id="6090239">Everything was razed.</string>
  <string id="6090240">Unfortunately, your precious equipment didn't make it... and neither did your workers.</string>
  <string id="6090241">You selfish bastard.</string>
  <string id="6090247">I'd like a little one-on-one time. I'll be at the Hanged Man later.</string>
  <string id="6090250">I've got something to tell you. But it can wait till we're back in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6090251">Elven Graveyard</string>
  <string id="6090262">The mountain is home to a lot of terrible things. Remnants of a war, long ago. Be on your guard.</string>
  <string id="6090265">Oh, is that a trillium? I love trilliums! Beautiful flowers. They smell a bit like garbage, though. Very sad.</string>
  <string id="6090268">It's sort of a long walk to the graveyard. I hope you wore comfortable shoes.</string>
  <string id="6090271">I hope we're going the right way. I get turned around a lot up here.</string>
  <string id="6090282">Sabin's Stash</string>
  <string id="6090297">Right, there's the target! They don't reach the compound!</string>
  <string id="6090301">Hey! We heard you in there. Asking about the healer.</string>
  <string id="6090304">We know what happens to mages in this town.</string>
  <string id="6090307">And it ain't gonna happen to him.</string>
  <string id="6090314">I once knew a sailor like you. We lost him in a hurricane. Very sad.</string>
  <string id="6090317">If you keep prodding me like that, I'm going to start taking it the wrong way.</string>
  <string id="6090318">If you're not going to get drunk with me, I'm afraid I can't take you seriously.</string>
  <string id="6090319">What's that foul smell? Is that you? No, wait... that's just me.</string>
  <string id="6090320">You want to chat? Maybe come by the tavern later.</string>
  <string id="6090321">Hey, I'd like to discuss something with you. Meet me in the Hanged Man when you've a moment.</string>
  <string id="6090322">Now's not a good time. But we can talk once we get back to the city.</string>
  <string id="6090323">I'd like to speak with you, once we're back in the city.</string>
  <string id="6090326">So was that anti-Qunari, anti-viscount, or Saemus himself not wanting to be rescued?</string>
  <string id="6090329">So who hired that lot? Anti-Qunari, anti-viscount, or Saemus himself not wanting to be rescued?</string>
  <string id="6090332">Want to place bets on who sent them? Anti-Qunari group, anti-viscount, or Saemus himself?</string>
  <string id="6090335">So who hired that lot? Anti-Qunari, anti-viscount, or Saemus himself not wanting to be rescued?</string>
  <string id="6090338">So, why did they attack us? Were they against the Qunari? Or the viscount? Or... you don't think Saemus sent them, do you?</string>
  <string id="6090341">So, who hired that lot? Anti-Qunari, anti-viscount, or Saemus himself not wanting to be rescued?</string>
  <string id="6090344">It doesn't change the job. Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6090345">So, was that bunch anti-Qunari, anti-viscount, or from Saemus not wanting a rescue?</string>
  <string id="6090362">Oh, my heart! So many years of investment... I am ruined. Ruined!</string>
  <string id="6090365">I am sorry, Champion, I appreciate your help, but I sank all my coin into that rotten mine. I have nothing left to pay you.</string>
  <string id="6090366">Give me the Bone Pit. Perhaps in a few years I can get it back in order.</string>
  <string id="6090367">I'll take the mine.</string>
  <string id="6090368">What? Scoffs Fine, take it! I wash my hands of this cursed venture!</string>
  <string id="6090371">I slew the dragon to protect the city. I need no coin from you.</string>
  <string id="6090372">I didn't do this for money.</string>
  <string id="6090373">No. And neither did the workers who died trying to save it.</string>
  <string id="6090374">Priorities first, right?</string>

  <string id="6090391">Saemus isn't the type. Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6090392">I aim to disappoint any and all of them.</string>
  <string id="6090393">It's nice to be popular, isn't it? Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6090406">So, hope the Arishok wasn't planning on keeping the viscount's son.</string>
  <string id="6090407">Well, hope the Arishok hasn't grown attached to the viscount's boy.</string>
  <string id="6090408">Well, hope the viscount's boy hasn't settled in.</string>
  <string id="6090409">Well, hope the Arishok hasn't grown attached to the viscount's boy.</string>
  <string id="6090410">I hope the Arishok won't miss the viscount's boy too much.</string>
  <string id="6090411">Well, hope the Arishok hasn't grown attached to the viscount's boy.</string>

  <string id="6090431">I'm bored of this. We should do something fun.</string>
  <string id="6090432">Have you ever been out on the open ocean in a storm? It's the best feeling in the world.</string>
  <string id="6090433">Anything interesting happening around town?</string>
  <string id="6090434">I found this amazing hat shop in Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6090435">You're like an itch I can't scratch. Or something. I'm not good at metaphors.</string>

  <string id="6090443">This seems too quiet. Where is Saemus?</string>
  <string id="6090444">Seems too quiet. Where is Saemus?</string>
  <string id="6090445">Not trusting the look of this. Where's the viscount's boy?</string>
  <string id="6090446">It's too quiet. Where is Saemus?</string>
  <string id="6090447">I don't like this. Something's wrong here.</string>
  <string id="6090448">Too quiet. Where's the boy?</string>
  <string id="6090449">Too quiet. Where is the viscount's son?</string>
  <string id="6090452">This won't exactly ease tensions. The viscount's son and Qunari aggression, even if justified...</string>
  <string id="6090453">An end of sorts, but the Qunari in the chantry and the viscount's dead son won't simply fade from memory.</string>
  <string id="6090454">So, everything is great now. Qunari in the chantry and a dead son will just fade from memory.</string>
  <string id="6090455">People will not be quick to forget the viscount's son and that this happened in the chantry.</string>
  <string id="6090456">I get the feeling this did the opposite of helping. The viscount's son, Qunari in the chantry...</string>
  <string id="6090457">Well. I'm sure everyone will calm down now. No lasting damage... aside from all the damage.</string>
  <string id="6090461">Debug Torch Marker</string>
  <string id="6090569">A New Home?</string>
  <string id="6090599">Go to Gamlen's home in Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6090809">You need to relax once in a while. Take a deep breath. Learn to enjoy life. Like me!</string>
  <string id="6090810">Don't hold me to your standards.</string>
  <string id="6090811">I'm not you.</string>
  <string id="6090812">Standards? Chuckles You're the one with the exacting standards. The one who's always got to be doing something important.</string>
  <string id="6090813">My idea of fun doesn't involve bad whiskey in a flea-ridden rat hole.</string>
  <string id="6090814">I enjoy life just fine.</string>
  <string id="6090815">Grunts Snob. And you know that's not what I meant.</string>
  <string id="6090820">When you get right down to it, we're not responsible for anyone but ourselves.</string>
  <string id="6090829">Most dragons kill for food or territory. These bodies were not devoured, so they must see this place as their own.</string>
  <string id="6090832">They never stood a chance.</string>
  <string id="6090835">This was pure slaughter.</string>
  <string id="6090838">So many dead...</string>
  <string id="6090841">I wonder if anyone could have prevented this.</string>
  <string id="6090842">Don't you have anything better to do with your time?</string>
  <string id="6090845">Like what?</string>
  <string id="6090848">Have you ever thought of saving your coin to buy a ship instead of spending it on drinks and card games?</string>
  <string id="6090851">What? You expect me to think that far ahead? Please.</string>
  <string id="6090854">So... what's new? Why are you here?</string>
  <string id="6090857">Is there a burning orphanage full of children we need to save, or something?</string>
  <string id="6090863">You can choose to be free, or you can choose to be saddled with all the world's problems.</string>
  <string id="6090864">You're just irresponsible and selfish.</string>
  <string id="6090865">You're not free.</string>
  <string id="6090866">Eh. Why quibble over definitions?</string>
  <string id="6090869">We're done here. Talking to you is exhausting. And not much fun.</string>
  <string id="6090872">Life would be empty and cheerless if I couldn't share my good fortune and help the needy.</string>
  <string id="6090873">Helping others is rewarding.</string>
  <string id="6090874">That's the most pathetic thing I've heard all day.</string>
  <string id="6090877">Being involved in Kirkwall's problems has given me coin, power, and influence.</string>
  <string id="6090878">Helping others benefits me.</string>
  <string id="6090879">And people keep coming to you. They're taking advantage of you.</string>
  <string id="6090882">Fact is, you're nothing but a glorified errand girl.</string>
  <string id="6090885">Fact is, you're nothing but a glorified errand boy.</string>
  <string id="6090888">Corridors lined with explosives and darkspawn galore? It's not even my birthday!</string>
  <string id="6090889">Explosives? Sounds like fun.</string>
  <string id="6090893">You will feed my brood!</string>
  <string id="6090894">You will fall!</string>
  <string id="6090895">You cannot win!</string>
  <string id="6090899">Brood, attack!</string>
  <string id="6090903">On me, now!</string>
  <string id="6090907">Perhaps you will like the taste of this!</string>

  <string id="6090921">Must rest.</string>
  <string id="6090925">Must rest.</string>

  <string id="6090934">We will feed on your flesh!</string>
  <string id="6090935">The frail one falls!</string>
  <string id="6090939">This has... no effect!</string>
  <string id="6090943">You cannot hide from me!</string>
  <string id="6090947">Attack the magus—do not kill, though.</string>
  <string id="6090948">On the magus, now!</string>
  <string id="6090952">Devour the archer!</string>
  <string id="6090956">Must fall back.</string>
  <string id="6091012">Gather the vessels my children!</string>
  <string id="6091013">You cannot stand against us!</string>
  <string id="6091014">The demons will convert you. Yes!</string>
  <string id="6091018">Concentrate your magics, my children.</string>
  <string id="6091022">On me!</string>
  <string id="6091026">Perhaps another tactic.</string>
  <string id="6091035">Cannot move!</string>
  <string id="6091039">This is draining.</string>
  <string id="6091044">My magic is failing.</string>

  <string id="6091053">Another vessel is ready. Haha!</string>
  <string id="6091054">One of your friends has fallen. Ha!</string>
  <string id="6091058">This isn't working.</string>
  <string id="6091062">You cannot hide!</string>
  <string id="6091067">The vessel must go down!</string>
  <string id="6091071">Kill the archers!</string>
  <string id="6091075">This isn't going well.</string>
  <string id="6091131">Guard dogs, die!</string>

  <string id="6091141">Marauders, on me!</string>
  <string id="6091145">Gonna switch things up.</string>
  <string id="6091154">My feet. Damn it!</string>
  <string id="6091158">This is draining.</string>
  <string id="6091163">Almost out of magic.</string>
  <string id="6091167">You won't kill me!</string>
  <string id="6091168">I'm hurting. Help!</string>
  <string id="6091172">Ahh, poor guard dog is down.</string>
  <string id="6091173">Another one down.</string>
  <string id="6091177">Not working!</string>
  <string id="6091181">I see you!</string>
  <string id="6091186">The spellflinger's gotta die!</string>
  <string id="6091190">Make that archer dead!</string>
  <string id="6091194">Damn it, fall back.</string>
  <string id="6091369">The knight-commander and her templars scare me more and more.</string>
  <string id="6091373">The things my brother tells me about the Order... His letters disturb me.</string>
  <string id="6091374">I hope Keran will be safe.</string>
  <string id="6091378">Thank the Maker my brother is no longer in the Order.</string>
  <string id="6091379">Keran's so unhappy, but at least he's safe.</string>
  <string id="6091386">I thought it would be an honor to be a templar.</string>
  <string id="6091387">I will never forget what Tarohne did, but surely we bear some blame for creating her?</string>
  <string id="6091388">Templars are meant to serve the Maker and all His creations, not just the will of the knight-commander.</string>
  <string id="6091392">With so many refugees, there's no good jobs left.</string>
  <string id="6091393">I'm reduced to a common sell-sword.</string>
  <string id="6091394">I could have been so much more. I could have been a templar.</string>
  <string id="6091406">The city's in chaos, to be sure. But we're maintaining order. For now.</string>
  <string id="6091407">It's a bad day to be a guard. We'll muddle through.</string>
  <string id="6091408">Kirkwall's unraveling at the seams. I have no idea what we can do.</string>
  <string id="6091412">I haven't forgotten you, Champion. I owe you my life.</string>
  <string id="6091413">But now, more than ever, the city needs your help.</string>
  <string id="6091608">Sandal's Store</string>
  <string id="6091622">Sandal's Enchantments</string>
  <string id="6091640">You're here rather often, Serah Hawke. A good influence, I think.</string>
  <string id="6091644">Go away. My father may feel the need to hire your kind, but I don't have to like it.</string>
  <string id="6091659">Player Home</string>
  <string id="6091660">Player Home</string>
  <string id="6091678">I still accept no blame for defending Qunari. And I don't miss the kinship of the people who oppose what I believe.</string>
  <string id="6091682">The Arishok asked for me. I think they're a headache, but so are many people.</string>
  <string id="6091683">I don't like or hate Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6091684">Then you've already treated them with more grace than most.</string>
  <string id="6091687">Mere existence should not be an offense—no matter how they challenge the Chantry.</string>
  <string id="6091688">Kinship is the least of your worries if you stand with the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6091689">You're defending heretics.</string>
  <string id="6091690">If I am lost to the Maker for refusing to hate someone, for finding beauty in the other...</string>
  <string id="6091693">Well, perhaps the Maker is the one who is not worthy of me.</string>
  <string id="6091694">You're determined to be a thorn in someone's side. Good for you.</string>
  <string id="6091695">Never take the popular stance.</string>
  <string id="6091696">I'm the son of the viscount. My actions are dissected no matter what I believe. I may as well try to do some good.</string>
  <string id="6091699">If I offend, well—some people try very hard to be offended.</string>
  <string id="6091703">Shouldn't be rude to strangers. You'll get hurt.</string>
  <string id="6091704">You're the viscount's brat?</string>
  <string id="6091705">I've been hurt. That's how I know you're a thug, probably told to find any excuse to attack the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6091708">I didn't picture Dumar's son being so rude.</string>
  <string id="6091709">You're the viscount's son?</string>
  <string id="6091710">Shameful, isn't it? How I don't mindlessly repeat the mistakes of my father?</string>
  <string id="6091713">Well, nice to meet you too. And your problem with me is...?</string>
  <string id="6091714">What's your problem?</string>
  <string id="6091715">My father has dealt with the imagined Qunari threat before, and his first response was armed thugs.</string>
  <string id="6091720">Ooh, what's all this?</string>
  <string id="6091823">Don't botch this.</string>
  <string id="6091826">You worry about your part, I'll worry about mine.</string>
  <string id="6091829">Are you ready?</string>
  <string id="6091832">Yes, I think so.</string>
  <string id="6091835">Now, this needs to be convincing. And you'll need to get creative—call me names, even hit me.</string>
  <string id="6091838">Stick with it, no matter what I do. Velasco's a clever son of a bitch. If you waver, he'll notice.</string>
  <string id="6091839">I don't know if I can pull this off.</string>
  <string id="6091840">I'm not sure about this.</string>
  <string id="6091841">I'll make it convincing, not to worry.</string>
  <string id="6091842">This will be fun.</string>
  <string id="6091846">What—?</string>
  <string id="6091849">Gasps</string>
  <string id="6091852">I hope you have a good reason for interrupting my private time.</string>
  <string id="6091855">I brought you a new plaything. She's much less timid.</string>
  <string id="6091861">I have a present for Castillon.</string>
  <string id="6091870">This wasn't the plan! We were going to kill him!</string>
  <string id="6091874">Remember that time you ran off with the Tome of Koslun? This is like that, only funnier.</string>
  <string id="6091875">Change of plans.</string>
  <string id="6091876">Grunts</string>
  <string id="6091882">I've waited a long time to do that.</string>
  <string id="6091883">It's better this way. I hope you understand.</string>
  <string id="6091884">I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6091885">Spits</string>
  <string id="6091888">You backstabbing little shit! You'd better start sleeping with one eye open!</string>

  <string id="6091957">You! I knew the bitch was up to something! Kill them!</string>
  <string id="6091961">Velasco sent word to Castillon. He's on his way.</string>
  <string id="6091964">Let's look around first. I want to know why he's in Kirkwall.</string>

  <string id="6092033">This is not the time.</string>
  <string id="6092051">And Velasco told me you were all tied up, a lovely present just waiting to be opened.</string>
  <string id="6092054">I see he's paid for that little mistake. What a pretty smear he makes.</string>
  <string id="6092057">Well played, Isabela. Crossed and double-crossed.</string>
  <string id="6092063">You want to talk? Maybe we should talk about these documents. Slavery in the Free Marches? They're not going to like that.</string>
  <string id="6092070">Get to the point.</string>
  <string id="6092073">Give me your ship, and your word to leave me alone, and you can take these papers and go.</string>
  <string id="6092077">What happened to getting rid of Castillon?</string>
  <string id="6092078">Why the change of heart?</string>
  <string id="6092079">I want his ship. I saw her docked in the harbor. She's new, fast, and I want her.</string>
  <string id="6092080">Are you insane?</string>
  <string id="6092081">What's gotten into you?</string>
  <string id="6092082">See reason, Sister. I don't want to fight you.</string>
  <string id="6092085">See reason, Brother. I don't want to fight you.</string>
  <string id="6092089">If you want the ship, can't we just kill him and take it?</string>
  <string id="6092090">Don't you want to kill him?</string>
  <string id="6092091">You don't just kill a man and take his ship. That's crude and amateurish!</string>
  <string id="6092094">How will he tell everyone how I bested him if he's dead?</string>
  <string id="6092098">Can you trust him? He trades people for money!</string>
  <string id="6092099">What is his word worth?</string>
  <string id="6092100">Castillon's a businessman, and this is a business deal. He'll keep his end of the bargain.</string>
  <string id="6092110">I see I wasn't the only one played today.</string>
  <string id="6092116">Give me the documents, and you can have the ship. And you will never hear from me again.</string>
  <string id="6092119">Swear it.</string>
  <string id="6092122">I swear it on my mother's grave.</string>
  <string id="6092125">Give me the documents.</string>
  <string id="6092126">Castillon dies here today, if I have anything to say about it.</string>
  <string id="6092127">No, the slaver dies.</string>
  <string id="6092128">You've made your decision, Isabela. Do as you wish.</string>
  <string id="6092129">If that's the way you want it.</string>
  <string id="6092130">Chuckles Enough with the blackmail then. Let's settle this like civilized people.</string>
  <string id="6092134">The ship is yours. Let me say, my dear, that you would make a remarkable ally for any man able to tame you.</string>
  <string id="6092137">Our business is hereby concluded. Forever. Be well, Isabela.</string>
  <string id="6092140">I guess we won't be friends.</string>
  <string id="6092141">So, can I go in?</string>
  <string id="6092148">This is going to come back to bite you. You know that, right?</string>
  <string id="6092151">I've got the fastest ship on the ocean. It's got to catch me in order to bite me.</string>
  <string id="6092152">This habit you have of changing things without telling me? It needs to stop.</string>
  <string id="6092153">He didn't deserve to walk free.</string>
  <string id="6092163">He'll get what's coming to him, someday. Doesn't need to be at my hand.</string>
  <string id="6092164">I'm led to believe that both Huon and Evelina are dead. Unfortunate but necessary.</string>
  <string id="6092167">At least this is over.</string>
  <string id="6092168">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="6092169">Your willingness to help does you credit.</string>
  <string id="6092172">I am relieved. I was expecting resistance, after that debacle at the market.</string>
  <string id="6092175">I see. After your support in the market, I must admit I had hoped for better.</string>
  <string id="6092178">You do anything to her and I'll make you pay.</string>
  <string id="6092179">Don't you threaten her.</string>
  <string id="6092180">Bethany is no part of this.</string>
  <string id="6092181">Why bring her up?</string>
  <string id="6092182">My sister's name is Midge. She still lives in Ferelden.</string>
  <string id="6092183">Never heard of her.</string>
  <string id="6092184">Chuckles</string>
  <string id="6092187">Your sister is an exemplary mage. I bring her up only to illustrate the point that I do not believe their kind are all the same.</string>
  <string id="6092190">If these fugitives harm this city, the people will turn against the Circle, and that does affect your sister.</string>
  <string id="6092193">If I'm going to do this, I'll do it my way.</string>
  <string id="6092194">And if they don't?</string>
  <string id="6092195">You aren't afraid of what I'll do?</string>
  <string id="6092196">And if they don't?</string>
  <string id="6092197">Seems like you're giving me a lot of rope. Trying to hang me with it?</string>
  <string id="6092198">And if they don't?</string>
  <string id="6092199">I'm trying to solve a difficult problem in as gentle a fashion as I dare.</string>
  <string id="6092202">You're not leaving me much choice.</string>
  <string id="6092203">Very well.</string>
  <string id="6092205">It seems I will have to search harder. Orsino cannot evade me forever.</string>
  <string id="6092208">It disturbs me to think how its insidious influence has worked its way throughout this tower. The grand cleric must be made to see!</string>
  <string id="6092214">My own knight-captain falls prey to the influence of blood magic.</string>
  <string id="6092217">You all have! You're all weak, allowing the mages to control your minds, to turn you against me!</string>
  <string id="6092220">If Wilmod came back, he might know more about the other missing recruits.</string>
  <string id="6092221">Can I talk to Wilmod?</string>
  <string id="6092222">I bet he would.</string>
  <string id="6092227">But why? I love seeing your face when I do it.</string>
  <string id="6092228">How does it feel to have finally gotten the ship of your dreams?</string>
  <string id="6092229">So you got what you wanted.</string>
  <string id="6092230">Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere. Yet. I owe you all this, you know?</string>
  <string id="6092240">If you're looking to sail off, I think the sunset's that way.</string>
  <string id="6092241">When are you leaving?</string>
  <string id="6092242">You have your ship. Why are you still here?</string>
  <string id="6092243">Get going.</string>
  <string id="6092258">You planned this all along, didn't you?</string>
  <string id="6092261">As much as I plan anything. Which is to say... not much.</string>
  <string id="6092264">Look, I saw an opportunity, and I took it. You would've done the same.</string>
  <string id="6092265">I may have done it for a good cause. Not for a ship.</string>
  <string id="6092266">Not for this.</string>
  <string id="6092267">I wouldn't trust the word of a scumbag slaver.</string>
  <string id="6092268">I'm not that foolish.</string>
  <string id="6092269">I wouldn't have let him go for anything less than a flying ship.</string>
  <string id="6092270">Does the ship fly?</string>
  <string id="6092274">With what I've bumped into in Kirkwall, nothing surprises me any more.</string>
  <string id="6092275">Seen one demon, seen 'em all.</string>
  <string id="6092276">You shouldn't have been out here alone with him.</string>
  <string id="6092277">I'm glad I was here.</string>
  <string id="6092278">He's dead. Now let's figure out what happened.</string>
  <string id="6092279">Get over it.</string>
  <string id="6092280">You're no prize yourself, sweetheart.</string>
  <string id="6092283">I always keep my promises.</string>
  <string id="6092287">Quick! After it!</string>
  <string id="6092288">Everyone has priorities. You want to save the world. I wanted Castillon's ship.</string>
  <string id="6092291">If he has to walk free for me to get that ship, I can live with that.</string>
  <string id="6092292">It's useless talking to you.</string>
  <string id="6092293">Forget it.</string>
  <string id="6092294">Then don't.</string>
  <string id="6092299">I don't suppose I could have some time alone with her?</string>
  <string id="6092300">I think... I think I believe her.</string>
  <string id="6092302">Deep down you probably already regret what you've done.</string>
  <string id="6092303">No, you can't.</string>
  <string id="6092304">Don't tell me what I feel!</string>
  <string id="6092307">This is simple, all right? I wanted the ship, and I got it. It's done.</string>
  <string id="6092310">I don't want to talk about this. Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6092313">Castillon's free because you couldn't put aside your petty desires.</string>
  <string id="6092314">You're selfish.</string>
  <string id="6092315">You— Groans Why do you have to make everything so flaming complicated all the time?</string>

  <string id="6092340">I just want to get to know her better.</string>
  <string id="6092341">I don't know. She sounds so earnest.</string>
  <string id="6092342">Answer one of my questions first.</string>
  <string id="6092354">I... will not... obey... you!</string>
  <string id="6092357">How did she...? What did she...?</string>
  <string id="6092360">That's just wonderful. Maybe we can find answers somewhere around here.</string>
  <string id="6092361">That had to be blood magic.</string>
  <string id="6092364">Perhaps we can find answers somewhere in here.</string>
  <string id="6092365">You could have changed the world for the better, and you chose not to. For a pile of wood and ropes.</string>
  <string id="6092371">I do owe her a debt.</string>
  <string id="6092372">Are you going to teach me this rite for the departed?</string>
  <string id="6092377">But she has chosen a new path. Please, guide her safely from here. </string>
  <string id="6092378">Ugh! Now what am I supposed to do with these useless documents?</string>
  <string id="6092381">I hate to state the obvious but... I could use them.</string>
  <string id="6092384">Fine. Take the blasted things. Go... dispense justice, or whatever.</string>
  <string id="6092395">Do the Qunari generally keep you updated?</string>
  <string id="6092396">You're sure they're missing?</string>
  <string id="6092397">Qunari do not disappear. They know we watch, and they are not shy about their movement.</string>
  <string id="6092400">Speak to Seneschal Bran. He has details that show how damning this is.</string>
  <string id="6092404">Speak with Seneschal Bran. Then you will see why I cannot trust anyone else with this.</string>
  <string id="6092407">I'll make him talk.</string>
  <string id="6092408">I don't mess with the Wardens.</string>
  <string id="6092409">Fine. Let's do it your way.</string>
  <string id="6092410">I'll make him talk.</string>
  <string id="6092411">I don't mess with the Wardens.</string>
  <string id="6092412">Fine. Let's do it your way.</string>
  <string id="6092418">Now, to present this mess to the viscount.</string>
  <string id="6092421">All right. Time to bring this mess to the viscount's attention.</string>
  <string id="6092465">Has anyone reported this to the Qunari?</string>
  <string id="6092466">Does the Arishok know?</string>
  <string id="6092467">Maker, no. I'd be signing the messenger's death warrant.</string>
  <string id="6092470">He'll find out soon enough, of course. And when he does, the viscount is rightly concerned that the illusion of peace will dissolve.</string>
  <string id="6092471">I'm having a hard time picturing the abduction of a Qunari entourage.</string>
  <string id="6092472">Were they vulnerable somehow?</string>
  <string id="6092476">Unfortunately, they were not at their best. Their swords were tied into their sheaths. As I advised.</string>
  <string id="6092479">It seemed a respectful compromise. Even I know you cannot separate a Qunari from his weapon.</string>
  <string id="6092490">I can't believe you just lost me a ship.</string>
  <string id="6092491">Goodbye, Sister.</string>
  <string id="6092492">Give it time. Eventually, the truth will sink in.</string>
  <string id="6092493">Can't believe it?</string>
  <string id="6092494">You can build new ships, but an opportunity like that is rare.</string>
  <string id="6092495">There will be other ships.</string>
  <string id="6092496">Stop thinking about yourself.</string>
  <string id="6092497">Selfish wench.</string>
  <string id="6092498">You know Castillon didn't deserve to walk free.</string>
  <string id="6092501">This was my decision.</string>
  <string id="6092504">It was my life he threatened. If I can live with him walking free, why can't you?</string>
  <string id="6092505">You don't want to live with that. You would have regretted it.</string>
  <string id="6092506">You're wrong, Isabela.</string>
  <string id="6092507">Don't tell me what I would have felt!</string>
  <string id="6092510">It's about the slaves he sold and the people he's hurt. You know that better than I do.</string>
  <string id="6092511">It's not about me or you.</string>
  <string id="6092512">After all we've been through, together, how could you do that to me?</string>
  <string id="6092513">Think about it. You know he didn't deserve to walk.</string>
  <string id="6092514">I did what was right.</string>
  <string id="6092515">Sighs No, he didn't.</string>
  <string id="6092522">You trusted my turncoat of a brother but thought talking to us was risky? That's idiotic!</string>
  <string id="6092547">Let me get directly to the point: there is a conspiracy afoot within the Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6092550">You mentioned a conspiracy afoot?</string>
  <string id="6092551">What is this conspiracy?</string>
  <string id="6092552">Did you call me here to rant?</string>
  <string id="6092553">How does this involve me?</string>
  <string id="6092554">No. I brought you here because I need your help.</string>
  <string id="6092557">Is there something you need from me, Knight-Commander?</string>
  <string id="6092558">How does this involve me?</string>
  <string id="6092559">I'm assuming at some point you'll get to my part in this?</string>
  <string id="6092560">How does this involve me?</string>
  <string id="6092561">There might be no conspiracy at all.</string>
  <string id="6092562">Maybe they're right.</string>
  <string id="6092563">So you're the only one who knows the truth?</string>
  <string id="6092564">Maybe they're right.</string>
  <string id="6092565">So everyone else is wrong, even though you have no proof?</string>
  <string id="6092566">Maybe they're right.</string>
  <string id="6092569">But this is no fantasy. I am not imagining these events, and I will not pretend they don't exist.</string>
  <string id="6092572">I have demanded Orsino provide more detailed accounts, but he refuses. Either he is incompetent or involved—neither is acceptable.</string>
  <string id="6092573">Isn't it the first enchanter's job to work with you?</string>
  <string id="6092574">Why would he refuse?</string>
  <string id="6092575">It is Orsino's job to advocate for his mages, as well.</string>
  <string id="6092578">He claims I am being unreasonable, and so far he has persuaded the grand cleric to agree.</string>
  <string id="6092579">If you're trying to convince me, you're failing.</string>
  <string id="6092580">I don't believe you.</string>
  <string id="6092581">Sorry, but I'm with everyone else on this one.</string>
  <string id="6092582">I don't believe you.</string>
  <string id="6092583">Does the word unbalanced mean anything to you?</string>
  <string id="6092584">I don't believe you.</string>
  <string id="6092585">I'm not asking you to believe, Champion. In fact, your skepticism may prove more convincing than my certainty.</string>
  <string id="6092588">You are respected, Champion, a neutral party whose word even Orsino cannot question. You can convince her Grace whereas I cannot.</string>
  <string id="6092589">Where do I start?</string>
  <string id="6092590">Very well.</string>
  <string id="6092591">I've yet to hear why I should get involved.</string>
  <string id="6092592">Why should I?</string>
  <string id="6092593">Perhaps they said, I shouldn't get involved. This has nothing to do with me.</string>
  <string id="6092596">Apathy brings suffering to the innocent. You should know that lesson better than anyone.</string>
  <string id="6092597">Maybe you have a point.</string>
  <string id="6092598">You're right.</string>
  <string id="6092599">One I wish I did not have to make.</string>
  <string id="6092602">You have a lot of nerve trying to use my mother's memory like that.</string>
  <string id="6092603">How dare you.</string>
  <string id="6092604">It's a painful memory, I know. But it is also one that serves to remind us of what is important.</string>
  <string id="6092607">The only innocents being threatened here are the mages.</string>
  <string id="6092608">This is nothing like that.</string>
  <string id="6092609">All I ask is that you look into this, Champion. Others will respect your findings, as will I.</string>
  <string id="6092612">What if the evidence I find doesn't prove what you want it to?</string>
  <string id="6092613">And if you're wrong?</string>
  <string id="6092621">Raider Ambusher</string>
  <string id="6093136">Please, send for Viscount Dumar.</string>
  <string id="6093180">Great plan, until people start dying in a war with the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6093183">Do that and we can all finally see what this conspiracy consists of.</string>
  <string id="6093200">The grand cleric trusts her stewards to enact the wishes of the Maker.</string>
  <string id="6093253">And you know this how?</string>
  <string id="6093256">And he is what to you?</string>
  <string id="6093300">Stubborn... All right, Serah Hawke, if you won't abandon this. Let me offer you something.</string>
  <string id="6093303">Athenril... I guess you might call her a smuggler.</string>
  <string id="6093462">Are you ready?</string>
  <string id="6093465">No!</string>
  <string id="6093468">How else will mages ever master themselves? You'll understand, Anders.</string>
  <string id="6093471">As soon as the templars teach you to control yourself.</string>
  <string id="6093477">This is the apostate.</string>
  <string id="6093480">No!</string>
  <string id="6093481">Oh thank you! I knew the Champion of Kirkwall would come to my aid.</string>
  <string id="6093485">What about me?</string>
  <string id="6093486">Don't talk as if I'm not here.</string>
  <string id="6093489">I hope you haven't forgotten about me.</string>
  <string id="6093492">Um, hello? I'm standing right here.</string>
  <string id="6093495">We just cut down a swath of men. We're still covered in blood!</string>
  <string id="6093496">That's disgusting.</string>
  <string id="6093497">He didn't mention how handsome.</string>
  <string id="6093498">Handsome indeed.</string>
  <string id="6093499">I like your list of options... but does it have to be in that order?</string>
  <string id="6093500">I choose manhandling.</string>
  <string id="6093505">Not in this lifetime.</string>
  <string id="6093506">Absolutely not.</string>
  <string id="6093520">I get the feeling you're in trouble.</string>
  <string id="6093521">Did you do something wrong?</string>
  <string id="6093522">It's not like that! Not exactly, anyway.</string>
  <string id="6093523">You seem awfully nervous.</string>
  <string id="6093524">What's the matter?</string>
  <string id="6093526">What do we have to do with the amulet?</string>
  <string id="6093527">Tell me about this rite.</string>
  <string id="6093528">Do you know the witch who sent me here?</string>
  <string id="6093529">Have you met Asha'bellanar?</string>
  <string id="6093530">I take it you've been expecting me to bring this amulet for some time?</string>
  <string id="6093531">You know about my task?</string>
  <string id="6093532">Let's get this over with.</string>
  <string id="6093533">I'm ready to go.</string>
  <string id="6093534">I need a few minutes to prepare.</string>
  <string id="6093535">I need supplies.</string>
  <string id="6093536">Do you think he was possessed?</string>
  <string id="6093537">Was he an abomination?</string>
  <string id="6093538">Normally, we only worry that mages will fall victim to possession.</string>
  <string id="6093541">I have heard of blood mages, or demons in solid form, who could summon others into unwilling hosts.</string>
  <string id="6093544">But I had not thought one of our own would be susceptible.</string>
  <string id="6093547">I have been conducting an investigation of some of our recruits who have gone missing. Wilmod was the first to return.</string>
  <string id="6093550">I had hoped to confront him quietly, out of sight.</string>
  <string id="6093551">I was trying to find another recruit, a friend of Wilmod's. Do you know where Keran is?</string>
  <string id="6093552">I'm looking for Keran.</string>
  <string id="6093555">Maybe next time you should try confronting him loudly, in public.</string>
  <string id="6093556">That didn't work so well.</string>
  <string id="6093557">Your other recruits are still at risk. We must find them.</string>
  <string id="6093558">We must stop this.</string>
  <string id="6093560">You're on your own.</string>
  <string id="6093561">This isn't my fight.</string>
  <string id="6093562">I'm not putting my life on the line for nothing.</string>
  <string id="6093563">For a price, I'll help.</string>
  <string id="6093566">The Keeper and I have disagreements, but it will sort itself out in time.</string>
  <string id="6093570">Got a minute, Hawke?</string>
  <string id="6093573">I know this is ancient history, but remember that Hightown house Bartrand barricaded himself in?</string>
  <string id="6093576">Bartrand doesn't exactly need the place, now that he's in the sanitarium. I've been trying to sell it.</string>
  <string id="6093577">No point in keeping a house for a dead man. I've been trying to get rid of the place for ages now.</string>
  <string id="6093578">Story time, Hawke! You might want to find a seat for this.</string>
  <string id="6093581">No shit, there I was: I'd found the fortified mansion where my brother was hiding, and all by my lonesome, I broke inside.</string>
  <string id="6093584">The place was in shambles. Corpses in the halls, dead rats the size of Qunari. Every soul dead.</string>
  <string id="6093585">Just tell me what this is about.</string>
  <string id="6093586">Skip to the point, Varric.</string>
  <string id="6093587">I'm getting there. You need to develop a sense of pacing, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6093590">How did they all die?</string>
  <string id="6093591">What happened?</string>
  <string id="6093592">Well, that's the creepy part.</string>
  <string id="6093595">Are you pulling my leg?</string>
  <string id="6093596">Sounds far-fetched.</string>
  <string id="6093597">Maker's truth! I only found my brother's steward alive, locked in a back room.</string>
  <string id="6093600">He said Bartrand went crazy and killed everyone, including himself.</string>
  <string id="6093601">That bastard deserved to die.</string>
  <string id="6093602">Good.</string>
  <string id="6093603">Can't argue with that. I just wish he'd waited so I could get answers out of him first.</string>
  <string id="6093606">I can't imagine finding something like that. How are you holding up?</string>
  <string id="6093607">I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6093608">Don't worry about me. After what Bartrand did, I wasn't exactly planning on giving him a hug and talking things out.</string>
  <string id="6093611">If this is another of your stories and you're just saying this to make me feel terrible, it's working.</string>
  <string id="6093612">Are you serious?</string>
  <string id="6093613">I wish I'd made this up for dramatic effect, but it's the Maker's own truth.</string>
  <string id="6093616">At any rate, now I'm stuck trying to get rid of a mansion that was the site of a few dozen grisly murders.</string>
  <string id="6093617">I'm sure that'll go well.</string>
  <string id="6093618">Good luck.</string>
  <string id="6093619">Yeah, it's been a picnic so far.</string>
  <string id="6093622">I assume there's not much interest in it.</string>
  <string id="6093623">That could be tricky.</string>
  <string id="6093624">No. There's a really small number of people who want expensive, blood-covered houses in Hightown.</string>
  <string id="6093627">I can only imagine there's a huge market for the homes of deranged killers.</string>
  <string id="6093628">Buyers will be thrilled.</string>
  <string id="6093629">The creepy sort of people who are interested are generally not the ones with the coin to take it off my hands.</string>
  <string id="6093632">I found a minor noble in Rivain who bought the place sight unseen. But now there's a problem.</string>
  <string id="6093635">They say the place is... haunted.</string>
  <string id="6093636">Bartrand's atrocities must have weakened the barrier between this world and the Fade.</string>
  <string id="6093637">The Veil was torn.</string>
  <string id="6093638">Maker, I hope not! I don't think I can fix the Veil through applied use of force.</string>
  <string id="6093641">I don't see how that's your problem.</string>
  <string id="6093642">So?</string>
  <string id="6093643">Anyone who knew the house's history would attribute every noise in the night to ghosts.</string>
  <string id="6093644">That's not surprising.</string>
  <string id="6093645">If they hadn't seen the place, I'd expect the first complaint to be about the corpses in the hall.</string>
  <string id="6093646">Is that all?</string>
  <string id="6093647">I may have neglected to mention the mansion's... colorful past to the buyer.</string>
  <string id="6093650">They've noticed some minor problems: Voices whispering in the walls, apparitions, things moving on their own.</string>
  <string id="6093653">My hope is it's a relic Bartrand brought back from the Deep Roads. We smash it, and the haunting stops.</string>
  <string id="6093654">What happens if we do nothing?</string>
  <string id="6093655">And if we don't?</string>
  <string id="6093656">Best case? They drag me before the seneschal and accuse me of fraud.</string>
  <string id="6093659">The worst case involves Antivan Crows.</string>
  <string id="6093660">I'm not an expert on hauntings, but what if smashing something does not make the problem go away?</string>
  <string id="6093661">What if that doesn't fix it?</string>
  <string id="6093662">Ah... that's where things get tricky.</string>
  <string id="6093665">You're a mage! You must know something about... weird shit.</string>
  <string id="6093668">You come from a family with magic, Hawke. You must have experience dealing with... weird.</string>
  <string id="6093671">I'm sure you'll be able to figure something out that will help.</string>
  <string id="6093672">Can't you do this yourself?</string>
  <string id="6093673">Why do you need me?</string>
  <string id="6093674">Hawke, I'm a businessman. Now and then, I shoot people. I don't know anything about ghosts or magic.</string>
  <string id="6093677">It's entirely possible that even if I find the thing that's causing the trouble, I won't be able to stop it on my own.</string>
  <string id="6093678">Very well. We'll investigate the mansion. Again.</string>
  <string id="6093679">We'll take care of it.</string>
  <string id="6093680">Thanks, Hawke. I knew you wouldn't let me down.</string>
  <string id="6093681">I've got a lot to do right now, Varric. You'll have to sort this out on your own this time.</string>
  <string id="6093682">We don't have time.</string>
  <string id="6093683">I didn't think you'd let me down, Hawke. First time for everything.</string>
  <string id="6093684">Fine, we'll take care of it.</string>
  <string id="6093685">We'll take care of it.</string>
  <string id="6093686">Thanks, Hawke. I appreciate it.</string>
  <string id="6093687">You can handle this on your own just like last time.</string>
  <string id="6093688">We don't have time.</string>
  <string id="6093689">Right, there's a shocker.</string>
  <string id="6093692">This should be fun.</string>
  <string id="6093693">Don't be so nervous.</string>
  <string id="6093694">You're only the second human I've seen up close. Last time was not a happy memory.</string>
  <string id="6093695">I've never met a human before. Dalish mothers frighten their children with stories about you, you know.</string>
  <string id="6093730">Where there's one demon, there's usually more. Where do we start digging?</string>
  <string id="6093731">Let's hunt some demons.</string>
  <string id="6093732">He also disappeared.</string>
  <string id="6093735">I fear it is time to widen this investigation. My discretion may have cost me one of our best recruits, Wilmod's friend Keran.</string>
  <string id="6093738">They were last seen together at the Blooming Rose.</string>
  <string id="6093741">But I had no luck interrogating the, ah, young ladies there. I doubt they know anything of magic or demons.</string>
  <string id="6093742">I'll speak with them. You never know how much you can learn from pillow talk.</string>
  <string id="6093743">Maybe I'll have better luck.</string>
  <string id="6093744">I'd be willing to search there.</string>
  <string id="6093745">The brothel, huh?</string>
  <string id="6093746">Don't be fooled by a pretty face.</string>
  <string id="6093747">I don't trust them.</string>
  <string id="6093748">They fear we would shut them down if they admit to serving our recruits. Perhaps you could talk to them?</string>
  <string id="6093766">A Grey Warden took away one of our hunters to fight the darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6093769">I heard he fought the Archdemon. I wonder what's become of him.</string>
  <string id="6093770">I heard she fought the Archdemon. I wonder what's become of her.</string>
  <string id="6093773">Not you, personally, of course. I'm sure they don't have any tales about you. Or not scary ones, at least.</string>
  <string id="6093776">Not that you're not notable enough to have a story... I'll just shut up now.</string>
  <string id="6093777">The Keeper said you came from Ferelden. I spent most of my life there. We only came north a few years ago.</string>
  <string id="6093790">The Order would truly be in your debt if you helped us with this.</string>
  <string id="6093793">No one at the brothel will speak with me for fear I would shut them down for serving our recruits.</string>
  <string id="6093798">It is the only lead we have on Keran.</string>
  <string id="6093801">Our recruits may be in grave danger, to their bodies and souls.</string>
  <string id="6093804">If you learn what manner of creature did this to Wilmod, please come tell me in the Gallows. I will ensure you are rewarded.</string>
  <string id="6093808">You killed them all by yourself!</string>
  <string id="6093811">This is far off the beaten path. What brought you here?</string>
  <string id="6093812">How did you end up here?</string>
  <string id="6093813">Ships have been going missing. A local told me raiders were lighting bonfires here on foggy days.</string>
  <string id="6093816">They were tricking ships into running ashore, thinking they'd reached Kirkwall. Then they'd plunder them.</string>
  <string id="6093819">When we arrived, we found Evets Marauders. If it weren't for you...</string>
  <string id="6093820">I'm glad our paths crossed. Otherwise this might have had a very different ending.</string>
  <string id="6093821">Happy to help.</string>
  <string id="6093822">Marauders slain, guardsmen rescued. It's what I do.</string>
  <string id="6093823">I do good work.</string>
  <string id="6093824">If that's it, I have other things to do.</string>
  <string id="6093825">We done here?</string>
  <string id="6093826">There's a massive bounty offered on the Marauders. Help us kill them, and you'll be rich.</string>
  <string id="6093827">Blast!</string>
  <string id="6093840">Have you been in the Free Marches long? Do you like it here?</string>
  <string id="6093841">The Blight forced me here. Wasn't my choice.</string>
  <string id="6093842">I had to come here.</string>
  <string id="6093843">I've lived in Kirkwall for a year now. It's a good place to get a fresh start.</string>
  <string id="6093844">There's opportunity.</string>
  <string id="6093845">I miss the cold. And the dirt. Kirkwall's not brown enough for me. But hey, no darkspawn!</string>
  <string id="6093846">Could be worse.</string>
  <string id="6093853">Will you kill me for this?</string>
  <string id="6093854">Take Flemeth's amulet to the altar at the top of Sundermount.</string>
  <string id="6093855">Return the amulet to Keeper Marethari in the Dalish camp.</string>
  <string id="6093857">Merrill has arrived safely in the alienage.</string>
  <string id="6093859">I— Anders, what did you do?</string>
  <string id="6093862">It's like... you brought a piece of the Fade into this world.</string>
  <string id="6093865">I had already forgotten what that feels like.</string>
  <string id="6093866">I thought the Tranquil were cut off from the Fade forever.</string>
  <string id="6093867">But you're Tranquil.</string>
  <string id="6093868">When you're Tranquil, you never think on your life before.</string>
  <string id="6093871">But... it's like the Fade itself is inside Anders. Burning like a sun.</string>
  <string id="6093874">What did you do? Not the Fade part—the angry glowing bit.</string>
  <string id="6093875">That's a good question.</string>
  <string id="6093876">It's like a gateway to the Fade inside you. Glowing like a beacon.</string>
  <string id="6093879">I have... some unique circumstances, yes. But, Karl, what happened? How did they get you?</string>
  <string id="6093882"> The templars here are far more vigilant than in Ferelden. They found a letter I was writing you...</string>
  <string id="6093885">This bastard ratted you out to the templars.</string>
  <string id="6093886">He tricked you, Anders.</string>
  <string id="6093887">He wasn't himself. Being made Tranquil takes away everything human inside you.</string>
  <string id="6093890">He wasn't capable of caring for me anymore. He could only follow the rules.</string>
  <string id="6093893">You cannot imagine it, Anders. All the color, all the music in the world, gone.</string>
  <string id="6093896">I would gladly give up my magic, but this? I'll never be whole again.</string>
  <string id="6093899">Please, kill me before I forget again! I don't know how you brought it back, but it's fading.</string>
  <string id="6093900">Maybe we can find a cure.</string>
  <string id="6093901">Is there no other way?</string>
  <string id="6093902">I would rather die than be Tranquil. Help him.</string>
  <string id="6093903">Do as he asks.</string>
  <string id="6093904">The Tranquil I've met seem content with their lot. Maybe it's not that bad.</string>
  <string id="6093905">Don't kill him.</string>
  <string id="6093908">Karl, no—</string>
  <string id="6093909">My sister calls being Tranquil a fate worse than death. Give him peace.</string>
  <string id="6093910">Do as he asks.</string>
  <string id="6093913">I understand. We wouldn't have come here by choice either.</string>
  <string id="6093914">Really? I hope you're right.</string>
  <string id="6093915">Ferelden wasn't that brown! The dirt and muck gave it character.</string>

  <string id="6093954">Bartrand Killed</string>
  <string id="6093961">It's a funeral, of sorts. I'll perform it when we get to the mountaintop.</string>
  <string id="6093964">Getting there is the tricky part. Our hunters haven't been able to reach the summit. Dark things are about.</string>
  <string id="6093965">No, not personally. My people tell stories of her, though.</string>
  <string id="6093966">The Keeper brought us here to wait for you. I don't know much more than that.</string>
  <string id="6093968">Of course. Best if we hurry, though. I'd like to be away from here.</string>
  <string id="6093972">You're very lucky. Most people who meet Asha'bellanar wind up in little pieces... hanging from the trees.</string>
  <string id="6093975">I do know that you have Asha'bellanar's amulet, and we must bring it to the altar on the mountaintop. Nothing more.</string>
  <string id="6093987">Can you cure a beheading? The dreams of Tranquil mages are severed—there is nothing left of them to fix.</string>
  <string id="6093990">I would rather die a mage than live as a templar puppet.</string>
  <string id="6093993">I got here too late. I'm sorry, Karl. I'm so sorry.</string>
  <string id="6093996">You have no idea. Your emotions, your dreams, everything—stripped away on someone's whim!</string>
  <string id="6093999">If I were made Tranquil, I would wish for a friend compassionate enough to kill me.</string>
  <string id="6094002">Karl, I'm sorry—</string>
  <string id="6094005">Now! It's fading... Why do you look at me like that?</string>
  <string id="6094008">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="6094011">We should leave before more templars come.</string>
  <string id="6094013">If you go to Kirkwall, you'll be an apostate in a city full of templars.</string>
  <string id="6094014">Yet you risk the city's danger.</string>
  <string id="6094015">I know, but if I don't go to Kirkwall, I'll be alone. A solitary elf is easy prey for anyone.</string>
  <string id="6094018">In the city, I can get lost in the crowd.</string>
  <string id="6094023">Documents</string>
  <string id="6094087">You have been a good friend, better than I deserve.</string>
  <string id="6094088">Documents</string>

  <string id="6094096">Romance</string>
  <string id="6094194">Come to my house, Hawke. There's something I should probably show you.</string>
  <string id="6094195">Do you think we could stop by my house in the alienage? There's something I ought to show you.</string>
  <string id="6094268">You again. What do you want?</string>
  <string id="6094295">Gasps</string>
  <string id="6094305">He was that upset over a dish?</string>
  <string id="6094306">That's unexpected.</string>
  <string id="6094307">There's no way you're talking about the same Bartrand that I met.</string>
  <string id="6094308">You're making this up.</string>
  <string id="6094431">Merrill's Home</string>
  <string id="6094446">Leave Area</string>
  <string id="6094450">I'm worried about you. You're enjoying this a little too much.</string>
  <string id="6094451">You seem a little eager.</string>
  <string id="6094452">I am, aren't I? Giggles</string>
  <string id="6094455">Whatever you do, just make sure he takes me to Castillon. I'll leave a trail for you to follow.</string>
  <string id="6094458">Ordinarily, I'd have taunted Bartrand into an insensible rage. That day, though, I couldn't do it.</string>
  <string id="6094459">I don't think it was a dish to Bartrand.</string>
  <string id="6094460">Maker's truth! There were tears in his eyes! I never thought that was possible before.</string>
  <string id="6094461">Come on, haven't you ever wanted to slap me? Just a little?</string>
  <string id="6094464">Er... now you're making me nervous.</string>
  <string id="6094473">Get back here, you—! Grunts Skittish bitch.</string>
  <string id="6094476">Present for— What?</string>
  <string id="6094477">I'm the Champion of Kirkwall. I have to think about my reputation.</string>
  <string id="6094478">I can't be seen with you.</string>
  <string id="6094481">Are you insane?</string>
  <string id="6094484">Shut up.</string>
  <string id="6094485">That's enough from you.</string>
  <string id="6094486">How dare you?</string>
  <string id="6094489">I just want you out of the way.</string>
  <string id="6094490">You're too much trouble.</string>
  <string id="6094502">The lights! Mother, the lights!</string>
  <string id="6094503">How would you feel if I told you there might be a demon living in you? Just a small one.</string>
  <string id="6094506">Don't make any sudden moves, Keran. You could have a demon in you.</string>
  <string id="6094509">There's no easy way to say this, Keran. There's a chance you're inhabited by a demon.</string>
  <string id="6094512">If there's even the slightest chance you're possessed, the templars need to know.</string>
  <string id="6094513">I have to tell the templars.</string>
  <string id="6094514">The knight-commander needs vigilance and obedience in these trying times.</string>
  <string id="6094515">It is a great honor to serve the Order and the knight-commander.</string>
  <string id="6094516">I'm certain that Keran was discharged for good reason.</string>
  <string id="6094517">Keran is back. The knight-captain said that there will be no more recruits kidnapped.</string>
  <string id="6094518">The mages have spies in our order, I tell you. You can't trust anyone.</string>
  <string id="6094519">I hear the Qunari are kidnapping mages and doing peculiar things to them. Mark my words.</string>
  <string id="6094520">Keran was cast out of the order. No one will tell us why.</string>
  <string id="6094521">Keran's back. But the others? No one will say.</string>
  <string id="6094527">Always the demon thing. Can't you people say no?</string>
  <string id="6094530">Careful, Hawke. She may be an abomination.</string>
  <string id="6094533">How could you let a demon trick you into this? Were you taught nothing?</string>
  <string id="6094536">She must be an abomination. I think.</string>
  <string id="6094539">These mages always fall to the first demon's promise.</string>
  <string id="6094542">This demon-worship thing is a real turn-off.</string>
  <string id="6094545">She has given in to a demon's demands. It is in control now.</string>
  <string id="6094548">Most abominations aren't quite so open about being slaves to demons.</string>
  <string id="6094551">I am not some hopeless waif that ran crying to a demon—I sought them out and embraced them!</string>
  <string id="6094554">That's the wench we're looking for. Gut her!</string>
  <string id="6094561">I wouldn't advise talking with me, serah.</string>
  <string id="6094562">I dared question one of the knight-commander's orders.</string>
  <string id="6094563">Now I am a pariah. All for saying what a great many of us are feeling.</string>
  <string id="6094564">I fear the Templar Order here has lost its way.</string>
  <string id="6094565">I've been loyal to the Order. But the knight-commander doesn't make it easy.</string>
  <string id="6094605">Effective immediately, Keran, you are discharged from the Templar Order. Escort him from the grounds.</string>
  <string id="6094608">What? I was tortured. I've done nothing wrong!</string>
  <string id="6094611">Set a guard to watch him. Just in case.</string>
  <string id="6094628">Anders</string>

  <string id="6094668">Varric</string>
  <string id="6094673">This is Martin's cargo? It's... it's all poison. Illegal poison.</string>
  <string id="6094674">I wouldn't breathe that in, if I were you. Looks like Martin's trading in death.</string>
  <string id="6094675">I... I think that's venom. So much for going on the straight and narrow.</string>
  <string id="6094676">Poison. This has to be illegal. I knew we shouldn't have trusted that snake.</string>
  <string id="6094677">I believe that poison you hold is illegal, even in Tevinter. Martin has a lot to answer for.</string>
  <string id="6094678">Ooh. The Black Hand! A blend of twenty-seven toxic plant essences with a healthy dollop of cobra venom for that extra kick!</string>
  <string id="6094679">Why would anyone need so much poison? Is he planning to murder all of Kirkwall?</string>
  <string id="6094680">This is some potent stuff. You could wipe out all of Hightown with just one vial.</string>
  <string id="6094683">And I have a room at the Hanged Man, if you're looking for... company later.</string>
  <string id="6094684">Martin was transporting illegal poisons. I'll need an explanation for this.</string>
  <string id="6094687">That poison will kill a man in two breaths. Can I have it?</string>
  <string id="6094710">A true disaster. There is no pleasing anyone after this.</string>
  <string id="6094714">I wonder if actually warring with the Qunari would cause as much damage as this disaster?</string>
  <string id="6094717">The viscount appreciates your assistance. Now leave me.</string>
  <string id="6094718">The viscount will see no one. He has... cleared his schedule.</string>
  <string id="6094721">I would prefer that you were not involved at all, but that is neither here nor there.</string>
  <string id="6094722">It sounds like you don't want them found.</string>
  <string id="6094723">You seem reluctant to look.</string>
  <string id="6094724">I'm sure you have suspicions about what happened.</string>
  <string id="6094725">So what is known?</string>
  <string id="6094726">I don't need your opinion. Get to what you know.</string>
  <string id="6094727">Just get to the facts.</string>
  <string id="6094728">I am to help you, yes. Viscount Dumar would appreciate discretion in this matter.</string>
  <string id="6094731">I must think of what is best for the viscount's office. Bringing attention to such an incident benefits no one.</string>
  <string id="6094734">You would do nothing?</string>
  <string id="6094737">The Qunari are neutral hostiles at best. There is no relationship to salvage by... overextending ourselves on their behalf.</string>
  <string id="6094757">Why can't you surprise me in a normal way? With flowers, maybe, or a cake?</string>
  <string id="6094758">This is unexpected.</string>
  <string id="6094763">The delegate and his entourage could not be made to disappear without the knowledge of the city guard.</string>
  <string id="6094766">Have any failed to report?</string>
  <string id="6094769">Several. You should start with one of them.</string>
  <string id="6094772">Not coincidentally, a number of recent recruits have failed to report. You should start with one of them.</string>
  <string id="6094775">Although, where you find a swordsman so eager to sell his honor and duty, I'm sure I don't know.</string>
  <string id="6094778">The Hanged Man.</string>
  <string id="6094781">Hanged Man.</string>
  <string id="6094784">No doubt.</string>
  <string id="6094787">Obvious one, that.</string>
  <string id="6094790">Definitely.</string>
  <string id="6094793">Got to be.</string>
  <string id="6094796">Hanged Man.</string>
  <string id="6094799">Hanged Man.</string>
  <string id="6094802">Hanged Man.</string>
  <string id="6094805">Hanged Man.</string>
  <string id="6094808">No question.</string>
  <string id="6094811">Right. Then you know what to look for.</string>
  <string id="6094812">The Hanged Man.</string>
  <string id="6094815">The Hanged Man.</string>
  <string id="6094818">The Hanged Man.</string>
  <string id="6094821">The Hanged Man.</string>
  <string id="6094824">The Hanged Man.</string>
  <string id="6094827">The Hanged Man. Got to be.</string>
  <string id="6094833">Debug Fence</string>
  <string id="6094872">So, where would you start? If you were the starting type.</string>
  <string id="6094873">Do you have anything useful?</string>
  <string id="6094874">My concerns are well founded. This could not have escaped the notice of the city guard. Unless they were involved.</string>
  <string id="6094877">I would begin with the most obvious failure. It's clear the city guard has no excuse for allowing this. Unless they were involved.</string>
  <string id="6094891">I can't imagine this has occurred without notice. There is always a weak link.</string>
  <string id="6094894">Please keep this quiet. The viscount is under enough scrutiny as it is.</string>
  <string id="6094897">If you think investigating the Hanged Man will yield information on the missing Qunari, I suggest you get to it.</string>
  <string id="6094901">I am getting rid of him. Through peaceful means.</string>
  <string id="6094904">Coming from her, that's priceless.</string>
  <string id="6094907">I saw the ship docked in the harbor, Castillon. She is splendid. I want her.</string>
  <string id="6094940">What could go wrong? I'm sure everything will be fine!</string>
  <string id="6094944">Oh! Tell me you've decided to help retrieve my property after all! I'm desperate! I'm begging you!</string>
  <string id="6094948">Are you Anso?</string>
  <string id="6094951">Aaah!</string>
  <string id="6094954">Sweet mother of partha! You can't just run up on someone like that!</string>
  <string id="6094957">Are you... the human Athenril told me about? The one looking for work?</string>
  <string id="6094958">Are you... the one that mercenary told me about? The one looking for work?</string>
  <string id="6094959">I used to work with Athenril, if that's what you mean.</string>
  <string id="6094960">That's me.</string>
  <string id="6094961">I used to work with the Red Iron, if that's what you mean.</string>
  <string id="6094962">That's me.</string>
  <string id="6094963">Yes it is! What I mean, that is.</string>
  <string id="6094966">Did you think I was going to attack you?</string>
  <string id="6094967">Expecting someone else?</string>
  <string id="6094968">Oh! No, no! Or I hope not, anyhow!</string>
  <string id="6094971">Just tell me what you want.</string>
  <string id="6094972">Depends on the work.</string>
  <string id="6094973">Of course! Listen to me, babbling like a lyrium smuggler! Which I'm not.</string>
  <string id="6094976">My apologies, human. I haven't been on the surface very long. I keep thinking I'll fall up into that sky any minute!</string>
  <string id="6094979">Bartrand used to be like that. Got jumpy every time he stepped outside.</string>
  <string id="6094982">What a bizarre thing to be scared of.</string>
  <string id="6094985">I'd pay to see that.</string>
  <string id="6094988">Dwarves are funny.</string>
  <string id="6094991">But I digress! I need some help. Rather badly, in fact. Some product of mine has been... misplaced.</string>
  <string id="6094994">The men who were supposed to deliver it decided not to. If you retrieve my property, I could reward you handsomely...?</string>
  <string id="6094995">Just what did these men steal?</string>
  <string id="6094996">What kind of property?</string>
  <string id="6094997">Did I say steal? I don't know if I would go that far.</string>
  <string id="6095000">They seemed like perfectly reasonable smugglers. They smiled and everything!</string>
  <string id="6095003">The goods are valuable, however. And illegal. And my client wants them very, very badly! You know how these templars can be.</string>
  <string id="6095004">You're smuggling lyrium to the templars?</string>
  <string id="6095005">So it's lyrium?</string>
  <string id="6095006">Brave man.</string>
  <string id="6095009">Shh! By the Paragons, not so loudly!</string>
  <string id="6095012">My word! I'm not cut out for this. I should have taken that job sweeping stables like Mother insisted.</string>
  <string id="6095013">I'll get it back for you.</string>
  <string id="6095014">I'll do it.</string>
  <string id="6095015">Oh, thank goodness!</string>
  <string id="6095018">I don't run errands.</string>
  <string id="6095019">Forget it.</string>
  <string id="6095020">Nug droppings! Does nobody in this city wish to make coin? Now what will I do?</string>
  <string id="6095023">Sighs If you change your mind, please tell me. I'm desperate!</string>
  <string id="6095026">Make it worth my time, and I'll help you.</string>
  <string id="6095027">This better be worth it.</string>
  <string id="6095028">Oh, I will! Or I'll try to.</string>
  <string id="6095031">The gentlemen conduct their business at night in a little hovel within the alienage.</string>
  <string id="6095034">If you have to kill them, then I guess it can't be avoided. But I'm sure they'll be reasonable!</string>
  <string id="6095039">Wait!</string>
  <string id="6095048">Mind your manners. This is my territory.</string>
  <string id="6095061">Wounded Coast</string>
  <string id="6095063">Slaver Caverns</string>
  <string id="6095068">This is strange. I've never seen the alienage this quiet, even at night.</string>
  <string id="6095069">The alienage should not be this quiet.</string>
  <string id="6095070">It's a little quiet here tonight. Too quiet.</string>
  <string id="6095071">All the elves have run off to hide in their homes? That can't be good.</string>
  <string id="6095072">Seems a bit quiet in the alienage tonight, doesn't it?</string>
  <string id="6095073">Huh. It's so quiet you could hear a mouse fart.</string>
  <string id="6095074">When it's this quiet, that's when they attack. I'm just saying.</string>
  <string id="6095075">Seems a little too quiet tonight.</string>
  <string id="6095081">I've got some good news and some bad news...</string>
  <string id="6095084">What? What is it?</string>
  <string id="6095087">Good news, Keran is safe. Bad news, half of your recruits may have been possessed by demons.</string>
  <string id="6095090">Blood mages have infiltrated your ranks. They've been implanting your recruits with demons.</string>
  <string id="6095093">Sweet blood of Andraste!</string>
  <string id="6095096">D-Demons? Did you say something about the recruits and demons?</string>
  <string id="6095099">I didn't want to tell you, Macha. They... they were horrible. Those mages see the rest of us as ants to be crushed. </string>
  <string id="6095102">They won't stop until they've destroyed the Chantry and the templars forever.</string>
  <string id="6095103">Tarohne was crazy. Magic didn't make her that way.</string>
  <string id="6095104">Not all mages are like that.</string>
  <string id="6095105">Not all mages are like that.</string>
  <string id="6095106">Hey! I'm a mage!</string>
  <string id="6095107">True, not every mage gives in to temptation, but none are ever free of it.</string>
  <string id="6095110">Mages have been systematically abused by the templars for a thousand years.</string>
  <string id="6095111">It's the templars' fault.</string>
  <string id="6095112">How can you say that after what you've seen?</string>
  <string id="6095115">Wrong! This is no stuffy scholars' debate. This is the central fact of the world that Andraste recognized.</string>
  <string id="6095118">At any time, any mage could become a monster, from the lowest apprentice to the most seasoned enchanters.</string>
  <string id="6095121">Mages cannot be treated like people. They are not like you and me.</string>
  <string id="6095124">Surely that's a little harsh.</string>
  <string id="6095127">They are weapons. They have the power to light a city on fire in a fit of pique.</string>
  <string id="6095128">I admit, that does reduce their bargaining position. But there must be some middle ground.</string>
  <string id="6095129">There has to be a better way.</string>
  <string id="6095130">It does no good driving mages to blood magic as their only escape.</string>
  <string id="6095131">There has to be a better way.</string>
  <string id="6095132">Perhaps you're right. Perhaps mages need better education as to why the Chantry functions as it does.</string>
  <string id="6095135">Perhaps they would not go against the will of Andraste herself. I will look into it.</string>
  <string id="6095138">For now, Keran, unless it is proven you are free of demons, I must strip you of your commission immediately.</string>
  <string id="6095141">The templars have good reason to be vigilant.</string>
  <string id="6095142">You're right.</string>
  <string id="6095143">Keran, I'm afraid I must relieve you of your commission.</string>
  <string id="6095148">No! You can't really think that! Keran's fine. He's safe. </string>
  <string id="6095151">Please, ser. I tried to resist. I never took anything they offered.</string>
  <string id="6095154">I-I need this position or my sister can't eat. I've been training for five years!</string>
  <string id="6095155">Still, you have done much for us by stopping these blood mages. I will heed your request.</string>
  <string id="6095158">Please, Knight-Captain. I'll prove I'm loyal. Ask me anything.</string>
  <string id="6095161">My brother's a good man, ser. He would never succumb to a demon.</string>
  <string id="6095164">Perhaps it is best to keep our enemies close. We can watch him far better here than in the city. So be it.</string>
  <string id="6095167">If he has shown no sign of demonic possession in ten years' time, Keran will become eligible for full knighthood.</string>
  <string id="6095170">Thank you, serah. Again. But without a full knighthood, Keran's pay is so small... I do not know if I can reward you as you deserve—</string>
  <string id="6095173">I will handle that, miss.</string>
  <string id="6095176">No! Why bother to save me if you're just going to cast me into the streets?</string>
  <string id="6095179">My brother is a good man, serah! You cannot truly think this of him!</string>
  <string id="6095219">They were clearly expecting someone.</string>
  <string id="6095222">Someone must have tipped them off.</string>
  <string id="6095225">Were they expecting us? It seemed that way.</string>
  <string id="6095228">Surprise, surprise. It seemed too easy.</string>
  <string id="6095231">I guess they're not going to give anything back now, huh?</string>
  <string id="6095234">So much for them being reasonable. Let's find the stash and go.</string>
  <string id="6095237">Well that was unhealthy. Shall we find our smuggled goods now?</string>
  <string id="6095240">Anso's goods are probably in that chest.</string>
  <string id="6095244">It's empty.</string>
  <string id="6095247">Waste of bloody time! Who put us up to this?</string>
  <string id="6095248">Aww. An empty chest is like an empty bed. What a waste.</string>
  <string id="6095249">Well, so much for that.</string>
  <string id="6095250">So what now?</string>
  <string id="6095251">Whatever that dwarf wanted is long gone.</string>
  <string id="6095254">I don't think anyone came out unscathed. What now?</string>
  <string id="6095257">Nobody came out of that looking good. What now?</string>
  <string id="6095260">I doubt any side was satisfied. And now?</string>
  <string id="6095263">A mess for everyone. What now?</string>
  <string id="6095266">About that... Hawke, there's something I need to tell you. At your house. Very, very soon.</string>
  <string id="6095272">Go to the Hanged Man at night to look for the guards who allowed the Qunari to be taken.</string>
  <string id="6095294">Why do you even care?</string>
  <string id="6095297">Is there a reason you're interested?</string>
  <string id="6095300">Now we're family?</string>
  <string id="6095316">Remember the time you ran off with the relic?</string>
  <string id="6095317">Quite easily.</string>
  <string id="6095327">Castillon deserved what he got, didn't he?</string>
  <string id="6095330">I really hate it when you're right.</string>
  <string id="6095333">You know I'm right.</string>
  <string id="6095334">Stop whining.</string>
  <string id="6095335">Sighs You are.</string>
  <string id="6095339">That's not what I meant!</string>
  <string id="6095344">You're not filling me with confidence, Isabela.</string>
  <string id="6095345">There's always something to look forward to.</string>
  <string id="6095346">Do I even want to know, Isabela? No, don't answer.</string>
  <string id="6095347">Why do you even care?</string>
  <string id="6095350">Is there a reason why you're interested?</string>
  <string id="6095353">Now you want to start asking questions?</string>
  <string id="6095364">Hawke. I have something to tell you. At your house. Very, very soon.</string>
  <string id="6095367">She's close. Fastest thing on the ocean, or so I've been told.</string>
  <string id="6095370">It was my decision.</string>
  <string id="6095375">The Arishok is the one to worry about. We wait for his reaction.</string>
  <string id="6095376">Not our move. We wait to see what the Arishok does.</string>
  <string id="6095380">The rest isn't up to us. Not yet. We get back to business and wait to see what the Arishok does.</string>
  <string id="6095382">The Arishok's the one to worry about. So we clean up and wait for trouble to find us.</string>
  <string id="6095386">Back to business while the Arishok decides how to respond, I guess.</string>
  <string id="6095387">Well, that was a mess. Better get things in order before the Arishok responds.</string>
  <string id="6095388">Better than three greased-up sailors.</string>
  <string id="6095391">Can't be good. The viscount's son, Qunari in the chantry. Bet it's going to rain, too.</string>
  <string id="6095394">When was the last time I ate? Who's cooking tonight? Sandal? Maker. Enchantment soup again.</string>
  <string id="6095397">Thumb right in the bowl last time. His enchanting hand, too. Yeah, I saw you, you squirrelly little knot-head.</string>
  <string id="6095400">Did I lock my chambers? I bet he's in there now. Ugh.</string>
  <string id="6095403">That guy looking at me? A lot of illness in this city. What's he looking at? Loony.</string>
  <string id="6095406">Yeah, that's it, keep walking. Can't trust anyone. Could be lyrium addled, Fade-crazed.</string>
  <string id="6095407">Hard enough doing this without soaking my hides. Thirty pounds of water and it's a march with no rations.</string>
  <string id="6095412">Dear Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
Here is your share of the Bone Pit payment. Please spend it at my store.&#13;
&#13;
Love,&#13;
Hubert</string>
  <string id="6095413">To my new partner,&#13;
&#13;
I'm pleased that you joined the Bone Pit Mining Venture! Unfortunately, in light of the recent dragon infestation, the mine is not quite profitable at the moment. In the near future, you may expect to receive significant profits in exchange for your active participation in our business.&#13;
&#13;
As our verbal agreement was not quite binding by Kirkwall law, I'm sending you this small sum as your first investment dividend. You realize that by accepting this, you are now legally bound to the Bone Pit Mining Venture.&#13;
&#13;
Sincerely,&#13;
Hubert</string>
  <string id="6095414">Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
Convincing the miners to return has allowed the Bone Pit Mining Venture to resume operation much sooner than if I'd had to hire all new workers.&#13;
&#13;
As our business has returned to marginal profitability, I've enclosed your next dividend! I do hope you'll spend this sum wisely and not waste it on that ill-advised expedition to the Deep Roads I've been hearing about. &#13;
&#13;
There is plenty of profit to be made in Kirkwall without having to risk life and limb! Should you happen to become blighted in the Deep Roads, I'm afraid that will void our partnership agreement.&#13;
&#13;
Sincerely,&#13;
Hubert</string>
  <string id="6095415">Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
Your next dividend from the Bone Pit Mining Venture, which I've enclosed, is smaller than I had hoped.&#13;
&#13;
Soon after the mine began to turn a profit, those Coterie jackals moved in to claim what is rightfully ours. They've warned me not to refuse their generous offer of protection. I had little choice but to submit to their extortion.&#13;
&#13;
Someday I hope the Coterie will get their due. But for now, they are simply too powerful to refuse.&#13;
&#13;
Hubert</string>
  <string id="6095416">Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
I've enclosed your latest dividend. It is smaller than usual due to attacks on our shipments over the last year.&#13;
&#13;
Since you've been so busy lately, I've had to take leave of my shop in Hightown in order to track down who is responsible for these thefts. Our Coterie protection has been useless, and I won't be surprised if they're involved.&#13;
&#13;
Hubert</string>
  <string id="6095417">Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
Here's your latest dividend. I believe you'll find it quite satisfactory.&#13;
&#13;
Profits have been soaring since you ended the bastard who was ambushing our shipments. The Coterie was actually apologetic for once! Thanks to one of their own being responsible for the thefts, they've agreed to waive their fee for the next two years.&#13;
&#13;
Now if only we could get the workers to stop winging about the harsh conditions. They actually expect me to hire guards for them. Well… that's what I have you for, partner!&#13;
&#13;
At your earliest convenience, please visit the Bone Pit to see whatever the miners are concerned with now. That Jansen fellow seems to be the loudest source of discontent.&#13;
&#13;
Hubert</string>
  <string id="6095418">Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
Here is your next dividend. As you can see, profits are increasing!&#13;
&#13;
Unfortunately, grievances are also increasing. Resolving their last dilemma has made our workers feel entitled! Honestly, I don't see why they couldn't have squashed the spiders themselves. They do have pickaxes!&#13;
&#13;
In any case, please make another trip to the Bone Pit when you get a chance.&#13;
&#13;
Hubert</string>
  <string id="6095419">Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
I imagine that was nasty business with those undead. You've earned this dividend, partner. I can't imagine how the mines became infested. &#13;
&#13;
The flapping tongues of our workers carried the news into town, and several Kirkwallers have begun chiding me about the Bone Pit being cursed and other such nonsense. And now some city official has threatened a citation if I don't hire guards for the mines within the next year.&#13;
&#13;
To top it all off, those miners are whining more boldly than ever! Now they expect brand new equipment. Perhaps you can set them straight the next time you visit the Bone Pit.&#13;
&#13;
Hubert</string>
  <string id="6095420">Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
This dividend is small, due to your limited involvement in the development of the Bone Pit Mining Venture. I've had to handle most business matters that I depend on you for myself. It leads me to rethinking our partnership arrangement.&#13;
&#13;
In the future, I hope you will take your business responsibilities more seriously.&#13;
&#13;
Hubert</string>
  <string id="6095421">Champion,&#13;
&#13;
Here's your latest dividend. It's a bit reduced this time. I had to pay the annual bonuses to the guards we hired last year. I suppose they are earning their pay, since their presence greatly decreases the complaints I receive, not to mention incidents of monsters mangling our miners.&#13;
&#13;
This may seems sudden, but I'm thinking of retiring from the mining business. These past several years have been very profitable, but I feel a need to refocus on buying and selling high-end fine goods. &#13;
&#13;
I'd like you to consider buying out my share of the Bone Pit Mining Venture. Think on it, and we'll speak when I return from my business outside of Kirkwall.&#13;
&#13;
Hubert</string>
  <string id="6095422">Pants</string>
  <string id="6095427">Still, got to have some control. What kind of damage sends these daft freaks out in the streets, talking to them... selves?</string>
  <string id="6095430">Ahem.</string>
  <string id="6095431">Guard-Captain, would you like to have a word with your man?</string>
  <string id="6095432">Aveline?</string>
  <string id="6095433">Guard-Captain?</string>
  <string id="6095442">Who?</string>
  <string id="6095445">Explosive Barrel</string>
  <string id="6095455">What?</string>
  <string id="6095458">Who!</string>
  <string id="6095461">Who what? I don't...</string>
  <string id="6095464">Who bought you! Who bought the honor of a proud guard of Kirkwall and made him a drunken mabari bitch!</string>
  <string id="6095467">I don't... I don't know.</string>
  <string id="6095473">He was a templar! I swear! He... he had the seal of the grand cleric and everything!</string>
  <string id="6095476">It's true!</string>
  <string id="6095479">The penalty for abandoning your post is ten days on the wall. I expect you to report in the morning.</string>
  <string id="6095482">Whimpers</string>
  <string id="6095485">There's your answer. A templar.</string>
  <string id="6095488">With the grand cleric's seal, no less. Well done.</string>
  <string id="6095493">You decided to join the mages after all. Will it sully your victory to have me here?</string>
  <string id="6095495">If we win, it will be more your victory than mine.</string>
  <string id="6095496">Please, join me.</string>
  <string id="6095497">If you want to help mages, begone from here. They cannot win with a murderer at their head.</string>
  <string id="6095498">Go away.</string>
  <string id="6095499">It will be a victory for us all.</string>
  <string id="6095500">I wish you victory.</string>
  <string id="6095510">It doesn't have to end that way.</string>
  <string id="6095513">You're not part of the Circle. You don't need to defend them.</string>
  <string id="6095516">I'd rather you were at my side. It's not too late.</string>
  <string id="6095519">I'm not forcing you to do anything.</string>
  <string id="6095522">You don't have to do this, Aveline. You know it's wrong.</string>
  <string id="6095525">If you switch sides, we could pretend we put a spell on you.</string>
  <string id="6095528">Er, I, ah, hope there will be no call to kill anyone, serah.</string>
  <string id="6095531">Maker forbid! I don't know what happened. He just stopped writing me.</string>
  <string id="6095547">I really should haul anchor first thing tomorrow morning but... I don't know.</string>
  <string id="6095550">I've taken a shine to Kirkwall and some of the people in it. I might stick around.</string>
  <string id="6095553">I don't know who you are, friend, but you've made a serious mistake coming here.</string>
  <string id="6095556">Lieutenant! I want everyone in the clearing! Now!</string>
  <string id="6095559">Captain...</string>
  <string id="6095562">Chokes</string>
  <string id="6095568">Your men are dead.</string>
  <string id="6095571">And your trap has failed. I suggest running back to your master while you can.</string>
  <string id="6095574">You're going nowhere, slave!</string>
  <string id="6095577">Grunts</string>
  <string id="6095580">I am not a slave.</string>
  <string id="6095584">Anders</string>
  <string id="6095588">My son.</string>
  <string id="6095591">He could not be protected. Even here, in the heart of the chantry.</string>
  <string id="6095594">Murdered in the heart of the chantry, by those who held a sacred trust.</string>
  <string id="6095597">What hope for this city, when we fail our own so completely?</string>
  <string id="6095598">This is not over, Excellency. The city needs a leader.</string>
  <string id="6095599">The city needs you strong.</string>
  <string id="6095600">It does. And I am no longer that person.</string>
  <string id="6095603">The Arishok is still here, Excellency. You must be ready to stand up to him.</string>
  <string id="6095604">The Qunari threat remains.</string>
  <string id="6095605">I cannot. I have already failed where it mattered most.</string>
  <string id="6095608">Please, Hawke. Leave me.</string>
  <string id="6095612">At least it can't get worse. Today, anyway. It's pretty late.</string>
  <string id="6095613">Look on the bright side?</string>
  <string id="6095614">You'll pardon me if I don't see the humor in the death of my son.</string>
  <string id="6095618">Wilmod and Keran were the most recent.</string>
  <string id="6095621">Shop Girl</string>
  <string id="6095625">Refugee</string>
  <string id="6095627">Refugee</string>
  <string id="6095631">You trying to get rid of me? That's not going to happen.</string>
  <string id="6095634">I've got a feeling something big's about to happen. Knowing you, you'll be right in the middle of it.</string>
  <string id="6095637">I wouldn't miss that for the world.</string>
  <string id="6095640">Come on.</string>
  <string id="6095651">I'll be discreet.</string>
  <string id="6095654">Suit yourself.</string>
  <string id="6095657">Where's the idol?</string>
  <string id="6095658">I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation. I just can't think of it right now.</string>
  <string id="6095659">Let's not be hasty.</string>
  <string id="6095660">Her intent is obvious, and what the Qun demands is clear.</string>
  <string id="6095661">Angry Refugee</string>
  <string id="6095666">Refugee</string>
  <string id="6095674">This is the last insult I intend to suffer. Resolve this, or her hiding place will be reduced to rubble.</string>
  <string id="6095677">I will be watching, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6095678">Lowtown (Night)</string>
  <string id="6095679">They are meeting with a templar. A last, pathetic mediation, no doubt.</string>
  <string id="6095685">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6095692">What demon do you serve?</string>
  <string id="6095700">Maker, no! It's starting again!</string>
  <string id="6095703">Screams</string>
  <string id="6095706">Uh oh...</string>
  <string id="6095713">I had a friend like you once. Got in all kinds of trouble, dragged me along. Didn't think I'd be doing that again.</string>
  <string id="6095731">Do you hear that? It's getting louder.</string>
  <string id="6095732">What just happened? Oh, that's not good...</string>
  <string id="6095733">Damnation! What's happening?</string>
  <string id="6095734">I...  uh, I think it's time for some jaunty drinking songs, don't you?</string>
  <string id="6095735">If someone was trying to scare me, it worked.</string>
  <string id="6095737">A set up for a trap.</string>
  <string id="6095742">This isn't being caused by some random artifact. The idol is still in the house, Hawke! It has to be.</string>
  <string id="6095743">What is going on here? There's no way the Veil could be torn this badly.</string>
  <string id="6095744">Blessed Andraste!</string>
  <string id="6095745">Shrieks Er... sorry.</string>
  <string id="6095746">Setheneran... what happened here? It wasn't like this before, was it?</string>
  <string id="6095748">Powerful magic, or many thousands of deaths, must have happened here.</string>
  <string id="6095752">What was that?</string>
  <string id="6095753">Varric, is that what you've been hearing?</string>
  <string id="6095754">Tell me you heard that, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6095755">I really should've gone to the privy before coming in here.</string>
  <string id="6095756">Oh dear...</string>
  <string id="6095758">Something in this house is restless.</string>
  <string id="6095762">Holy shit!</string>
  <string id="6095763">Andraste's flaming knickers!</string>
  <string id="6095764">In about ten seconds, I'm just going to smash everything in sight.</string>
  <string id="6095765">I'm starting to really hate this place, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6095766">Hello? Messere ghost? Would you stop that, please?</string>
  <string id="6095768">Whatever is here is angry.</string>
  <string id="6095772">Very funny.</string>
  <string id="6095773">I like this less and less by the minute.</string>
  <string id="6095774">Let's hurry this up so we can get out of here.</string>
  <string id="6095775">We get it already! House haunted. You can stop now!</string>
  <string id="6095776">Hawke? Varric? I would very much like to leave soon.</string>
  <string id="6095778">Not good.</string>
  <string id="6095782">I guess the buyer wasn't kidding.</string>
  <string id="6095783">Oh, that can't be a good sign.</string>
  <string id="6095784">I don't like this.</string>
  <string id="6095785">That would be quite the trick at parties.</string>
  <string id="6095786">It's not supposed to do that, is it?</string>
  <string id="6095788">Magic is at work here.</string>
  <string id="6095794">I have made this place a sanctum of healing and salvation. Why do you threaten it?</string>
  <string id="6095795">I'm just here to talk.</string>
  <string id="6095796">I mean no harm.</string>
  <string id="6095797">We're interested in getting into the Deep Roads. Rumor has it you were a Warden. Do you know a way?</string>
  <string id="6095800">Of what?</string>
  <string id="6095803">The Deep Roads.</string>
  <string id="6095806">Strange occupation for a Warden. Aren't you more about taint and death, not healing and salvation?</string>
  <string id="6095807">Are you the Grey Warden?</string>
  <string id="6095808">I want to know about the Deep Roads.</string>
  <string id="6095809">I'm just here for information.</string>
  <string id="6095810">The Deep Roads? Then you don't seek my services?</string>
  <string id="6095813">Did the Wardens send you to bring me back?</string>
  <string id="6095816">I'm not going. Those bastards made me get rid of my cat.</string>
  <string id="6095817">I've always heard that joining the Wardens is for life.</string>
  <string id="6095818">Can people leave the Wardens?</string>
  <string id="6095819">That's only partly true.</string>
  <string id="6095822">The hopelessly tainted by the darkspawn and plagued by nightmares about the Archdemon parts don't go away.</string>
  <string id="6095825">But it turns out if you hide well, you don't have to wear the uniform or go to the parties.</string>
  <string id="6095826">So you came to Kirkwall just to escape the Wardens?</string>
  <string id="6095827">What are you doing here?</string>
  <string id="6095828">You say that like it's a small thing.</string>
  <string id="6095831">Yes, I'm here because there's no Warden outpost, no darkspawn, and a whole host of refugees to blend in with.</string>
  <string id="6095834">And some reasons of my own.</string>
  <string id="6095835">I'm part of an expedition into the Deep Roads. Any information you have could save people's lives.</string>
  <string id="6095836">I want your help.</string>
  <string id="6095837">I will die a happy man if I never think about the blighted Deep Roads again.</string>
  <string id="6095840">I'm part of an expedition to the Deep Roads, and I'll pay to find an entrance.</string>
  <string id="6095841">Let me buy your information.</string>
  <string id="6095842">Hrmph. If I wanted money, I've been going about it all wrong.</string>
  <string id="6095845">I need to know how to get into the Deep Roads. You can tell me willingly or not.</string>
  <string id="6095846">Tell me or else.</string>
  <string id="6095847">Don't threaten me, little girl.</string>
  <string id="6095850">Don't threaten me, boy.</string>
  <string id="6095853">You can't imagine what I've come through to get here. I'm not interested...</string>
  <string id="6095856">Although... a favor for a favor. Does that sound like a fair deal? You help me, I'll help you?</string>
  <string id="6095857">Help my expedition reach the Deep Roads, and I'll do whatever you need.</string>
  <string id="6095858">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6095859">You don't ask for my terms? What if I were asking for the knight-commander's head on a spike?</string>
  <string id="6095862">Is that what you ask?</string>
  <string id="6095865">You decide.</string>
  <string id="6095868">Let's be more specific. I don't do anything involving children or animals.</string>
  <string id="6095869">What's the favor?</string>
  <string id="6095870">We'll get to the Deep Roads ourselves.</string>
  <string id="6095871">Forget it.</string>
  <string id="6095872">I have a Warden map of the depths in this area. But there's a price.</string>
  <string id="6095875">I came to Kirkwall to aid a friend. A mage. A prisoner in the wretched Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6095878">The templars learned of my plans to free him. Help me bring him safely past them, and you shall have your maps.</string>
  <string id="6095879">Tell me about your friend.</string>
  <string id="6095880">Who is this mage?</string>
  <string id="6095881">His name is Karl Thekla. He was sent here from Ferelden when Kirkwall's Circle required new talent.</string>
  <string id="6095884">His last letter said the knight-commander was turning the Circle into a prison.</string>
  <string id="6095887">Mages are locked in their cells, refused appearances at court, made Tranquil for the slightest crimes. I told him I would come.</string>
  <string id="6095888">You want to make your friend an apostate?</string>
  <string id="6095889">Help him escape the Circle?</string>
  <string id="6095890">That's such a weighted term.</string>
  <string id="6095893">Yes, Andraste said magic should serve man, not rule him. But I've yet to find a mage who wants to rule anything.</string>
  <string id="6095896">It goes against no will of the Maker for mages to live as free as other men.</string>
  <string id="6095897">What do the templars know of your plans?</string>
  <string id="6095898">How did the templars find out?</string>
  <string id="6095899">I don't know. I had been exchanging notes with Karl through a maidservant in the Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6095902">Then the letters stopped coming.</string>
  <string id="6095903">How do you plan to break him out of the Gallows?</string>
  <string id="6095904">What is your plan?</string>
  <string id="6095905">I'm hoping it won't come to that.</string>
  <string id="6095908">I sent Karl a message to meet me in the chantry tonight. Maker willing, he'll be there, alone.</string>
  <string id="6095911">But if there are templars with him, I swear, I'll free him from them. Whatever the cost.</string>
  <string id="6095912">I would help any mage in such circumstances, map or no.</string>
  <string id="6095913">I help all my fellow mages.</string>
  <string id="6095914">Now you're just trying to get on my good side.</string>
  <string id="6095917">I welcome your aid. I have already sent word for Karl to meet me in the chantry tonight.</string>
  <string id="6095920">Join us there, and we'll ensure that no matter who is with him, we all walk away free.</string>
  <string id="6095921">You've convinced me. What's your plan?</string>
  <string id="6095922">I will help.</string>
  <string id="6095923">Oh, that's all? I might just take my chances with the darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6095924">You want me to fight templars?</string>
  <string id="6095925">If we fight the templars, it is because they decide that anyone who befriends a mage deserves death without questioning.</string>
  <string id="6095928">I will not make this deal sight-unseen.</string>
  <string id="6095929">Show me the maps.</string>
  <string id="6095930">It's all right here. But you don't see one page until Karl is free.</string>
  <string id="6095933">These are my terms. If you want my aid with your expedition, meet me in the chantry tonight.</string>
  <string id="6095936">I have sent word to Karl to be there. Maker willing, we will all leave free men.</string>
  <string id="6095942">That wasn't normal magic you just did, was it? </string>
  <string id="6095945">So, let me guess. This is the part where you tell me you're an abomination?</string>
  <string id="6095948">You're wrong. But not far wrong.</string>
  <string id="6095951">Talk. What happened to you in the chantry?</string>
  <string id="6095954">I... this is hard to explain. When I was in Amaranthine, I met a spirit of Justice who was trapped outside the Fade.</string>
  <string id="6095957">We became friends. And he recognized the injustice that mages in Thedas face every day.</string>
  <string id="6095958">And that's... different than a demon?</string>
  <string id="6095959">A spirit of justice?</string>
  <string id="6095960">Just as demons prey on the deadly sins of mankind, there are good spirits who embody our virtues.</string>
  <string id="6095963">Spirits of compassion, fortitude... justice.</string>
  <string id="6095966">They are the Maker's first children, and they have all but given up on us.</string>
  <string id="6095967">This spirit sounds like a useful friend to have.</string>
  <string id="6095968">You are fortunate.</string>
  <string id="6095969">He was far better to me than I have been to him.</string>
  <string id="6095972">So, I wasn't so far off with that abomination thing?</string>
  <string id="6095973">And now your eyes glow...</string>
  <string id="6095974">What does this have to do with your eyes glowing?</string>
  <string id="6095975">Are you saying what I think?</string>
  <string id="6095976">Just say whatever you have to say.</string>
  <string id="6095977">Spit it out.</string>
  <string id="6095978">To live outside the Fade, he needed a host. I offered to help him...</string>
  <string id="6095981">We were going to work together, bring justice to every child ever ripped away from his mother to be sent to the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6095984">But... I guess I had too much anger. Once he was inside me, he... changed.</string>
  <string id="6095985">So, you have this spirit of justice living in your head?</string>
  <string id="6095986">Let me get this straight...</string>
  <string id="6095987">It's not like that. He's gone now. He's part of me.</string>
  <string id="6095990">It's not like we can... have a conversation. I feel his thoughts as my own.</string>
  <string id="6095993">Not even the greatest scholar could tell you where I end and he begins.</string>
  <string id="6095994">This is obviously difficult for you.</string>
  <string id="6095995">I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6095996">I thought I was helping my friend. He would have... died, I guess. If that even means anything.</string>
  <string id="6095999">And he wanted to help me. He knew what mages have suffered.</string>
  <string id="6096002">That really didn't look like a happy, benevolent spirit from where I was standing. </string>
  <string id="6096003">He didn't look too friendly.</string>
  <string id="6096004">Since when is justice happy? Justice is righteous. Justice is hard.</string>
  <string id="6096007">So he's a demon now?</string>
  <string id="6096008">Changed to what?</string>
  <string id="6096009">No! He is a spirit whose only purpose is to see the innocent saved and the guilty punished.</string>
  <string id="6096012">But my anger... when I see templars now, things that have always outraged me, but I could never do anything about...</string>
  <string id="6096015">He comes out. And he is no longer my friend Justice. He is a force of vengeance. And he has no grasp of mercy.</string>
  <string id="6096016">Can Justice ever be separated from you?</string>
  <string id="6096017">Can you undo this?</string>
  <string id="6096018">I don't think so. The only way a spirit has ever been separated from a living host is by its death.</string>
  <string id="6096021">The curse is of my own making. All I can do now is hope to control it.</string>
  <string id="6096022">Can you bring him out at will?</string>
  <string id="6096023">Can you control it?</string>
  <string id="6096024">No. He comes only when I've lost all power over myself.</string>
  <string id="6096027">It's a madness, a frenzy. I only find out after what I might have done.</string>
  <string id="6096028">Is there anything I can do for you?</string>
  <string id="6096029">I wish I could help.</string>
  <string id="6096030">You're the first one I've ever told this. Thank you for not running away.</string>
  <string id="6096033">So, that explains your whole sexy tortured look.</string>
  <string id="6096034">I like men with dark pasts.</string>
  <string id="6096035">Perhaps I should check a looking glass more often.</string>
  <string id="6096038">I've rarely met a man who says such things so openly. But you're obviously a rare man.</string>
  <string id="6096041">I had not thought to ever find a woman who would look past what I just said.</string>
  <string id="6096044">I thought I was done with the Grey Wardens, but if you have any need of me... I will be waiting here.</string>
  <string id="6096048">I just need your Grey Warden expertise, not a diatribe on your strange personal habits.</string>
  <string id="6096049">I need that Deep Roads map.</string>
  <string id="6096050">Here. These are all the documents I have for this area.</string>
  <string id="6096053">I can understand if you would rather me not join you personally.</string>
  <string id="6096056">I cannot control my need for vengeance. I would ask no one to take on the danger of traveling with me.</string>
  <string id="6096062">Mages are humans... and elves... just like the rest of us.</string>
  <string id="6096063">You're wrong.</string>
  <string id="6096064">Many might go their whole lives thinking that.</string>
  <string id="6096067">But if even one in ten falls to the lure of blood magic, they could destroy this world.</string>
  <string id="6096070">But I will not preach. Thank you for your service. I will relieve Keran of his commission now, pending investigation.</string>
  <string id="6096076">You take a grave risk in trusting me.</string>
  <string id="6096137">Do you hear that? I think it's music.</string>
  <string id="6096165">And get every last hour of work out of us before we were eaten!</string>
  <string id="6096168">You men will have a safe environment and steady pay from now on.</string>
  <string id="6096171">Up-jumped bloody dog-lord.</string>
  <string id="6096176">I apologize.</string>
  <string id="6096179">When I asked Anso to provide a distraction for the hunters, I had no idea they'd be so... numerous.</string>
  <string id="6096180">You were responsible for this?</string>
  <string id="6096181">A distraction?</string>
  <string id="6096191">I'm the reason you're here, yes.</string>
  <string id="6096194">I take it these men were looking for you.</string>
  <string id="6096195">They were after you?</string>
  <string id="6096196">Correct.</string>
  <string id="6096200">We had no trouble.</string>
  <string id="6096201">We've faced worse.</string>
  <string id="6096204">It appears we're unscathed.</string>
  <string id="6096207">Don't worry. We do this sort of thing often.</string>
  <string id="6096210">Impressive.</string>
  <string id="6096213">My name is Fenris. These men were Imperial bounty hunters seeking to recover a magister's lost property, namely myself.</string>
  <string id="6096216">They were trying to lure me into the open. Crude as their methods were, I could not face them alone.</string>
  <string id="6096219">Thankfully, Anso chose wisely.</string>
  <string id="6096220">Everything Anso said was a lie, then?</string>
  <string id="6096221">So there's no job?</string>
  <string id="6096222">That seems like a lot of effort to find one slave.</string>
  <string id="6096223">You're an escaped slave?</string>
  <string id="6096224">If you couldn't fight them, why not just run?</string>
  <string id="6096225">Why face them at all?</string>
  <string id="6096226">I don't appreciate being lied to.</string>
  <string id="6096227">You used me.</string>
  <string id="6096228">If they were really trying to recapture you, then I'm happy I helped.</string>
  <string id="6096229">Slavers deserve their fate.</string>
  <string id="6096230">Anso's job did seem a little too easy.</string>
  <string id="6096231">Now it all makes sense.</string>
  <string id="6096248">Where is that singing coming from? You hear it, right, Hawke?</string>
  <string id="6096253">Loose Ends</string>
  <string id="6096254">Loose Ends</string>
  <string id="6096257">No.</string>
  <string id="6096260">Good. Then I'm not going crazy.</string>
  <string id="6096263">I did.</string>
  <string id="6096266">You know, that didn't make me feel better.</string>
  <string id="6096275">Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
I take back everything I said about your blighted family. You were right, you were the best we ever had. If you're looking for honest work and good coin, come see me in Lowtown. I can keep you busy for a while.&#13;
&#13;
Meeran</string>
  <string id="6096280">We have the delegate, and... so many others... but I can't return them to the Qunari like this.</string>
  <string id="6096300">Oh good, we're under attack.</string>
  <string id="6096301">Finally, something I can handle.</string>
  <string id="6096302">Watch out!</string>
  <string id="6096303">Hawke? Varric? I think this is bad...</string>
  <string id="6096305">Watch yourself.</string>
  <string id="6096307">Someone tell me where that damnable singing is coming from!</string>
  <string id="6096311">What was that?</string>
  <string id="6096312">Uh oh.</string>
  <string id="6096313">Whatever that was, I dislike it on principle.</string>
  <string id="6096314">Oh dear...</string>
  <string id="6096316">The disturbances are growing stronger.</string>
  <string id="6096318">We're getting closer. I can feel it, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6096319">You've been gone a while. I thought you had things under control.</string>
  <string id="6096323">They're dead.</string>
  <string id="6096324">I killed them.</string>
  <string id="6096326">I'm not making a habit of finding wayward Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6096327">I don't know.</string>
  <string id="6096331">If you've nothing relevant to add, I'll get to it.</string>
  <string id="6096332">Enough. I'll deal with it.</string>
  <string id="6096335">Go, Hawke. We will speak again. Eventually, the Qun will demand it.</string>
  <string id="6096338">Disappointing.</string>
  <string id="6096339">As I expected.</string>
  <string id="6096346">So be it.</string>
  <string id="6096347">You are learning.</string>
  <string id="6096350">Kirkwall can simmer in filth for yet another day. I accept the outcome of this... isolated incident.</string>
  <string id="6096358">Hawke...</string>
  <string id="6096361">Your inevitable death holds great promise. I look forward to it, as should you.</string>
  <string id="6096370">Go, human. Fear me somewhere else.</string>
  <string id="6096375">Templar Hugh</string>
  <string id="6096379">Templar Paxley</string>
  <string id="6096383">Templar Ruvena</string>
  <string id="6096400">You once admitted killing my Qunari, but you recoiled from the zealots of this city. You will understand why I must do this.</string>
  <string id="6096405">Speak to Meeran in Lowtown after dark.</string>
  <string id="6096406">Kill the guards.</string>
  <string id="6096407">Not everything. Your employer was simply not who you believed.</string>
  <string id="6096408">It is.</string>
  <string id="6096409">There comes a time when you must stop running, when you turn and face the tiger.</string>
  <string id="6096416">I have met few in my travels who have sought anything more than personal gain.</string>
  <string id="6096419">Perhaps the deception was unnecessary. If so, I am sorry. I have become too accustomed to hiding.</string>
  <string id="6096422">If I may ask: What was in the chest? The one they kept in the house?</string>
  <string id="6096425">It was empty.</string>
  <string id="6096431">I suppose it was too much to hope for. Even so, I had to know.</string>
  <string id="6096432">All that for an empty chest?</string>
  <string id="6096433">Is that it?</string>
  <string id="6096436">You have not hidden the abuses of your zealots, or the corruption of this city. You will understand why I must do this.</string>
  <string id="6096452">I got a bit weighty the last time we talked. Sorry for putting that on you.</string>
  <string id="6096453">You can tell me anything.</string>
  <string id="6096454">I'm always ready to listen.</string>
  <string id="6096455">Anything? Be careful what you offer.</string>
  <string id="6096458">You'd be surprised how people just tell me their darkest secrets. I must look trustworthy.</string>
  <string id="6096459">It happens a lot.</string>
  <string id="6096460">You look... something. True. Proud. Like even if you don't agree with me, you'll be honest.</string>
  <string id="6096463">I just... I hope I didn't seem too selfish when I told you about Justice.</string>
  <string id="6096466">I didn't know what would happen. I figured a willing host, a friend... it had to be better than playing the demon and haunting some corpse.</string>
  <string id="6096467">We can't always predict the outcome of our actions. We can only make them with a true heart.</string>
  <string id="6096468">You did the right thing.</string>
  <string id="6096469">Kind, wise and beautiful. You must have made a deal with some demons, yourself.</string>
  <string id="6096472">I'm sorry. I shouldn't presume. I just... we've hardly met and I feel like I know you.</string>
  <string id="6096473">Doesn't mean I want you to stop...</string>
  <string id="6096474">It's... unexpected.</string>
  <string id="6096475">I'll keep that in mind.</string>
  <string id="6096478">Keep telling me I'm beautiful. You can't go wrong with that.</string>
  <string id="6096479">No.</string>
  <string id="6096480">Oh, I'm sure I can get more creative. </string>
  <string id="6096483">Well, he can't complain about his looks, anyway.</string>
  <string id="6096484">At least he got a nice body.</string>
  <string id="6096485">No. Don't go there. That's not going to end well. I don't want to hurt you.</string>
  <string id="6096488">Spirits aren't meant to inhabit human bodies. That's what demons do.</string>
  <string id="6096489">You should have known better.</string>
  <string id="6096490">The templars have everything! For a thousand years, they've had the knights, the lyrium, the bloody Maker on their side.</string>
  <string id="6096493">If you're born with magic, they hear about it. They search your little rat-spit village and find you.</string>
  <string id="6096496">And if you run away, they hunt you down. Again and again and again.</string>
  <string id="6096497">You're speaking from personal experience?</string>
  <string id="6096498">That's horrible.</string>
  <string id="6096499">Andraste's words were that magic must not rule over man.</string>
  <string id="6096502">But I shouldn't say that too loudly. I don't want you hurt just for knowing me.</string>
  <string id="6096503">For a thousand years, we've bowed to them. But some day that will change.</string>
  <string id="6096504">You're starting to glow again.</string>
  <string id="6096505">You're getting angry.</string>
  <string id="6096506">And since yours is the only head here and I don't want to rip it off, I should stop. Yes. Sorry.</string>
  <string id="6096512">Besides, we have so much to do before the Deep Roads.</string>
  <string id="6096515">Next time, I'll try to keep to more... pleasant... topics.</string>
  <string id="6096516">Mages are dangerous. Would you have the templars leave them to the demons?</string>
  <string id="6096517">The templars have reasons.</string>
  <string id="6096518">Magic is a tool, same as a bow or sword. Would you cut off a child's hands to ensure he never wields one in anger?</string>
  <string id="6096522">Keep your personal issues to yourself. Our relationship is strictly professional.</string>
  <string id="6096523">Don't do it again.</string>
  <string id="6096524">Understood.</string>
  <string id="6096527">Well. Under that scruffy exterior, I think you've got a bit of a soft heart, yourself.</string>
  <string id="6096532">Am I making you uncomfortable?</string>
  <string id="6096533">Am I making you uncomfortable?</string>
  <string id="6096534">No.</string>
  <string id="6096538">Jump to where?</string>
  <string id="6096539">The Hanged Man (Day)</string>
  <string id="6096540">The Hanged Man (Day)</string>

  <string id="6096552">Quest Start</string>
  <string id="6096553">Did the player agree to meet her at the duel location?</string>

  <string id="6096567">Quest accepted reluctantly. Jumping to Hightown (Night), for the ambush.</string>
  <string id="6096572">I called her here. I think the people deserve to know just what you've done.</string>
  <string id="6096575">Hayder Confrontation</string>
  <string id="6096576">Hayder Confrontation</string>
  <string id="6096578">Exit Debug</string>
  <string id="6096579">Exit Debug</string>
  <string id="6096584">Good.</string>
  <string id="6096600">No. I shouldn't do this. I don't want to hurt you.</string>
  <string id="6096604">Growing up in the Circle, everything is about order and rules and the templars. The apprentices... we found ways to make that bearable.</string>
  <string id="6096607">Karl and I... he was the first. We could forget that out in the world we were nothing but templar slaves.</string>
  <string id="6096610">We hadn't been together for a long time. But still... it hurt.</string>
  <string id="6096611">No one should have to go through that.</string>
  <string id="6096612">I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6096613">It's the bloody templars.</string>
  <string id="6096616">What if we just get back to the flirting part?</string>
  <string id="6096617">Let's talk about me.</string>
  <string id="6096618">I wish it were that easy. But I have this... voice inside me, this drive for justice... When I think about the templars, it's unbearable.</string>
  <string id="6096624">Oh! There's an image I didn't need.</string>
  <string id="6096625">Too much information!</string>
  <string id="6096626">They don't see us as people. They don't care that Karl was someone's son... someone's lover.</string>
  <string id="6096629">Why would you hurt me?</string>
  <string id="6096630">Hurt me?</string>
  <string id="6096631">Hurt me. I might like it.</string>
  <string id="6096632">I don't mind a little pain.</string>
  <string id="6096633">I'm a big girl. I can make my own decisions.</string>
  <string id="6096634">I can take care of myself.</string>
  <string id="6096635">No.</string>
  <string id="6096638">You saw what I did in the chantry. That's who I am.</string>
  <string id="6096641">A year ago, maybe we could have had something. But I'm not that man anymore. I'll break your heart.</string>
  <string id="6096644">They tell your parents they'll be thrown in prison if they ever ask about you, stripped of their rights in the eyes of the Maker.</string>
  <string id="6096647">It is not ruling to simply wish for the same rights as any man.</string>
  <string id="6096683">I knew it! I knew it would be here!</string>
  <string id="6096736">I thought I was done for.</string>
  <string id="6096738">I'm not sure about attacking templars. I might rather take my chances with the darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6096739">You want me to fight templars?</string>
  <string id="6096740">So, he's a nice spirit?</string>
  <string id="6096743">Those sodding darkspawn jumped me out of nowhere. Nearly took my arm off!</string>
  <string id="6096746">My apologies. You save my life, and I don't even introduce myself. I'm Iwan.</string>
  <string id="6096747">You're the man who abandoned his brothers to die at the hands of the darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6096748">I know who you are.</string>
  <string id="6096749">Bah! I didn't abandon them. Merin was already lost to the darkspawn. And leaving Emrys behind was safer for the both of us!</string>
  <string id="6096750">After what Emrys told me, I wasn't sure I'd find you in time.</string>
  <string id="6096751">Good to see you still live.</string>
  <string id="6096752">When I get saved from being eaten, the first thing I worry about is proper etiquette.</string>
  <string id="6096753">Yes, how disrespectful.</string>
  <string id="6096754">The training of a merchant's son, I guess. I take it you met my brother?</string>
  <string id="6096761">Sighs You were right. We shouldn't have let Castillon go. I should've known better. </string>
  <string id="6096764">I can't believe I'm even admitting this to you.</string>
  <string id="6096765">Admitting you were wrong is the first step to changing.</string>
  <string id="6096766">I'm glad you are.</string>
  <string id="6096767">Say another sappy thing like that, and I'm going to hit you.</string>
  <string id="6096770">You were right to be upset with me for letting Castillon go.</string>
  <string id="6096773">I'm so going to enjoy this.</string>
  <string id="6096774">I told you so!</string>
  <string id="6096775">Fine. It's deserved.</string>
  <string id="6096778">You're bad at apologizing.</string>
  <string id="6096779">Is that all you have to say?</string>
  <string id="6096780">I'm not apologizing! I'm... ugh! All right, I am apologizing. I'm sorry I let him go. I really am.</string>
  <string id="6096783">What's worse, you've been right all along. I am selfish.</string>
  <string id="6096789">I'm glad we got rid of Castillon. I... I'm proud that we did.</string>
  <string id="6096792">He had a nice ship, but it was just a ship. Knowing he's gone is... I can't describe it.</string>
  <string id="6096795">We've done something special for the people he wronged. I don't know if it's justice, but it certainly is satisfying.</string>
  <string id="6096796">You've grown over the years. I've seen it.</string>
  <string id="6096797">You've come a long way.</string>
  <string id="6096798">I have? Are you saying I'm getting fat? I am reaching that age, aren't I? Is it my ass?</string>
  <string id="6096801">Sighs</string>
  <string id="6096804">Chuckles</string>
  <string id="6096807">What have you done with Isabela?</string>
  <string id="6096808">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="6096809">Isabela just had an epiphany, is all.</string>
  <string id="6096812">Took you long enough to come to your senses.</string>
  <string id="6096813">Finally, she gets it.</string>
  <string id="6096814">I've done lousy things to people. I thought ignoring the consequences of my actions would make them go away.</string>
  <string id="6096820">I thought it made me free. I was wrong, wasn't I?</string>
  <string id="6096821">This is a huge step forward. I'm proud of you.</string>
  <string id="6096822">I'm glad you realize that.</string>
  <string id="6096823">Oh, stop it! This is your fault, you know.</string>
  <string id="6096826">If I made a list of the things you were wrong about, they'd stretch from here to Tevinter.</string>
  <string id="6096827">That and more.</string>
  <string id="6096828">I'm glad you have a sense of humor about it, at least.</string>
  <string id="6096831">You weren't free. You were just a coward.</string>
  <string id="6096832">Dead wrong.</string>
  <string id="6096833">I should be angry, but I'm not. I deserve that.</string>
  <string id="6096836">You've always assumed I'm a stronger person than I really am. Even now I don't know if I can be that person.</string>
  <string id="6096839">But... I'm willing to try. For you. You just have to be patient with me.</string>
  <string id="6096842">Sighs I must be losing my mind.</string>
  <string id="6096847">You... you're here. Good. I... wanted to talk to you.</string>
  <string id="6096850">I thought you didn't want to talk.</string>
  <string id="6096851">Wait a minute. I don't smell alcohol on your breath. Will wonders never cease?</string>
  <string id="6096854">Oh, shush! I... I've been thinking.</string>
  <string id="6096855">That was a while ago. I've... I've had time to think.</string>
  <string id="6096858">Something on your mind?</string>
  <string id="6096863">Emrys is still alive? Good. That's good.</string>
  <string id="6096866">I am... grateful for your timely arrival, but I'm sure Emrys needs your help more. The fool still believes Merin can be saved.</string>
  <string id="6096869">I'll only be a little longer, I'm sure. Then I can catch up and help you retrieve Merin's body.</string>
  <string id="6096870">You just lost your brother. Why are you out here instead of with Emrys?</string>
  <string id="6096871">You don't seem too upset.</string>
  <string id="6096872">Your love for your siblings is heartwarming.</string>
  <string id="6096873">What lucky brothers you have.</string>
  <string id="6096874">Emrys said you were after a weapon. I'm here to make sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.</string>
  <string id="6096875">Where's the sword?</string>
  <string id="6096879">It's a dwarven artifact! It should be in dwarven hands!</string>
  <string id="6096882">How incredibly noble of you. The ancestors would be proud.</string>
  <string id="6096891">There has to be other treasure here you can hock. Leave me to mine!</string>
  <string id="6096892">I can't just leave you alone. The darkspawn will be back in larger numbers.</string>
  <string id="6096893">You'll die down here.</string>
  <string id="6096894">You're only alive because I wanted information on the weapon. But if you won't help me...</string>
  <string id="6096895">I'm taking the sword.</string>
  <string id="6096896">I don't think you're in any position to make demands...</string>
  <string id="6096897">Are you telling me what to do?</string>
  <string id="6096898">You want the blighted sword, don't you? That's why you're here.</string>
  <string id="6096901">You know what? Fine. The weapon is yours if you can get to it. This isn't worth my life.</string>
  <string id="6096904">But it was worth your brother's life?</string>
  <string id="6096905">You sacrificed your family for wealth. Pathetic.</string>
  <string id="6096906">Coward.</string>
  <string id="6096908">You'd... kill me?</string>
  <string id="6096915">The man who told me about the sword sold me a control rod for a golem that protects it.</string>
  <string id="6096927">Varric will settle on a price with you.</string>
  <string id="6096928">Varric, negotiate.</string>
  <string id="6096929">I could just say you were dead when I found you.</string>
  <string id="6096930">I could kill you for it.</string>
  <string id="6096939">That stupid plate was the whole city of Orzammar to him.</string>
  <string id="6096942">You inherited the family businesses, didn't you? </string>
  <string id="6096943">Don't you deal with them now?</string>
  <string id="6096944">Everything makes you thirsty. Don't try to blame that on the Dwarven Merchant Guild, Varric.</string>
  <string id="6096945">You always need a drink.</string>
  <string id="6096950">So when do I get the grand tour?</string>
  <string id="6096953">Of the ship?</string>
  <string id="6096960">Haven't you already—oh, you mean my ship.</string>
  <string id="6097000">The Arishok is growing violent. He might want an excuse to end this peace.</string>
  <string id="6097001">Could this be a Qunari plot?</string>
  <string id="6097002">I suspect that if the Arishok wanted to take over, he simply would.</string>
  <string id="6097005">For all we fear that heretical Qun of his, its demands have done more to keep him in check than any of our efforts.</string>
  <string id="6097008">Besides, would Qunari stoop to trickery? There is no precedent, but there is unfortunate evidence of influence on our side.</string>
  <string id="6097009">I'm surprised you haven't sailed off into the night on your new ship.</string>
  <string id="6097012">Not this time. I like keeping you on your toes. What will she do next? Laughs</string>
  <string id="6097013">Ah, you're still here. At least some things are constant in this ever-changing world.</string>
  <string id="6097041">What took you so long? We must enter quickly, before anyone has a chance to escape.</string>
  <string id="6097042">I've done what you wanted. The job's over.</string>
  <string id="6097043">Do I get paid?</string>
  <string id="6097044">Not just yet.</string>
  <string id="6097047">You were expecting something else?</string>
  <string id="6097048">What did you think was in it?</string>
  <string id="6097049">I was, but I shouldn't have. It was bait, nothing more.</string>
  <string id="6097055">It's as I thought. My former master accompanied them to the city.</string>
  <string id="6097058">I know you have questions, but I must confront him before he flees. I will need your help.</string>
  <string id="6097060">Lead the way.</string>
  <string id="6097062">Forget it.</string>
  <string id="6097068">I already gave you my answer.</string>
  <string id="6097069">No.</string>
  <string id="6097072">May the wind speed your travels, my friend.</string>
  <string id="6097073">If I'm compensated for my trouble, then I'll help.</string>
  <string id="6097074">Make it worth my time.</string>
  <string id="6097075">I will find a way to repay you. I swear it.</string>

  <string id="6097110">Lirene's Fereldan Imports</string>
  <string id="6097116">The lot of Fereldans here has improved since your rise, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6097120">Feel free to browse my wares.</string>
  <string id="6097121">A Friend in the Guard</string>
  <string id="6097122">Aveline may have information about working with the city guard. Talk to her at the barracks in the Viscount's Keep.</string>
  <string id="6097126">City Guardsman</string>
  <string id="6097130">The profits help Fereldan refugees, here and at home.</string>
  <string id="6097133">I'd be honored to sell you anything in the store.</string>
  <string id="6097144">I will be here in my clinic if you need me.</string>
  <string id="6097150">I'm not sure. It looks like Bartrand was cooking the books, but that's not exactly a shock to anyone.</string>
  <string id="6097151">I did. And I drink a lot more now than I used to.</string>
  <string id="6097152">You might have a point there, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6097156">All right, all right! It's yours!</string>
  <string id="6097159">Well, it's better than nothing, I suppose.</string>
  <string id="6097167">What? If you call me your rock or your foundation, I'm going to hit you.</string>
  <string id="6097173">It's not fit to be seen. Castillon had an obsession with mustard-colored satin.</string>
  <string id="6097185">I'm calling this my suite because it sounds better than my slightly less filthy room in the Hanged Man. Come on in.</string>
  <string id="6097191">I never get tired of this place. Come on in, Hawke. Have a seat.</string>
  <string id="6097197">Here we are! Come on in, Hawke! I'll get a couple of pints, and we can talk.</string>
  <string id="6097200">No, I... I've come so far. There are more... so many more than I thought.</string>
  <string id="6097208">Brother.</string>
  <string id="6097211">You always seem to find a way to make my life difficult.</string>
  <string id="6097218">Just don't go catching the blight again, or whatever it is we mages carry.</string>
  <string id="6097221">I'm pretty much the walking dead already, thanks. You kind of accept that as a Warden.</string>
  <string id="6097224">I wish... I wish mother could have seen us like this. I don't know what she would think about the rest, but...</string>
  <string id="6097225">Can't change the past, Carver. That's for bards and liars.</string>
  <string id="6097226">Don't dwell on it.</string>
  <string id="6097227">Is there a difference?</string>
  <string id="6097228">She always knew it would take something like this to bring us together.</string>
  <string id="6097229">Mother knew we'd work it out.</string>
  <string id="6097230">I suppose she did.</string>
  <string id="6097231">Don't make me tear up in front of the others, you jackass.</string>
  <string id="6097232">No hugs on the battlefield.</string>
  <string id="6097233">Right, right. A lot of dust out here today.</string>
  <string id="6097239">Karl was a good mage, a good man. It goes against all Chantry law to make him Tranquil.</string>
  <string id="6097260">I'm proud to call you brother. That's gone unsaid too long.</string>
  <string id="6097263">I'm proud to call you sister. That's gone unsaid too long.</string>
  <string id="6097266">In war, victory, Champion. And whatever else may come.</string>
  <string id="6097267">Maker guide us, Champion. To his side, if need be.</string>
  <string id="6097270">Merin's dead. Nothing's going to change that. Besides, would I really honor my brother's sacrifice by not finishing what we started?</string>
  <string id="6097276">We were after a dwarven weapon, trying to make sure it stayed in dwarven hands!</string>
  <string id="6097285">Anyway, I'm glad you're here. Saves me the trouble of having to go look for you.</string>
  <string id="6097286">Don't you have a funeral to attend?</string>
  <string id="6097287">Moping about the loss of your ship?</string>
  <string id="6097290">I'm over that. Castillon deserved what he got.</string>
  <string id="6097293">Laughs I hope the cleansing blaze of the funeral pyres rejects his vile, sagging ass.</string>
  <string id="6097313">I should be hunting Archdemons but... it feels right to be at your side again.</string>
  <string id="6097314">I never thought that joining the templars would actually bring us side by side. It's... good.</string>
  <string id="6097315">I thought you and I were done, but nothing is absolute. Strange that I had to join the templars to learn that.</string>
  <string id="6097316">Don't go soft on me. We'll need some anger for the fight.</string>
  <string id="6097317">Make it count.</string>
  <string id="6097318">Don't worry about that. I have to make sure your mess doesn't get out of control.</string>
  <string id="6097321">Tension like this is hidden in a lot of places. We set an example here, we make a difference.</string>
  <string id="6097325">I'm glad you're here.</string>
  <string id="6097326">This is where you should be. The brothers Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6097329">That won't always be the case. You know that.</string>
  <string id="6097333">Be careful, all right?</string>
  <string id="6097339">On your order, Brother. We'll make a difference, whatever the outcome.</string>
  <string id="6097344">The world is a big place, but the faces are the same. We do right here, we make a difference.</string>
  <string id="6097355">I wanted to thank you for everything you've done for me. I'm glad you walked in here all those years ago.</string>
  <string id="6097356">You've been a good friend and a constant source of excitement.</string>
  <string id="6097357">I am as well.</string>
  <string id="6097358">I was drawn in by the intoxicating aroma of stale piss and vomit.</string>
  <string id="6097359">I couldn't help myself.</string>
  <string id="6097360">Ever since I met you, you've been nothing but trouble.</string>
  <string id="6097361">I can't say the same.</string>
  <string id="6097362">Better trouble than a bore, I say.</string>
  <string id="6097381">You'll get my best and then some.</string>
  <string id="6097384">This is where you should be. With family.</string>
  <string id="6097387">I've seen a lot of things. The world out there, it needs help. But I can start here.</string>
  <string id="6097390">Whatever we do here, this is the start of something big. But we can set a course.</string>
  <string id="6097393">Who'd have thought, huh? Two nobodies from Lothering.</string>
  <string id="6097399">Rubbed your collar with onions. Aveline's idea.</string>
  <string id="6097402">So, really, nothing to fear today except looking like an ass.</string>
  <string id="6097405">Take care of that for me, will you? I've put in my time.</string>
  <string id="6097406">Just don't be in a hurry to join the Maker, all right?</string>
  <string id="6097411">I'm a templar, not a cleric. I'd prefer to stay in this world as long as possible.</string>
  <string id="6097421">And if I can make it a better place, not just an ordered one, all the better.</string>
  <string id="6097424">And if I can make it an ordered place without looking like a zealot, all the better.</string>
  <string id="6097427">We'll save the Chant of Light for the tavern later. You'd be surprised how good it sounds as a drunken round song.</string>
  <string id="6097430">On your order, Sister. We'll make a difference, whatever the outcome.</string>
  <string id="6097437">I appreciate your help and support.</string>
  <string id="6097438">We have much to do.</string>
  <string id="6097468">Now that I have my ship, I'll need a new crew, and I'd like to have someone like you on board.</string>
  <string id="6097549">That's a little dramatic.</string>
  <string id="6097552">We could have prevented this if you hadn't stolen the damned book!</string>
  <string id="6097558">Maybe you would've been shipwrecked sooner. I'm a terrible sailor.</string>
  <string id="6097559">I wouldn't bet on it.</string>
  <string id="6097560">Are you? I suppose I'll have to keelhaul you till you shape up.</string>
  <string id="6097587">So, I hate thinking badly of family, but... did Uncle Gamlen seem a little slippery when he talked about Grandfather's will?</string>
  <string id="6097590">If he, say, invested money that was meant to be Mother's, do you think he would tell us?</string>
  <string id="6097591">I won't believe Mother's own brother would steal from her.</string>
  <string id="6097592">I'm sure he didn't do that.</string>
  <string id="6097593">Gamlen can't say good morning without lying twice.</string>
  <string id="6097594">Our uncle's a born liar.</string>
  <string id="6097595">I want what's ours.</string>
  <string id="6097596">We need to find that will.</string>
  <string id="6097603">Thinking about what might have been is pointless.</string>
  <string id="6097604">Don't dwell on the past.</string>
  <string id="6097605">You're right, of course. Forget the past, celebrate the present!</string>
  <string id="6097608">If you hadn't been shipwrecked, we wouldn't have met. That would've been a shame.</string>
  <string id="6097609">It all worked out.</string>
  <string id="6097613">Insist if you must, but Viscount Dumar will see no one! If you've news of Saemus, I will relay it to him.</string>
  <string id="6097616">Fine. Tell Dumar my scouts have tracked the boy and his Qunari captor to the Wounded Coast.</string>
  <string id="6097619">I'm taking a full company after them, and when I return, I expect him to make a show of the reward.</string>
  <string id="6097622">So many to deal with one qunari seems... excessive.</string>
  <string id="6097625">He may be Tal-Vashoth. The Winters leave nothing to chance.</string>
  <string id="6097628">Get out of my bloody way!</string>

  <string id="6097824">Mother's been in such a fit of melancholy since Gamlen told her how angry her parents were. About Father.</string>
  <string id="6097827">She told me she wishes she'd died with Carver.</string>
  <string id="6097830">It's like coming here ruined every good memory of her childhood. I wish we could get some of it back.</string>
  <string id="6097831">When this Deep Roads expedition comes through, we can buy her home back, move to Hightown.</string>
  <string id="6097832">Maybe we can buy the estate.</string>
  <string id="6097833">Unless we somehow turn Gamlen into an upstanding citizen, what's done is done.</string>
  <string id="6097834">We can't change it now.</string>
  <string id="6097835">We need to get that will.</string>
  <string id="6097836">We can.</string>
  <string id="6097837">Good. I'm glad we agree.</string>
  <string id="6097840">Gamlen told me he gave the estate as payment to some slaver who beat him at dice.</string>
  <string id="6097843">Apparently our ancestral home is now a base for slavers from all over Thedas.</string>
  <string id="6097844">How could Gamlen let that happen?</string>
  <string id="6097845">That's an outrage!</string>
  <string id="6097846">Where in the plot?</string>
  <string id="6097847">Quest Start</string>
  <string id="6097848">Quest Start</string>
  <string id="6097849">Varric's Suite</string>
  <string id="6097850">Serah Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6097853">Mother Petrice?</string>
  <string id="6097856">No longer. Titles change, as you have shown.</string>
  <string id="6097859">Unfortunately, people do not. I remember you appeasing the Qunari. It makes one wonder what kind of Champion Kirkwall has.</string>
  <string id="6097860">The kind that doesn't take kindly to accusations from old enemies.</string>
  <string id="6097861">A dangerous one.</string>
  <string id="6097862">The years have not tempered you.</string>
  <string id="6097863">A long time to hold a grudge.</string>
  <string id="6097864">You keep hitting that one note. Come on, what's new in hatred?</string>
  <string id="6097865">Same old Petrice.</string>
  <string id="6097866">Well earned, in your case. Kirkwall has the kind of Champion it needs.</string>
  <string id="6097867">And where have you been while I got things done?</string>
  <string id="6097868">No thanks to you.</string>
  <string id="6097869">We all have our strengths to exploit. Mine is finding like-minded people.</string>
  <string id="6097870">What kind is that, exactly?</string>
  <string id="6097871">And that is?</string>
  <string id="6097872">The reason I agreed with you is a little murky in retrospect.</string>
  <string id="6097873">Helping you seems creepy now.</string>
  <string id="6097876">I think there's a reason Mother didn't talk about him much.</string>
  <string id="6097879">Gamlen couldn't have just sold himself and saved us all the trouble?</string>
  <string id="6097880">He gave our home to slavers?</string>
  <string id="6097881">Giggles Can you just imagine him sweeping and scrubbing for some Tevinter matriarch?</string>
  <string id="6097884">Seriously, though. Those scum have no right to our family's things. We should break in there, get the will for Mother.</string>
  <string id="6097890">Good. Then we can break in and I don't care if we kill them.</string>
  <string id="6097891">Let's go after them.</string>
  <string id="6097892">I already talked to both of them about this. Gamlen said they guard the front entrance well.</string>
  <string id="6097895">But Mother gave me her old key. She said it should unlock the cellar. Apparently the sewers run right beneath the house.</string>
  <string id="6097898">We were friends for a brief moment. I had such hopes, as I am sure your pirate friend did.</string>
  <string id="6097901">You got rid of the Qunari—eventually—and should be commended. But we are watching.</string>
  <string id="6097902">On the contrary. I am inspired.</string>
  <string id="6097903">You will see, Serah Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6097904">One who is willing to fight when truth is challenged. You have been an inspiration.</string>
  <string id="6097905">Laughs I'll drink to that.</string>
  <string id="6098048">That's the vault!</string>
  <string id="6098051"> Everything we want to know about our family is inside.</string>
  <string id="6098055">I think this is the cellar door. Let's go in and see why Gamlen lied.</string>
  <string id="6098059">I can't wait to see what our ancestral estate was like.</string>
  <string id="6098062">Can you imagine? Mother gave all that up. For Father.</string>
  <string id="6098064">Did that bastard Gamlen put you up to this?</string>
  <string id="6098067">I knew I should've slit his throat.</string>

  <string id="6098196">Ha! It'll be just you and me and the ocean. Oh, and a couple dozen hands, but they don't really matter.</string>
  <string id="6098197">I can't just leave Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6098198">What about Merrill?</string>
  <string id="6098199">I can't just leave Anders.</string>
  <string id="6098200">What about Anders?</string>
  <string id="6098201">I am the Champion of Kirkwall. I need to stay here.</string>
  <string id="6098202">I have other commitments.</string>
  <string id="6098203">You're the Champion of Kirkwall. You can do whatever you please!</string>
  <string id="6098206">Well, if fame, fortune, and the adulation of Kirkwallers ever gets boring, the invitation's open.</string>
  <string id="6098209">I mean, I'd really hate to lose you.</string>
  <string id="6098215">I... uh, I'm sorry. I don't know what's come over me.</string>
  <string id="6098216">What's going through your mind?</string>
  <string id="6098217">You can trust me.</string>
  <string id="6098218">I'd just hate to have to say goodbye. You're the best friend I've had in... in a very long time.</string>
  <string id="6098223">Laughs A toast, to friendship and to us.</string>
  <string id="6098233">You're in a much different situation. Wealthy, respected. But do not forget where you came from.</string>
  <string id="6098240">Maker watch over you, Serah Hawke. Judgment will come.</string>
  <string id="6098249">I can't imagine what you mean.</string>
  <string id="6098250">Funny how that works.</string>
  <string id="6098251">I need to get into the city.</string>

  <string id="6098255">I need to get into the city.</string>
  <string id="6098256">What happened after that? I don't know. We all went our separate ways, for one reason or another.</string>
  <string id="6098259">Well... all of us except Anders, of course.</string>
  <string id="6098260">Well... all of us except Merrill, of course.</string>

  <string id="6098300">So how is hearing all this going to help? You've already lost all the Circles.</string>
  <string id="6098303">In fact, haven't the templars rebelled as well? I thought you decided to abandon the Chantry to hunt the mages.</string>
  <string id="6098306">Not all of us desire war, Varric.</string>
  <string id="6098309">Please, if you know where the Champion is, you must tell me.</string>

  <string id="6098394">Over here, you idiots!</string>
  <string id="6098395">Get over here!</string>
  <string id="6098399">Change of plans!</string>
  <string id="6098400">Let's try something else instead.</string>
  <string id="6098404">Just a swig of this...</string>
  <string id="6098405">Going to need something to get that blood pumping!</string>
  <string id="6098414">Shit!</string>
  <string id="6098415">These are new shoes!</string>
  <string id="6098419">I tire! I need help!</string>
  <string id="6098420">I can't go on!</string>
  <string id="6098429">I may have made an error in judgment...</string>
  <string id="6098430">I need healing!</string>
  <string id="6098431">Help me!</string>
  <string id="6098435">Ah, that really whets my appetite!</string>
  <string id="6098436">And you won't be the last one standing!</string>
  <string id="6098440">This isn't working!</string>
  <string id="6098441">I'll need a new weapon!</string>
  <string id="6098445">Watch out!</string>
  <string id="6098446">Look behind you!</string>
  <string id="6098450">Attack the mage, you fools!</string>
  <string id="6098455">The archer! Now!</string>
  <string id="6098460">You've bested me! I yield!</string>
  <string id="6098514">I suspected as much. It called him to the chantry.</string>
  <string id="6098517">I suspected as much. It was for a meeting with you and a templar.</string>
  <string id="6098520">Jump to a fight</string>
  <string id="6098521">Jump to a fight</string>
  <string id="6098522">Which fight?</string>
  <string id="6098523">Meredith end-game fight</string>
  <string id="6098524">Meredith end-game fight</string>
  <string id="6098525">Ready?</string>
  <string id="6098526">Go!</string>
  <string id="6098527">Go!</string>
  <string id="6098528">Exit</string>
  <string id="6098529">Exit</string>
  <string id="6098534">Report back to Meeran in Lowtown after dark.</string>
  <string id="6098535">Report back to Meeran in Lowtown after dark.</string>
  <string id="6098537">Meeran's task is complete.</string>
  <string id="6098540">Bianca and I are ready when you are, my friend.</string>
  <string id="6098544">It's pretty late? You ass.</string>
  <string id="6098547">May as well end as tense as it started.</string>
  <string id="6098550">Find Lord Harimann at the docks by day.</string>
  <string id="6098551">Meeran has a task outstanding. Find him in Lowtown after dark.</string>
  <string id="6098552">Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
I know we didn't part on the best terms. You were right, I was trying to squeeze more work out of you than was justified. You've more than paid your way into the city. It's been tight since you left, though. If you're looking for more work, for real coin in your pocket, come see me in Hightown, anytime before sunset.&#13;
&#13;
Athenril</string>
  <string id="6098553">Speak to Athenril in Hightown during the day.</string>
  <string id="6098557">Charade</string>
  <string id="6098563">Dead Refugee</string>
  <string id="6098569">Dead Refugee</string>
  <string id="6098591">What choice did I have? Things blow up and I respond.</string>
  <string id="6098594">Strike true, Ser Varnell. Kill that beast!</string>
  <string id="6098597">You're wasting time, Ser Varnell. End this so we can move forward.</string>
  <string id="6098600">Stop showing off and get on with it, Varnell. </string>
  <string id="6098603">Never mind.</string>
  <string id="6098604">Never mind.</string>
  <string id="6098611">So Gamlen couldn't even be bothered to come himself?</string>
  <string id="6098686">Thank you for rescuing Emrys, but Merin and Iwan are still out there!</string>
  <string id="6098700">You... did Iwan speak the truth? Were you too late?</string>
  <string id="6098704">You're back! Have you changed your mind about finding my boys?</string>
  <string id="6098706">That is the idea.</string>
  <string id="6098710">Question your methods, not my loyalty. If you want a fight, it's coming.</string>
  <string id="6098713">So much for subtle. You're about to have a war in the chantry.</string>
  <string id="6098716">Great plan. Your faithful are going to get spurred a lot sooner than you think.</string>
  <string id="6098719">Sorry, I haven't changed my mind.</string>
  <string id="6098720">No.</string>
  <string id="6098721">Then please, just leave me be.</string>
  <string id="6098726">Please hurry! My boys don't have much time left.</string>
  <string id="6098751">And you are closer to death than you know.</string>
  <string id="6098752">And you are closer to madness than faith.</string>
  <string id="6098766">So be it.</string>
  <string id="6098775">Iwan said Merin sealed himself in with the darkspawn to save his brothers.</string>
  <string id="6098776">Merin was a hero. He died saving his family. Be proud of your boy.</string>
  <string id="6098777">He's right.</string>
  <string id="6098778">Iwan locked Merin in with the darkspawn to get more treasure for himself.</string>
  <string id="6098779">Iwan's lying.</string>
  <string id="6098783">Is that how you remember your youngest brother dying?</string>
  <string id="6098784">Is that what happened, Emrys?</string>
  <string id="6098785">I... yes. It's just how Iwan said. Merin saved us.</string>
  <string id="6098795">...so I'm just saying, blood's blood and all, but you are taking advantage of my hospitality.</string>
  <string id="6098798">It's only fair if you make something of a... monthly contribution—</string>
  <string id="6098801">You sold my children into servitude! Now you're asking me to pay rent?</string>
  <string id="6098804">Er... maybe just put something towards food...</string>
  <string id="6098807">You should be paying us, Uncle.</string>
  <string id="6098810">Gamlen lied to you, Mother.</string>
  <string id="6098813">We found the will.</string>
  <string id="6098816">He forgave you, Mother. Grandfather left you everything.</string>
  <string id="6098819">Here. Read it!</string>
  <string id="6098822">Er, ah, I should... maybe...</string>
  <string id="6098825">To my daughter Leandra, and all children born of her... the estate in Hightown and all associated revenues...</string>
  <string id="6098826">We have a home, Mother. A real home.</string>
  <string id="6098827">The estate is ours.</string>
  <string id="6098828">They forgave me. Mother forgave me. But...</string>
  <string id="6098831">Check out the part where Gamlen is left only a stipend—to be controlled by you.</string>
  <string id="6098832">Keep reading.</string>
  <string id="6098833">Gamlen, how could you?</string>
  <string id="6098836">What do you have to say for yourself?</string>
  <string id="6098837">Not one step further, Uncle.</string>
  <string id="6098838">You're the one who ran away, Leandra. What happened to Love is so much more important than money...?</string>
  <string id="6098841">It is!</string>
  <string id="6098844">You didn't even come home for the funeral!</string>
  <string id="6098847">The twins were a week old!</string>
  <string id="6098850">We all have our burdens. Mine was looking after a life you abandoned. How long was I supposed to wait?</string>
  <string id="6098851">Grandfather left everything to Mother and us. I guess he had some sense after all. </string>
  <string id="6098865">Docks</string>
  <string id="6098872">Gone.</string>
  <string id="6098878">I had hoped... no, it doesn't matter any longer.</string>
  <string id="6098881">I assume Danarius left valuables behind. Take them if you wish. I... need some air.</string>
  <string id="6098895">He sends spirits to do his fighting for him.</string>
  <string id="6098898">Danarius! Can you hear me? Your pets cannot stop us!</string>
  <string id="6098901">Where are you, master?</string>
  <string id="6098902">I am not afraid of you, Danarius!</string>
  <string id="6098903">Back up Athenril's people at the docks after dark.</string>
  <string id="6098905">Defeat the thugs.</string>
  <string id="6098907">Return the goods to Athenril in Hightown during the day.</string>
  <string id="6098908">Report back to Athenril in Hightown during the day.</string>
  <string id="6098909">Athenril's task is complete.</string>
  <string id="6098917">The Amell crest. Mother described it. But this is the first time I've seen it.</string>
  <string id="6098920">Wouldn't it feel like something to live in a house with this above the door?</string>
  <string id="6098928">Liam leaves his office at nightfall. We could sneak in after dark, take a look at his records.</string>
  <string id="6098931">Merin died to keep his brothers alive—brothers who should be very, very grateful.</string>
  <string id="6098932">He's right.</string>
  <string id="6098933">Absolutely correct. Not a word of a lie. Merin died with dignity and honor. Yes.</string>
  <string id="6098934">He's right.</string>
  <string id="6098935">If you didn't just lose a son, I'd kill Iwan where he stands. He locked Merin in with the darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6098936">Iwan's lying.</string>
  <string id="6098937">If you want me to lie for you, you could have at least offered me a bribe first.</string>
  <string id="6098938">Iwan's lying.</string>
  <string id="6098945">Gamlen's House</string>
  <string id="6098947">If it wasn't for the Blight, would we ever have come back here?</string>
  <string id="6098948">He has a point.</string>
  <string id="6098949">I always thought I would. But... I suppose you three are Fereldan to your toes...</string>
  <string id="6098952">I doubt you let the ashes get cold.</string>
  <string id="6098953">Did you wait one minute?</string>
  <string id="6098954">I took care of Father. I stayed! And on his deathbed, all he could talk about was Leandra.</string>
  <string id="6098957">Look, Sister, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done it, but I did. And there's nothing I can do to get it back.</string>
  <string id="6098960">You'll spend the rest of your life paying my mother back for what you stole.</string>
  <string id="6098961">You owe us, Uncle.</string>
  <string id="6098962">Andraste's ass, I will!</string>
  <string id="6098965">I don't expect that, Gamlen. It's enough to know Mother and Father didn't die angry.</string>
  <string id="6098968">I'll petition the viscount for rights to reclaim the estate. Maker willing, you'll have your house back within weeks.</string>
  <string id="6098971">You don't have the coin or standing to even get an audience with the viscount.</string>
  <string id="6098974">You've got to be someone in this city to live in that house again.</string>
  <string id="6098977">Then I had better get started.</string>
  <string id="6099018">What are you talking about, messere?</string>
  <string id="6099021">Father... Merin didn't seal himself in with the darkspawn. Iwan—</string>
  <string id="6099024">Shut your mouth, Emrys!</string>
  <string id="6099027">No! I'm through listening to you, Iwan! You sealed Merin in with the darkspawn so you could go after that blighted weapon!</string>
  <string id="6099030">Iwan? Is this— Your own brother? Get out of my sight! I'll kill you myself if I see you again.</string>
  <string id="6099033">You cost me my family, Hawke. This isn't over.</string>
  <string id="6099071">Merin idolized you. He'd be honored to know you've acknowledged his... sacrifice.</string>
  <string id="6099074">You saved two of my boys. It's more than I could have asked for. Thank you, messere.</string>
  <string id="6099077">Huh. I guess I owe you one, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6099081">I don't care what business you think you have here, basra. The Arishok will not be disturbed at this hour.</string>
  <string id="6099082">The Arishok will not see anyone at this hour.</string>
  <string id="6099083">It is dark. Go away, basra vashedan.</string>
  <string id="6099086">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6099109">Gamlen's House</string>
  <string id="6099129">Return to Gamlen's Lowtown house to see how his talk with Charade went.</string>
  <string id="6099130">Take the gem back to Gamlen in Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6099133">My family came from Orzammar—noble House Tethras—until my father got caught fixing Provings.</string>
  <string id="6099140">Lost-End Foundry</string>
  <string id="6099155">I get the feeling you started this rumor.</string>
  <string id="6099156">Where'd they hear that?</string>
  <string id="6099157">How would anyone get that idea?</string>
  <string id="6099158">Oh, really?</string>
  <string id="6099159">That is a sorry mess of clichés. So much for the great storyteller.</string>
  <string id="6099160">Is that the best you can do?</string>
  <string id="6099163">He and our whole House got exiled. No huge loss. I was born up here. Sunshine suits me just fine.</string>
  <string id="6099168">Good luck, love. If it's ever a choice between profit and your neck, just come home to me safely. We'll find a way. </string>
  <string id="6099171">I can't believe you're dragging your sister into that filthy warren.</string>
  <string id="6099172">Take care of Carver. Don't let him charge off in search of eternal glory.</string>
  <string id="6099173">Thank you for not taking Bethany. I couldn't stand to risk you both.</string>
  <string id="6099174">Thank you for leaving Carver here. I'm afraid he still thinks of glory more than survival.</string>
  <string id="6099175">Please don't take Bethany with you. It would kill me to risk you both.</string>
  <string id="6099176">Please don't take Carver with you. He doesn't yet have your luck or skill.</string>
  <string id="6099181">When I told your grandmother I was marrying your father, she threatened to disown me.</string>
  <string id="6099184">She said my children would be mongrels. My father wanted to lock me in, but she told him, It's her life. Let her ruin it.</string>
  <string id="6099187">I wrote to her when each of you were born. She never wrote back. I'm glad she didn't die hating me.</string>
  <string id="6099188">Grandmother didn't want you to leave. She tried holding on to you the only way she knew.</string>
  <string id="6099189">She never hated you.</string>
  <string id="6099190">She would have been so proud of you. You're everything she wanted in an Amell grandchild.</string>
  <string id="6099193">Your mother's dead. Let it go.</string>
  <string id="6099194">She's not worth this.</string>
  <string id="6099195">I'm glad I never had to meet any of your family.</string>
  <string id="6099196">Sounds like a bitch.</string>
  <string id="6099197">When I was a girl, your grandmother was the young, beautiful, noble mother all my friends wished they had. </string>
  <string id="6099200">She might have had a hard time accepting it at first, but she would have loved you. All three of you.</string>
  <string id="6099203">Oh, Bethany... She was such a sweet little girl. Never cried... just looked at you with those big eyes.</string>
  <string id="6099204">She was so young to be taken from us.</string>
  <string id="6099205">I miss her, too.</string>
  <string id="6099206">Bethany would want you to move on, Mother. Be happy about what we have.</string>
  <string id="6099207">She wouldn't want you moping.</string>
  <string id="6099208">Carver... He was such a little boy. Never had a knee that wasn't scraped or trousers without holes.</string>
  <string id="6099209">He was so young. Never got to be the man he wanted.</string>
  <string id="6099210">I miss him, too.</string>
  <string id="6099211">The last thing Carver would want is more crying.</string>
  <string id="6099212">He wouldn't want us moping.</string>
  <string id="6099213">I'll come back when you're less maudlin.</string>
  <string id="6099214">Forget this.</string>
  <string id="6099228">I-I miss her.</string>
  <string id="6099231">At least you're past the it's all your fault thing.</string>
  <string id="6099232">Glad you're not blaming me.</string>
  <string id="6099233">Blame the darkspawn, not yourself.</string>
  <string id="6099234">There was nothing we could do.</string>
  <string id="6099235">I-I remember that awful creature reaching down and—</string>
  <string id="6099238">Eighteen years of loving and feeding and raising and... that was it.</string>
  <string id="6099241">I've written to the viscount. I've an audience for after Bartrand's expedition leaves.</string>
  <string id="6099244">I couldn't do anything for Bethany, but with luck, I can at least give us a home.</string>
  <string id="6099245">I couldn't do anything for Carver, but with luck, I can at least give us a home.</string>
  <string id="6099299">Gamlen's greatest treasure has been found.</string>
  <string id="6099307">I'll make this quick. I... Laughs Well, you know how I feel, and saying anything more would just be... too much.</string>
  <string id="6099310">Just know that I'm going to try my best to keep us both alive. I have plans for us, and most of them involve nakedness.</string>
  <string id="6099313">If one or both of us were dead, that could get really awkward.</string>
  <string id="6099317">Shouldn't you be halfway to Tevinter by now?</string>
  <string id="6099320">Maker's breath. Take off with a priceless relic once and you never hear the end of it!</string>
  <string id="6099321">Make sure you're ready. I need you at your best.</string>
  <string id="6099324">Don't worry. I'm not about to give you another reason to jabber on about how unreliable I am.</string>
  <string id="6099325">Don't worry. I'm not going to let you down.</string>
  <string id="6099326">You don't have to be here if you don't want to be.</string>
  <string id="6099329">And if I didn't want to be here, I wouldn't be.</string>
  <string id="6099335">It figures, doesn't it?</string>
  <string id="6099336">I know we've had our disagreements. I've wanted to choke you so many times that I've lost count.</string>
  <string id="6099339">But I... I don't regret any of it. Knowing you has made me want to become a better person.</string>
  <string id="6099343">I'm honored to hear you say that.</string>
  <string id="6099344">That means a lot to me.</string>
  <string id="6099345">I knew there was a heart in there, somewhere, preserved by years of hard drinking.</string>
  <string id="6099346">You always had it in you.</string>
  <string id="6099347">I hope this doesn't mean you'll go easy on our enemies.</string>
  <string id="6099348">Make sure you can still fight.</string>
  <string id="6099349">Don't worry, I'll still be fighting dirty. I'll just be doing it for the right reasons.</string>
  <string id="6099352">Your life would have been easier if you had just cut me out of it.</string>
  <string id="6099356">I've no illusions about this. I know I might not survive this conflict, but I'm not going to run away. Not this time.</string>
  <string id="6099359">I'm ready for whatever comes.</string>
  <string id="6099367">But you stood by me. You defied the Qunari and fought their Arishok for me, even after I betrayed you.</string>
  <string id="6099368">Competition? Well, you're too late. The Winters... I have already claimed him.</string>
  <string id="6099391">Have you been underground?</string>
  <string id="6099392">You're looking for excitement?</string>
  <string id="6099393">Have you been underground?</string>
  <string id="6099394">You're looking for excitement?</string>
  <string id="6099395">Are you a merchant? A mercenary?</string>
  <string id="6099396">What do you do?</string>
  <string id="6099397">I am a younger son. It's a difficult and dangerous profession. A lot of us die of boredom.</string>
  <string id="6099400">Fortunately, being Bartrand's younger brother keeps me on my toes. Maker knows he lacks subtlety.</string>
  <string id="6099403">I'm the one who pulls strings to keep the Coterie out of our hair—keep us just a whisker ahead of the other families.</string>
  <string id="6099404">Have you been underground?</string>
  <string id="6099405">You're looking for excitement?</string>
  <string id="6099408">The thaig we're looking for is supposed to be a week's travel from the surface. So I hope you aren't scared of the dark.</string>
  <string id="6099411">We've got supplies, muscle, excavators... the plan is to carry out everything that's not nailed down.</string>
  <string id="6099412">Have you been underground?</string>
  <string id="6099413">So you're in this for thrills?</string>
  <string id="6099414">It's funny. Now that I think about it, getting a ship just doesn't seem that important.</string>
  <string id="6099417">Everything I care about is here. You're here.</string>
  <string id="6099420">I'm making you uncomfortable. I'll just leave.</string>
  <string id="6099421">Maybe I should go.</string>
  <string id="6099422">Please don't say something you might regret.</string>
  <string id="6099423">I'm stopping you there.</string>
  <string id="6099443">Ashaad's traps! Oh, bless that hunter, I can set his traps! Just tell me where!</string>
  <string id="6099451">Well, think about staying. Kirkwall's boring without you.</string>
  <string id="6099456">If nothing else, you give this town respectability, my friend.</string>
  <string id="6099459">Oh, don't get all teary-eyed on me, Hawke. You know I can't stand to see a human cry.</string>
  <string id="6099460">No, don't! I need to say this. If I don't, it will never get said.</string>
  <string id="6099461">You're right. I... I just need a drink. I'll be around, if you need me.</string>
  <string id="6099469">Meeran</string>
  <string id="6099473">I still can't believe Iwan would do this to his own brothers.</string>
  <string id="6099476">I think I... I think I'm falling for you.</string>
  <string id="6099479">Just tell me, Hawke, if I have a chance with you.</string>
  <string id="6099480">Coterie Assassin</string>
  <string id="6099484">Then we ready ourselves.</string>
  <string id="6099485">It's not the worst place to be trapped like rats.</string>
  <string id="6099486">Well, let's get ready, then.</string>
  <string id="6099487">If they come, they come.</string>
  <string id="6099488">Like nugs in a box. Never liked nugs.</string>

  <string id="6099502">Promise you won't run off and break my heart.</string>
  <string id="6099503">You're not going to flee?</string>
  <string id="6099504">I've waited years for you.</string>
  <string id="6099505">What took you so long?</string>
  <string id="6099506">Didn't you say love wasn't for you?</string>
  <string id="6099507">Why the change of heart?</string>
  <string id="6099522">Then bring her along! A blood mage obsessed with mirrors is a useful thing to have on a ship.</string>
  <string id="6099525">Who says you have to leave him? He could come along! I'm sure I could find some use for him.</string>
  <string id="6099528">I won't if you don't give me a reason to.</string>
  <string id="6099529">Oh, you do know how to flatter a girl.</string>
  <string id="6099532">Laughs</string>
  <string id="6099535">It'll be you and me chasing that horizon. I can't think of any place I'd rather be.</string>
  <string id="6099538">Laughs They say in Llomerryn that a true friend is as constant as the northern star.</string>
  <string id="6099541">Hawke, you wound me. That's not my story.</string>
  <string id="6099542">You of all people should know how the public takes up an idea and runs wild with it.</string>
  <string id="6099543">Oh, that's not my work. I'm shocked that you can't recognize the difference, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6099548">So, we've got a whole city-state full of trouble to get into. Shall we get started?</string>
  <string id="6099561">You missed your chance.</string>
  <string id="6099562">Too late.</string>
  <string id="6099577">I want to be someone you'd be proud to... be with.</string>
  <string id="6099583">Conspirator's Notes</string>
  <string id="6099586">No games, Fereldan. You've been a puppet for years.</string>
  <string id="6099589">I see no reason to start listening to you now.</string>
  <string id="6099590">These things should be ousted from Kirkwall!</string>
  <string id="6099591">I want them dead too!</string>
  <string id="6099592">Hatred has blinded you to potential allies.</string>
  <string id="6099593">I am no friend of the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6099594">You think I like being in the middle of this? </string>
  <string id="6099595">I've been used by both sides.</string>
  <string id="6099597">Here's your proof.</string>
  <string id="6099635">Undercity Warrens</string>
  <string id="6099647">Qunari Compound</string>
  <string id="6099648">And they will be. Along with the outside influence that weakened our leaders. And we start with you.</string>
  <string id="6099651">Not blindness. Focus. Something our leaders have forgotten.</string>
  <string id="6099654">Then fall by the wayside. True sons of Kirkwall will do what needs to be done.</string>
  <string id="6099665">I'm ready, and I'm not going to let this ridiculous conflict ruin what we have.</string>
  <string id="6099666">I should concentrate on getting ready. Anything left to be said can wait till we're not on the brink of disaster.</string>
  <string id="6099688">Arianni's House</string>
  <string id="6099698">All set!</string>
  <string id="6099699">Going for more traps!</string>
  <string id="6099701">You came back to help me. Defending you from the Arishok was the least I could do.</string>
  <string id="6099702">Friendship goes both ways.</string>
  <string id="6099703">If you'd gone with them, I wouldn't have been able to yell at you.</string>
  <string id="6099704"> I couldn't let them take you.</string>
  <string id="6099705">I just don't like the Qunari all that much.</string>
  <string id="6099706">It wasn't just about you.</string>
  <string id="6099709">What? You mean Castillon's?</string>
  <string id="6099716">Carver needs healing!</string>
  <string id="6099719">I have a poultice. Have him use this.</string>
  <string id="6099725">No Rest for the Wicked</string>
  <string id="6099729">Please find Merin. He's like a son to me.</string>

  <string id="6099731">Loose Ends</string>
  <string id="6099732">But the Champion is not in Kirkwall any longer.</string>
  <string id="6099735">So I hear! Isn't it strange how quickly fortunes change?</string>

  <string id="6099983">You're doing well.</string>
  <string id="6099987">Right. We need more traps. I'm ready. Ready!</string>
  <string id="6100004">And don't think I'm not grateful for that.</string>
  <string id="6100011">Oh. Well, I'm glad you wanted to yell at me so badly then.</string>
  <string id="6100014">I know I don't exactly inspire confidence, but I swear I'm going to come through for you this time.</string>
  <string id="6100017">When you look for me, I'll be fighting at your side.</string>
  <string id="6100024">Leave</string>
  <string id="6100025">Leave</string>
  <string id="6100029">Well, all right. But don't get used to it.</string>
  <string id="6100032">I finally find someone I want to be with, and the templars decide to go crazy and kill everyone.</string>
  <string id="6100033">I finally find someone I want to be with, and suddenly everything is exploding.</string>
  <string id="6100040">Tell me I'm not going to lose you.</string>
  <string id="6100042">Exactly.</string>
  <string id="6100052">You won't.</string>
  <string id="6100053">Who knows? I could survive, but you could die.</string>
  <string id="6100054">Anything could happen.</string>
  <string id="6100057">We have to be prepared for the worst. Be strong.</string>
  <string id="6100058">Anything could happen.</string>
  <string id="6100059">It wouldn't work out between us.</string>
  <string id="6100060">This isn't a good idea.</string>
  <string id="6100061">Oh. I... I see.</string>
  <string id="6100064">Can we pretend I never said anything? I... need a drink.</string>
  <string id="6100073">I won't be taken down by a bunch of mages.</string>
  <string id="6100074">I won't be taken down by a bunch of templars.</string>
  <string id="6100075">I promise we'll get through this.</string>
  <string id="6100076">You won't.</string>
  <string id="6100077">That would make the sex very awkward.</string>
  <string id="6100078">I'm going to hold you to that, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6100081">I took a chance on love. Don't let me down. Don't you dare.</string>
  <string id="6100085">It's clear this was not your first encounter with this Ashaad.</string>
  <string id="6100086">You knew the Qunari before?</string>
  <string id="6100087">I had so many doubts. Qunari have none. </string>
  <string id="6100094">Let's go, Saemus. Your father will be waiting in the Keep.</string>
  <string id="6100095">I'll get you back to Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6100104">We'll leave soon enough, Saemus. Be ready.</string>
  <string id="6100105">Wait here while I look around.</string>
  <string id="6100106">I am at your whim, serah.</string>
  <string id="6100114">Aveline!</string>
  <string id="6100130">I am ready to leave, and you have coin to collect, I'm sure.</string>
  <string id="6100131">I am Aveline Vallen. This is my husband, Ser Wesley. We can hate each other when we're safe from the horde.</string>
  <string id="6100134">Don't worry. For once I've something real to fight for. I'm not going to let that go.</string>
  <string id="6100141">I'm not leaving. If you insist on fighting for some principle or other, I'm going to be right beside you.</string>
  <string id="6100213">Time for a drink.</string>
  <string id="6100233">They are lyrium, burned into my flesh to provide the power that Danarius required of his pet.</string>
  <string id="6100236">And now he wishes his precious investment returned, even if he must rip it from my corpse.</string>
  <string id="6100237">Seems like a waste of a perfectly handsome elf.</string>
  <string id="6100238">That would be a shame.</string>
  <string id="6100239">Chuckles</string>
  <string id="6100242">You aren't afraid I'll sell you out?</string>
  <string id="6100243">So they're valuable.</string>
  <string id="6100244">I am now.</string>
  <string id="6100247">Perhaps you can find a way to pay him back?</string>
  <string id="6100248">Can you repay him?</string>
  <string id="6100249">I will pay him back— in blood.</string>
  <string id="6100252">You have no idea what he's done to me, what I went through just to get away.</string>
  <string id="6100255">How could I? I don't know the first thing about you.</string>
  <string id="6100256">Of course not.</string>
  <string id="6100257">I was only trying to help you.</string>
  <string id="6100258">I meant no offense.</string>
  <string id="6100259">I think I'm beginning to get the picture.</string>
  <string id="6100260">I can imagine.</string>
  <string id="6100261">I... I'm sorry. That was unworthy of me.</string>
  <string id="6100264">I don't see that going very well for you.</string>
  <string id="6100265">That would hurt.</string>
  <string id="6100266">Neither do I.</string>
  <string id="6100276">You've said Danarius is a magister, but little else.</string>
  <string id="6100277">Tell me about Danarius.</string>
  <string id="6100278">In Tevinter, the magisters hold all the power: over the Chantry, over the Imperial Court, over life itself.</string>
  <string id="6100281">It is nothing for one to own a slave. Danarius had many, but none he valued so much as me.</string>
  <string id="6100282">Then how did you get away?</string>
  <string id="6100283">But you escaped.</string>
  <string id="6100284">Is it not enough that I did?</string>
  <string id="6100287">I carved my path to freedom in blood. I left that life behind, yet his bounty hunters follow me no matter where I go.</string>
  <string id="6100290">I will run no longer.</string>
  <string id="6100291">Your old master must want something more than just a runaway slave.</string>
  <string id="6100292">Why is Danarius after you?</string>
  <string id="6100297">I've seen some of your abilities. Do they come from those markings?</string>
  <string id="6100298">What can you do?</string>
  <string id="6100299">Some.</string>
  <string id="6100305">All I know is that, even in the Imperium, warriors such as myself are rare. Perhaps they believe I should feel honored?</string>
  <string id="6100306">Do you think your master will keep chasing you?</string>
  <string id="6100307">Will the hunters return?</string>
  <string id="6100308">He is too proud not to.</string>
  <string id="6100311">Perhaps one day the hunt will cost him more than he is willing to pay, but I doubt that matters any longer.</string>
  <string id="6100312">I think it's time for us to part ways.</string>
  <string id="6100313">I don't need you.</string>
  <string id="6100314">As you wish.</string>
  <string id="6100317">Banavis fedari. May the ground rise to meet your feet.</string>
  <string id="6100320">I'm planning an expedition I might need help with.</string>
  <string id="6100321">I could use your help.</string>
  <string id="6100322">Fair enough.</string>
  <string id="6100341">You can speak to me directly.</string>
  <string id="6100353">Ah, here it comes.</string>
  <string id="6100356">I saw you casting spells inside. I should have realized sooner what you really were.</string>
  <string id="6100359">You harbor a viper in your midst. It will turn on you and strike when you least expect. That is in its nature.</string>
  <string id="6100360">I don't remember you objecting too strenuously while we were fighting.</string>
  <string id="6100361">But a mage helped you.</string>
  <string id="6100376">I know the danger.</string>
  <string id="6100377">I'm well aware.</string>
  <string id="6100385">Tell me, then: What manner of mage are you? What is it that you seek?</string>
  <string id="6100415">Talk to</string>
  <string id="6100754">Loot the bodies!</string>
  <string id="6100758">We should search them, see if there's any further evidence of their plans.</string>
  <string id="6100759">Search them. There's got to be more than this.</string>
  <string id="6100760">Search the bodies. Where there's this many, there's bound to be more.</string>
  <string id="6100761">We should search the bodies, see if they've got any further information. Or gold teeth!</string>
  <string id="6100762">Shall we search the bodies? They might have further evidence of their plans.</string>
  <string id="6100763">Care to do the honors? I'm sure if we search them, we'll find something more to go on.</string>
  <string id="6100764">If we kill them, we get their stuff!</string>
  <string id="6100768">They have another meeting spot. Near the docks.</string>
  <string id="6100769">Looks like they use a warehouse by the docks as their meeting spot.</string>
  <string id="6100770">We should head to the docks. That seems to be their main meeting place.</string>
  <string id="6100771">Of course they hold their meetings in a warehouse by the docks. Doesn't anyone go there just to have sex anymore?</string>
  <string id="6100772">Shall we go to this warehouse? Try to find their leadership?</string>
  <string id="6100773">Another secret society, meeting in a warehouse. Do you think the owners charge them rent?</string>
  <string id="6100999">I can't believe Gamlen stole Mother's entire inheritance! I mean, I can believe it—that's the worst part.</string>
  <string id="6101002">I could never turn against my own sister like that.</string>
  <string id="6101003">I would never turn against you.</string>
  <string id="6101004">You're a better person than Gamlen could ever be.</string>
  <string id="6101005">Don't compare yourself to him.</string>
  <string id="6101006">Don't make any hasty promises.</string>
  <string id="6101007">I don't know about that...</string>
  <string id="6101008">Joke all you want, but you make Gamlen look like the toad he is.</string>
  <string id="6101011">Talking about Gamlen leaves a bad taste in my mouth.</string>
  <string id="6101012">Let's not do this.</string>
  <string id="6101013">Well, hopefully, we'll be out of here soon.</string>
  <string id="6101016">You know, when we went to look for that will, I thought we were doing it for Mother, for what she lost.</string>
  <string id="6101019">I didn't realize how much it would mean to me. To know I had grandparents who didn't hate me.</string>
  <string id="6101020">I wish they had lived long enough to see us come home.</string>
  <string id="6101021">I know how you feel.</string>
  <string id="6101022">They might have been all right with the Ferelden thing, but just imagine if they'd known you were an apostate...</string>
  <string id="6101023">They just didn't know you...</string>
  <string id="6101024">You're such a wretch!</string>
  <string id="6101027">I was just hoping it would be different this time. Here, in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6101030">Mother's parents sound like stuck-up pigs. Who cares what they thought?</string>
  <string id="6101031">It means nothing to me.</string>
  <string id="6101032">They're our family. A noble lineage dating back to the last Blight. Aren't you a little curious?</string>
  <string id="6101035">It just makes it feel not as bad, being here, you know?</string>
  <string id="6101038">I just keep thinking there's something we could have done. It's killing me.</string>
  <string id="6101056">Er... I see.</string>
  <string id="6101057">It's from your homeland.</string>
  <string id="6101058">It's Rivaini.</string>
  <string id="6101059">It's a Rivaini talisman.</string>
  <string id="6101062">Sometimes people get things for other people they like. This is the part where you say thank you.</string>
  <string id="6101063">It's a gift.</string>
  <string id="6101064">Not your sort of thing? Never mind, I'll just discard it.</string>
  <string id="6101065">You don't like it.</string>
  <string id="6101066">No, I don't dislike it. It's just... you know what this is, right?</string>
  <string id="6101069">It's a Rivaini fertility talisman.</string>
  <string id="6101072">These petal-like shapes represent... certain fleshy bits, and this protrusion is... well, just look!</string>
  <string id="6101073">I knew it was a little crude. I just thought you'd appreciate it. You like... vulgar things.</string>
  <string id="6101074">I knew what it was.</string>
  <string id="6101075">Ah. Oh dear. And all this time I thought it was just a flower.</string>
  <string id="6101076">Oops. Now I see it.</string>
  <string id="6101077">It's just a pretty flower.</string>
  <string id="6101078">I don't see anything wrong.</string>
  <string id="6101079">I know that, you goose. Don't you know what this is?</string>
  <string id="6101083">Well, yes, books with bawdy poetry and pictures to illustrate, but this is... something else.</string>
  <string id="6101086">You keep thinking that if it makes you feel better.</string>
  <string id="6101112">I think saving your life is payment enough. Or do you want to go back on that deal?</string>
  <string id="6101113">I could kill you for it.</string>
  <string id="6101114">I really don't want to get your blood on me, but you're being so unreasonable!</string>
  <string id="6101115">I could kill you for it.</string>
  <string id="6101124">Just take the coin and get out of here before I change my mind.</string>
  <string id="6101125">I'll pay you in silver.</string>
  <string id="6101130">You sure you want to be down here? The last time it really didn't end well.</string>
  <string id="6101131">Will you be all right down here after what happened with Carver?</string>
  <string id="6101132">Brave of you to return here, considering what happened to your sister.</string>
  <string id="6101133">I hope this won't be a repeat of the last time you were down here.</string>
  <string id="6101134">I'm not looking forward to this. Last time we were down here, we both lost a sibling.</string>
  <string id="6101135">It must be hard returning to the place where you lost your brother.</string>
  <string id="6101136">Will you be all right down here after what happened with Bethany?</string>
  <string id="6101137">Brave of you to return here, considering what happened to your brother.</string>
  <string id="6101138">It must be hard returning to the place where you lost your sister.</string>
  <string id="6101139">For now, we move with you. North is cut off. We barely escaped the main body of the horde.</string>
  <string id="6101144">Sabina</string>
  <string id="6101146">Bring Isabela to Velasco. He spends his nights at the Blooming Rose.</string>
  <string id="6101147">Follow Isabela's trail to Lowtown. The trail will be easier to see at night.</string>
  <string id="6101148">Velasco is dead. Find Isabela.</string>
  <string id="6101149">Search the warehouse for details on Castillon's Kirkwall business.</string>
  <string id="6101150">Castillon was set free, and Isabela now owns a ship.</string>
  <string id="6101151">Castillon was killed.</string>
  <string id="6101159">And the world's rid of one more Qunari. Easier than I expected.</string>
  <string id="6101162">Ashaad... you killed him. You... you vashedan bitch!</string>
  <string id="6101172">Serah! If I must go back, so be it, but I will not see these... murderers rewarded!</string>
  <string id="6101175">Spoiled shit! I'll cut out your tongue and charge extra for bringing you back quiet!</string>
  <string id="6101181">And as for you... I could do with some entertainment while we wait for the others.</string>
  <string id="6101185">Home. That's what it is, isn't it? I like saying that.</string>
  <string id="6101188">What do you mean, running away again?</string>
  <string id="6101189">Again?</string>
  <string id="6101190">Did you think I don't know? How often we had to move because the templars were coming?</string>
  <string id="6101193">I know how much you all sacrificed to protect me.</string>
  <string id="6101196">But we're at the end of the line now. There's nowhere left to run. And there's something almost comforting in that.</string>
  <string id="6101198">We're home now.</string>
  <string id="6101199">Are you unhappy here?</string>
  <string id="6101200">You sound sad.</string>
  <string id="6101201">I wish I could do more for Mother. Carver's death... it's killing her slowly, every day.</string>
  <string id="6101204">But maybe if we can reclaim some of what she lost, it will help.</string>
  <string id="6101207">I'd do anything to get us back a normal life.</string>
  <string id="6101209">We're home now.</string>
  <string id="6101210">Can you imagine if we'd grown up here? Been nobility? </string>
  <string id="6101211">What would it have been like?</string>
  <string id="6101212">Had grandparents who bought us Orlesian silk dresses with lace petticoats.</string>
  <string id="6101215">Had grandparents who bought me Orlesian silk dresses and gave you the family broadsword.</string>
  <string id="6101218">Father was a good man, but... Mother gave up so much for him.</string>
  <string id="6101221">Of course, if she hadn't worked up the nerve to elope, she probably wouldn't have been able to resist the templars, either.</string>
  <string id="6101224">If we'd been born here, you'd be nothing more to me than a name the Circle kept in my file.</string>
  <string id="6101225">What do you think Carver would have made of all this?</string>
  <string id="6101226">What would Carver have said?</string>
  <string id="6101227">We're going to make this our home, Bethany. I promise you.</string>
  <string id="6101228">We are home.</string>
  <string id="6101229">Let's see if Mother gets us that mansion. I don't want to call anywhere Uncle Gamlen is home.</string>
  <string id="6101230">Don't get too comfortable.</string>
  <string id="6101231">Our home was destroyed by the darkspawn. This will never be anything but a refugee camp.</string>
  <string id="6101232">This will never be home.</string>
  <string id="6101234">We're home now.</string>
  <string id="6101235">He would have hated this place. All the sneering nobles. He'd have gotten himself arrested the first day.</string>
  <string id="6101238">And he would have wanted in on your Deep Roads expedition. Anything to make a name for himself.</string>
  <string id="6101241">Sometimes I still can't believe he's gone.</string>
  <string id="6101243">We're home now.</string>
  <string id="6101244">I hope so, Sister.</string>
  <string id="6101247">I hope so, Brother.</string>
  <string id="6101250">I'm so very tired of running.</string>
  <string id="6101251">Giggles Has he moved that bowl of porridge since we've been here? It's been a year.</string>
  <string id="6101254">I can't even remember what it was like to have a place of our own.</string>
  <string id="6101257">I might even take the Circle if they'll give me a clean bed and my own sheets.</string>
  <string id="6101258">We're never going back to Ferelden, Sister.</string>
  <string id="6101261">We're never going back to Ferelden, Brother.</string>
  <string id="6101264">You can be more here than you ever could have been in Lothering.</string>
  <string id="6101267">Just give it a chance.</string>
  <string id="6101270">Why did Mother and Father work so hard to keep you from the Circle? Would it have been so bad?</string>
  <string id="6101271">Why avoid the Circle?</string>
  <string id="6101272">I guess at first... I was just a little girl. They didn't want to lose me.</string>
  <string id="6101275">And once I had learned anything... what would the templars do to an active apostate, not just a mage-blood child?</string>
  <string id="6101278">It changed their lives, your life, Carver's. All because of who I am.</string>
  <string id="6101281">Sometimes I wonder if it would have been so bad to be with my own kind, to serve the Chantry as Andraste demands.</string>
  <string id="6101282">We're home now.</string>
  <string id="6101283">Soil yourself later. There may be more.</string>
  <string id="6101284">Keep it together.</string>
  <string id="6101285">I don't need you falling apart. There may be more men on the way.</string>
  <string id="6101286">There's no time for whining.</string>
  <string id="6101292">Ashaad never lied, never coddled. You were worth his time, or you were not.</string>
  <string id="6101318">I know you're there. Show yourself!</string>
  <string id="6101325">Is someone there? It's safe, you can come out.</string>
  <string id="6101326">Whoever's hiding had better come out. Unless you're a dragon. Then feel free to keep hiding.</string>
  <string id="6101332">They are not the brutes others claim they are. Take me to my father, and I will try again to make him see.</string>
  <string id="6101333">The viscount is clearly concerned about your safety.</string>
  <string id="6101334">Your father is worried.</string>
  <string id="6101337">I wasn't aware that Qunari take many friends.</string>
  <string id="6101338">Still an odd friend to have.</string>
  <string id="6101339">I confess, I'm not sure what one does with a dead Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6101340">Do you want to bury Ashaad?</string>
  <string id="6101352">Hello?</string>
  <string id="6101356">Praise Andras— I mean the Creators. I thought I'd never get out of—</string>
  <string id="6101357">Oh. Good. Another ship I can't get to.</string>
  <string id="6101358">Ooh, what's this? Oh, isn't that just the cutest thing?</string>
  <string id="6101361">I never thought it would come to this.</string>
  <string id="6101364">Merrill?</string>
  <string id="6101367">Aneth ara, Pol. Are you hurt?</string>
  <string id="6101370">Stay back! What do you want from me?</string>
  <string id="6101375">Pol, what's wrong? I'm here to help!</string>
  <string id="6101376">With Carver... I never got the chance to say goodbye.</string>
  <string id="6101379">I don't want that to happen this time. Sister, if we... if we don't make it... just know that I love you.</string>
  <string id="6101382">I won't let that happen now. Brother, if we... don't come back from this, never doubt that I love you.</string>
  <string id="6101385">I wouldn't have chosen this life, but the Maker gave it to me for a reason. Maybe this is it.</string>
  <string id="6101386">Does that mean you forgive me?</string>
  <string id="6101387">Are you still angry?</string>
  <string id="6101388">I used to imagine what would have happened if I'd stayed with Mother instead of going on that damned expedition.</string>
  <string id="6101391">Was Carver not enough for the darkspawn? Did they have to steal my life as well?</string>
  <string id="6101392">Of all we did, if you could change one thing, what would it be?</string>
  <string id="6101393">What would you do differently?</string>
  <string id="6101394">I couldn't ask for a better sister.</string>
  <string id="6101395">I love you, too.</string>
  <string id="6101396">He picked one damned roundabout way to do it.</string>
  <string id="6101397">The Maker's got nerve.</string>
  <string id="6101398">Don't talk like that.</string>
  <string id="6101399">We're not going to die.</string>
  <string id="6101402">Stay back! Don't touch me!</string>
  <string id="6101408">Get out of my face.</string>
  <string id="6101411">Your mother's bad enough. I don't need you nagging me.</string>
  <string id="6101413">Leave that alone! There are things in my life that don't actually involve you, you know. Stay out of my business, boy.</string>
  <string id="6101422">Hello, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6101425">That's it?</string>
  <string id="6101429">Been a while. Hasn't it?</string>
  <string id="6101430">Nice to see I'm missed.</string>
  <string id="6101433">What? Oh, right. Sorry, it feels like we just talked. I've been keeping an eye on you.</string>
  <string id="6101436">But the Wardens serve a purpose, a noble one. I can't regret helping them.</string>
  <string id="6101437">I'd have thrown Carver on his stupid ass so he wouldn't attack that ogre. He was always such a show-off.</string>
  <string id="6101440">Everything else... the Maker is wiser than we can be in a lifetime.</string>
  <string id="6101443">Who am I to question His plan?</string>
  <string id="6101444">Laughs You never change, do you?</string>
  <string id="6101447">Maybe the Maker knew we needed that much time to understand.</string>
  <string id="6101450">Thank you for supporting my people. It means a lot that you, at least, haven't turned against us.</string>
  <string id="6101451">Prove me wrong, Sister.</string>
  <string id="6101452">Prove me wrong, Brother.</string>
  <string id="6101455">I thought you liked ships.</string>
  <string id="6101456">Don't you like it?</string>
  <string id="6101457">I like real ships. The kind that go on the ocean and take you places. Not tiny made of twigs and stuck in a bottle ships.</string>
  <string id="6101460">I should get a craftsman to make a teeny tiny Isabela and stick it on the teeny tiny ship. She could be waving!</string>
  <string id="6101461">Isn't it cute?</string>
  <string id="6101465">Stick it on a shelf somewhere. For decoration.</string>
  <string id="6101466">It's an ornament.</string>
  <string id="6101467">Oh, and what should I decorate? This bar?</string>
  <string id="6101470">Maybe I'll just put this right here and stare at it dolefully while I drink. What fun.</string>
  <string id="6101471">This was wasted on you.</string>
  <string id="6101472">You're such a bitch.</string>
  <string id="6101473">You can take it back then. Good luck finding some use for a tiny ship in a bottle.</string>
  <string id="6101479">That's the whole point, really.</string>
  <string id="6101480">Exactly.</string>
  <string id="6101484">May the Maker bless you and keep you, Sister.</string>
  <string id="6101487">May the Maker bless you and keep you, Brother.</string>
  <string id="6101490">Maybe it's His favor you seek by siding with Meredith. If so, I hope you lead us both into His light.</string>
  <string id="6101491">A strange time to be hunting apostates. His fellows left with the Chantry priests.</string>
  <string id="6101492">Why are you out here?</string>
  <string id="6101493">All these years, I've tried to understand what Andraste saw. Why she had to lock us up.</string>
  <string id="6101496">But my powers come from the Maker... and I just cannot believe that is His will.</string>
  <string id="6101501">Be still! You'll attract the varterral's attention!</string>
  <string id="6101502">Stop that!</string>
  <string id="6101503">Be calm, Pol. We'll help you get back to the camp.</string>
  <string id="6101504">We won't hurt you.</string>
  <string id="6101505">Merrill couldn't hurt you if she tried. At worst, she might make frowny faces.</string>
  <string id="6101506">It's only Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6101514">Being in the Circle must have been hard. Do you ever wish you'd come on the expedition?</string>
  <string id="6101515">Do you have regrets?</string>
  <string id="6101516">If I had, who knows where I'd be now?</string>
  <string id="6101519">I always thought it was hard growing up outside the Circle, always on the run. I never realized how free I was.</string>
  <string id="6101522">Maybe it took being locked in the Gallows to understand my place in this world. To see the need to free my fellow mages.</string>
  <string id="6101523">He just enjoys watching us rip each other apart.</string>
  <string id="6101524">The Maker likes us to squirm.</string>
  <string id="6101525">I cannot believe that. The Maker is just and merciful. This injustice was created by men.</string>
  <string id="6101528">A new age begins today. People will overcome their fears and find better ways to live with mages.</string>
  <string id="6101531">Whether we live to see it or not, a new day is coming, Sister.</string>
  <string id="6101534">Whether we live to see it or not, a new day is coming, Brother.</string>
  <string id="6101540">I wish Mother had lived long enough to see this. I hope she's found peace.</string>
  <string id="6101541">I saw it and thought it would be perfect for you.</string>
  <string id="6101542">It reminded me of you.</string>
  <string id="6101543">It is. This is probably the only ship I'm going to have for a while.</string>
  <string id="6101546">How pathetic is that? Cooing over a model ship?</string>
  <string id="6101547">You can't see it, but below deck there's a perfect replica of you with a dozen sailors in attendance.</string>
  <string id="6101548">The best thing is below decks.</string>
  <string id="6101549">You tease. I'm sure there isn't. It is a worthy goal to work towards, however.</string>
  <string id="6101556">I'm told it's a perfect replica of a Antivan frigate.</string>
  <string id="6101557">It's not cute.</string>
  <string id="6101558">I wouldn't call it perfect, but it does come close.</string>
  <string id="6101560">Keep your assumptions. He doesn't hear me. He is as tired of being disappointed as I am of bearing it.</string>
  <string id="6101564">The body is no longer him and is worthy of no special treatment. That is apparently their way.</string>
  <string id="6101696">I'm with you.</string>
  <string id="6101697">Point the way, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6101698">Always where you need.</string>
  <string id="6101703">Thank you, Hawke. This was a thoughtful gesture.</string>
  <string id="6101721">Hawke. I need... a favor that I can only trust to you.</string>
  <string id="6101727">This doesn't sound good.</string>
  <string id="6101764">Nothing going on, Hawke. You'd be the first to know if there was.</string>
  <string id="6101767">Nothing going on, but trouble tends to follow you, so, I'm keeping an eye out.</string>
  <string id="6101770">Hello, Hawke. Another time? I'm a little busy.</string>
  <string id="6101794">No! Keep away from me, monster!</string>
  <string id="6101795">You don't know what she is! What she's done!</string>
  <string id="6101796">She'll do worse than hurt me! Don't you know what she is?</string>
  <string id="6101810">Then take me to him.</string>
  <string id="6101813">Oh, look! That dead rat's still in the corner.</string>
  <string id="6101814">Ah, I do love seedy taverns, and the Hanged Man is the seediest of them all.</string>
  <string id="6101815">Dark, dingy, and smells like a rat's bottom, but it's home.</string>
  <string id="6101823">Creators, help me! Someone, please!</string>
  <string id="6101826">Information is one of the few perks of this job. Watch out for Bartrand—he's a son of a bitch.</string>
  <string id="6101827">You know I don't like it when you have people watch me.</string>
  <string id="6101828">You were spying on me again?</string>
  <string id="6101835">Pol, no!</string>
  <string id="6101838">We have to catch him. Hurry!</string>
  <string id="6101863">Father...</string>
  <string id="6101875">My son. I thought I'd lost you.</string>
  <string id="6101878">Enough, Father.</string>
  <string id="6101941">Should you ever have need of me, I will be here. If Danarius wishes his mansion back, he is free to return and claim it.</string>
  <string id="6101944">Beyond that, I am at your disposal.</string>
  <string id="6101948">No one has left the mansion, but I've heard nothing within.</string>
  <string id="6101951">Danarius may know we're here. I wouldn't put it past him.</string>
  <string id="6101952">I could stand to know a little more about this Danarius.</string>
  <string id="6101953">Who is this man?</string>
  <string id="6101954">He is a magister of the Tevinter Imperium.</string>
  <string id="6101957">There, he is a wealthy mage with great influence. Here, he is but a man who sweats like any other when death comes for him.</string>
  <string id="6101958">We shouldn't wait any longer, then.</string>
  <string id="6101959">Let's go in.</string>
  <string id="6101960">Agreed.</string>
  <string id="6101961">He may have prepared some magical defenses.</string>
  <string id="6101962">We should be careful.</string>
  <string id="6101963">They will not keep me from him.</string>
  <string id="6101964">What's the worst that could happen?</string>
  <string id="6101965">Nothing like a prepared mage.</string>
  <string id="6101966">I do not fear death. That does not mean we should be reckless.</string>
  <string id="6101971">Saemus, what course did you leave me? Running off, consorting, knowing full well how it looked!</string>
  <string id="6101974">You know nothing of the Qunari, and nothing of me. To the Blight with you!</string>
  <string id="6101979">Saved me camping on your doorstep. After what we went through to get here...</string>
  <string id="6101992">Fenris's Mansion</string>
  <string id="6101996">This is clearly not my affair.</string>
  <string id="6102004">Fenris's Mansion</string>
  <string id="6102009">Fenris's Mansion</string>
  <string id="6102013">Your actions are appreciated. The seneschal will see you out.</string>
  <string id="6102017">Fenris's Mansion</string>
  <string id="6102018">Fenris's Mansion</string>
  <string id="6102067">Your thugs killed Ashaad for no reason, Father! He was no brute to be slaughtered!</string>
  <string id="6102076">Well... you're no child, but I take care of my friends.</string>
  <string id="6102079">The places they have me patrolling, I've got time.</string>
  <string id="6102099">Chandan!</string>
  <string id="6102100">Why did this happen?</string>
  <string id="6102101">Radha... </string>
  <string id="6102102">We should give their clan amulets to the Keeper. Their families should know that they died bravely.</string>
  <string id="6102111">Pol... maybe it's not too late!</string>
  <string id="6102117">You can help him, can't you, Anders? You can heal anyone!</string>
  <string id="6102118">Hawke, you can save him, can't you?</string>
  <string id="6102121">Merrill... he's gone.</string>
  <string id="6102124">There's nothing left of him.</string>
  <string id="6102125">I'm sorry, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6102126">I would if I could.</string>
  <string id="6102127">Maybe we can get him to the Keeper! She can heal almost anything...</string>
  <string id="6102138">Why did you run? You shouldn't have run!</string>
  <string id="6102139">Do you need a minute alone?</string>
  <string id="6102140">Do you want some time?</string>
  <string id="6102141">Pol brought this on himself. He was a coward.</string>
  <string id="6102142">Don't waste your tears.</string>
  <string id="6102143">There was nothing you could have done.</string>
  <string id="6102144">Don't blame yourself.</string>
  <string id="6102145">What did you do to scare this man to death?</string>
  <string id="6102146">Why did he run?</string>
  <string id="6102147">No. Thank you. I... we have too much to do for me to sit here, bawling.</string>
  <string id="6102150">He wasn't! You of all people should understand the courage it takes to leave the world you know behind!</string>
  <string id="6102153">He was more afraid of me than the varterral...</string>
  <string id="6102156">Creators... I don't know.</string>
  <string id="6102159">Pol wasn't like the others. He was city-born. Worldly. He ran away from Denerim and found us.</string>
  <string id="6102162">I thought if anyone would understand, he would. This... something is very wrong. I want to see the Keeper.</string>
  <string id="6102179">See for yourself.</string>
  <string id="6102186">I've got something for you, Varric.</string>
  <string id="6102187">Set On the Loose Done</string>
  <string id="6102188">Set On the Loose Done</string>
  <string id="6102189">Return to Start</string>
  <string id="6102190">Return to Start</string>
  <string id="6102325">That has to be the vault.</string>
  <string id="6102328">If there's anything to learn about the family, that's where it is.</string>
  <string id="6102332">That's the Amell crest, I think. Mother described it once.</string>
  <string id="6102335">Put that above your door and you better have the ties to back it up. Otherwise, you just look old.</string>
  <string id="6102339">Well, this looks like the place. If the cellars go this far, maybe we were important.</string>
  <string id="6102343">The estate better be worth the trouble.</string>
  <string id="6102346">How good could it be? Mother wasn't in a hurry to come back before the darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6102403">My father's signet ring? Where did you find it? Bartrand pawned it off to pay for the expedition.</string>
  <string id="6102409">So, what? Are you here to gloat?</string>
  <string id="6102412">Gamlen's the idiot again. Gamlen's the fool who can't hold his money when it's given in a bloody silver basket.</string>
  <string id="6102415">I tried, you know? When Leandra left? But no one was ever going to live up to her.</string>
  <string id="6102416">What was she like? As a girl?</string>
  <string id="6102417">Tell me about Mother.</string>
  <string id="6102418">I've seen the nobles in this town. Your parents must have had a fortune. Where did it all go?</string>
  <string id="6102419">How did you lose the money?</string>
  <string id="6102420">I'm sure you did your best.</string>
  <string id="6102421">Everyone makes mistakes.</string>
  <string id="6102454">You know what they say about men like that, don't you?</string>
  <string id="6102455">I haven't seen any shackles. You're just making things up.</string>
  <string id="6102456">He doesn't have shackles.</string>
  <string id="6102457">Oh. But... I had this joke lined up.</string>
  <string id="6102460">You're no fun.</string>
  <string id="6102485">Cheating?</string>
  <string id="6102488">Hey, I gave her back her things. You saw me.</string>
  <string id="6102519">We're only a year apart. But that was time enough for Leandra to get our parents wrapped firmly around her little finger.</string>
  <string id="6102522">They showed her off at every opportunity—the beauty, the scholar, the light of their lives.</string>
  <string id="6102525">As far as they were concerned, they should have stopped there.</string>
  <string id="6102526">This was a bid for attention?</string>
  <string id="6102527">Well, it's not like I stood at the side of the wharf and hurled it over.</string>
  <string id="6102530">I tried to invest it. Got some good tips on trade in Qunari cheeses.</string>
  <string id="6102533">And, you know, a man's got needs. I'm not denying I spent more on myself than I should've. But I figured it'd all work out.</string>
  <string id="6102534">So the best way to make Daddy love you was to steal his money?</string>
  <string id="6102535">You tried? Really?</string>
  <string id="6102536">Don't make excuses.</string>
  <string id="6102537">You're pathetic.</string>
  <string id="6102540">Maker, what a mess. I want to make things better for Mother, but some of what Gamlen says... I'm having a hard time hating him.</string>
  <string id="6102543">Playing caretaker for someone else's life, stuck in their shadow... that's no way to live.</string>
  <string id="6102546">Here we go again.</string>
  <string id="6102549">Something you need to say?</string>
  <string id="6102552">And there it is.</string>
  <string id="6102555">Look, if you want to join the fight over who lost the most, fine. But I never lived here.</string>
  <string id="6102558">Mother even gave me her old key to try and stir something. But I didn't know Grandfather. Finding his will doesn't matter to me.</string>
  <string id="6102567">Uncle's a chatty drunk. He was up to his neck and signed everything over. That's who has the estate.</string>
  <string id="6102568">You want a connection, this is where we'll find it.</string>
  <string id="6102569">Let's make it matter to you.</string>
  <string id="6102570">The once mighty Amells? A bunch of slavers are squatting on that dusty glory.</string>
  <string id="6102573">What have you heard?</string>
  <string id="6102579">Apparently the most extensive wine cellar in Kirkwall is now a slave highway from the Undercity. That's the family legacy.</string>
  <string id="6102580">She tried her best to give us what we need. I think she's due the same.</string>
  <string id="6102581">We owe it to Mother to try.</string>
  <string id="6102582">Oh, I see her side: Gamlen's definitely an ass. But it's not like we can just ask slavers to give back that life.</string>
  <string id="6102657">That sounds like an arrangement that needs to change.</string>
  <string id="6102658">Well, that can't continue.</string>
  <string id="6102659">And what if it does? We still aren't important enough to actually live in the place.</string>
  <string id="6102660">I don't know about you, but that makes me a little angry.</string>
  <string id="6102661">No one will miss slavers.</string>
  <string id="6102662">I think we need to pay them a visit and look for Mother's missing paperwork.</string>
  <string id="6102663">The will could still be there.</string>
  <string id="6102667">We agree at last.</string>
  <string id="6102670">So forgetting everything else, what would you do with slavers?</string>
  <string id="6102673">Only one thing their kind deserves.</string>
  <string id="6102676">We agree at last.</string>
  <string id="6102679">All right, Sister. If the key works, we'll clear the estate from the Undercity up.</string>
  <string id="6102688">I don't know if any of this will help, but I do feel like hitting someone.</string>
  <string id="6102691">I'm sure they will be right neighborly about letting us poke around.</string>
  <string id="6102694">We'll give them the chance, sure.</string>
  <string id="6102697">Baby steps, Carver.</string>
  <string id="6102704">Your mother's busy writing to the viscount. If you want more touching family stories, go to her.</string>
  <string id="6102705">Don't butter me up, sweetie.</string>
  <string id="6102708">Don't try to butter me up, lad.</string>
  <string id="6102711">I changed their filthy sheets and wiped their chins through two bouts of the cholera and the last word Father said was Leandra.</string>
  <string id="6102714">I'm not looking for love. </string>
  <string id="6102717">But at least I got the money.</string>
  <string id="6102726">Incriminating Documents</string>
  <string id="6102728">An Errant Letter</string>
  <string id="6102729">Take the letter that was recovered from the transformed mage to the templar, Thrask, in the Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6102730">Thrask received the letter about his daughter being an abomination. This letter proved quite useful in blackmailing the templar.</string>
  <string id="6102731">Thrask received the letter about his daughter being an abomination. To his relief, this information will remain undisclosed.</string>
  <string id="6102732">All right, Brother. If the key works, we'll clear the estate from the Undercity up.</string>
  <string id="6102755">What's this about, Hawke?</string>
  <string id="6102756">I can't believe you found it! This sounds exactly like the sort of fake thing I'd make up about you.</string>
  <string id="6102760">Go away! I don't want to talk.</string>
  <string id="6102761">Th-this bite... it's festering. I can feel it rot.</string>
  <string id="6102762">Why would the Maker create so many darkspawn?</string>
  <string id="6102763">Well, off we go, I guess. Maker watch over us.</string>
  <string id="6102764">I would've come if you asked, but thank you for letting me stay here.</string>
  <string id="6102767">I could live happily without ever seeing a darkspawn again.</string>
  <string id="6102768">I guess you're leaving for the Deep Roads soon.</string>
  <string id="6102771">Be careful. I don't want to lose you like we lost Carver.</string>
  <string id="6102772">What do you think that Seeker wanted? I didn't get the feeling she was done here.</string>
  <string id="6102773">The people we're meeting... I'm not sure who's worse, the apostates or the templars.</string>
  <string id="6102776">I wish I didn't need either of them.</string>
  <string id="6102777">I wonder if Mother has received an audience with the viscount yet.</string>
  <string id="6102783">We're not running away again. We're coming home.</string>
  <string id="6102788">It almost looks like my new ship! I know a perfect spot for it in the captain's cabins.</string>
  <string id="6102791">This belongs to whoever is responsible for House Tethras. That's you now.</string>
  <string id="6102792">It's a reminder.</string>
  <string id="6102793">I figured you'd want it. It's an heirloom of your family's, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6102794">It belongs to your House.</string>
  <string id="6102795">I'm sure you need a seal, what with all the guild paperwork you do now.</string>
  <string id="6102796">I figured you'd need it.</string>
  <string id="6102797">It was already yours. I'm just returning it to you.</string>
  <string id="6102798">It's nothing.</string>
  <string id="6102799">I'm just glad I found it.</string>
  <string id="6102800">You're welcome.</string>
  <string id="6102801">When you tell people, mention that I got it from the belly of a dragon.</string>
  <string id="6102802">Feel free to embellish this.</string>
  <string id="6102806">You! This is all your fault!</string>
  <string id="6102809">You and that blighter, Varric Tethras!</string>
  <string id="6102810">I don't even know who you are.</string>
  <string id="6102811">Have we met?</string>
  <string id="6102812">Yevhen. Member in good standing of the Dwarven Merchants Guild.</string>
  <string id="6102813">Whatever you think I did, I can fix it.</string>
  <string id="6102814">I can help you.</string>
  <string id="6102815">Keep on insulting me and my friends, and you'll lose that wagging tongue, little man.</string>
  <string id="6102816">Shut your mouth.</string>
  <string id="6102817">Typical. Exactly the boneheaded bravado they're drawn to.</string>
  <string id="6102820">You'll have to be more specific. A lot of things are my fault.</string>
  <string id="6102821">Please clarify.</string>
  <string id="6102825">My sons are lost in the Deep Roads because of stories about you! Your sodding glory and treasure!</string>
  <string id="6102829">Your sons made an expedition into the Deep Roads? Did anyone go with them?</string>
  <string id="6102830">Tell me what happened.</string>
  <string id="6102831">They went alone, the fools. Just my three boys against every darkspawn in the Deep Roads.</string>
  <string id="6102871">I found this when we were at the estate. I thought you should have it.</string>
  <string id="6102874">I think this is a picture of Mother. She looks like you.</string>
  <string id="6102877">I don't care much about old family stuff. But I thought you might want this.</string>
  <string id="6102880">Where did you get that? Was it at the estate? Let me see!</string>
  <string id="6102883">Is it— I think this is Mother's betrothal portrait, from when she was supposed to marry the Comte. Look! You can see the ring.</string>
  <string id="6102884">You like it?</string>
  <string id="6102885">You seem excited.</string>
  <string id="6102886">I love it!</string>
  <string id="6102889">My whole life, Mother's always been so sad and worried. All because of my cursed magic.</string>
  <string id="6102892">I always wished there was some way to take that burden off her.</string>
  <string id="6102895">I suppose it would have been a bit awkward to take it with her.</string>
  <string id="6102896">No wonder she left it behind.</string>
  <string id="6102897">She was much happier with Father.</string>
  <string id="6102898">Father was a better man.</string>
  <string id="6102899">I know she loved Father. I guess... I just wonder if she'd have been happier if he hadn't been a mage. If I wasn't a mage.</string>
  <string id="6102902">I know that made it hard for Mother.</string>
  <string id="6102905">It's nice to have a reminder of a time when she still knew how to smile.</string>
  <string id="6102908">What about the other one? Merin?</string>
  <string id="6102909">Tell me about Merin.</string>
  <string id="6102910">Sounds like you're none too fond of Iwan, Dera.</string>
  <string id="6102911">Tell me about Iwan.</string>
  <string id="6102912">Chasing Isabela</string>
  <string id="6102913">Hello, Lord Carver.</string>
  <string id="6102916">We're still a long way from cowing templars with our titles, Brother.</string>
  <string id="6102919">We're still a long way from cowing templars with our titles, Sister.</string>
  <string id="6102923">Follow Isabela's trail.</string>
  <string id="6102924">Follow Isabela's trail to Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6102925">Follow Isabela's trail to the Docks.</string>
  <string id="6102926">Why don't you go pick up something at the market? You could use some air!</string>
  <string id="6102929">What? Hey!</string>
  <string id="6102938">Still brooding? You're nobility. Knock it off.</string>
  <string id="6102941">Thinking of life in Hightown?</string>
  <string id="6102947">Is there something you would do differently, Brother?</string>
  <string id="6102948">Not happy with our progress?</string>
  <string id="6102949">You could slap on a smile for a few days. For her sake.</string>
  <string id="6102950">Be happy for Mother.</string>
  <string id="6102951">We took a big step with this. You should respect that.</string>
  <string id="6102952">Your attitude stinks.</string>
  <string id="6102953">Don't you dare blame her! We both know this was Iwan's doing!</string>
  <string id="6102954">Don't you dare blame him! We both know this was Iwan's doing!</string>
  <string id="6103008">You figured it'd work out?</string>
  <string id="6103009">Rescue Isabela from the warehouse.</string>
  <string id="6103010">It's not up to me. We're on pace to recover an old name for an old woman.</string>
  <string id="6103012">She's not interested in what I think. She wants to provide for us, and you're making sure it happens.</string>
  <string id="6103018">He's always been such a greedy thing. Even as a boy.</string>
  <string id="6103021">Stop talking about my son like that!</string>
  <string id="6103022">Tell me about Emrys.</string>
  <string id="6103023">What is Emrys like?</string>
  <string id="6103024">Iwan is Yevhen's middle son. The whole thing was his idea. Emrys and Merin were just following his lead.</string>
  <string id="6103034">It's strange, living here again. My childhood home, now owned by my child.</string>
  <string id="6103037">It's not something I could have imagined when I was a little girl staring out this window.</string>
  <string id="6103040">I'm still grateful you used your money from the expedition to buy back the estate. I feel like an Amell again.</string>
  <string id="6103041">I'm going to make the name Hawke one to be proud of in this city.</string>
  <string id="6103042">You're a Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6103043">I don't doubt it. Your father would have said that with that exact look, too.</string>
  <string id="6103046">I just wish we could all be together as a family one more time.</string>
  <string id="6103049">Just don't go all pompous on me, all right?</string>
  <string id="6103050">Don't start putting on airs.</string>
  <string id="6103051">I promise. If there's one thing I learned in Ferelden, it's that good people can be born in a hut as easily as a palace.</string>
  <string id="6103054">Honestly, after so many years as a peasant's wife, it feels strange to have nothing to do.</string>
  <string id="6103057">But I can't spend the rest of my life mourning Bethany and Carver. They're gone and I can't bring them back.</string>
  <string id="6103060">It's been three years. Move on already.</string>
  <string id="6103061">Not this again...</string>
  <string id="6103062">You have so many new duties to keep you busy. And I'm just sitting idle.</string>
  <string id="6103065">But I am doing better.</string>
  <string id="6103068">I visited Bethany at the Circle and she seems happy enough.</string>
  <string id="6103071">I visited Carver with the templars and he's so proud of his new knighthood.</string>
  <string id="6103074">I just... to lose Bethany and Carver, both of them, so close together. It's been hard. But I'm trying.</string>
  <string id="6103077">I guess I just need to start finding you a suitable wife.</string>
  <string id="6103078">I guess I just need to start picking you out a suitable husband.</string>
  <string id="6103085">... and then Hawke tore the door clean off its hinges, walked into the room, and... I guess we'll finish this later.</string>
  <string id="6103097">Right, right, the glorious Amells, a noble lineage dating to the Third Blight. You know what that means?</string>
  <string id="6103100">Seven hundred years of people sitting around saying, wow, look how great we used to be.</string>
  <string id="6103103">Mother didn't even want that life back until we got dumped here. And you only care because we're under templar scrutiny.</string>
  <string id="6103110">If you want to keep your job, shut your mouth, woman!</string>
  <string id="6103113">Your boys are grown men. It was their own decision!</string>
  <string id="6103114">What exactly were they trying to do?</string>
  <string id="6103115">That requires an explanation.</string>
  <string id="6103118">Sounds familiar.</string>
  <string id="6103123">The Reinhardts' second daughter is very interested in meeting you.</string>
  <string id="6103124">Seneschal Bran has a son about your age...</string>
  <string id="6103128">He's the oldest, but Iwan's been bossing him around since he learned to talk. Man's near thirty and has no backbone whatsoever.</string>
  <string id="6103131">His mother's death hit him hard, but he shouldn't be looking to his brothers for guidance.</string>
  <string id="6103134">Merin's a dear sweet lad. Raised him myself since the day his mum died.</string>
  <string id="6103138">Isabela's Trail</string>
  <string id="6103170">They will know. Whether they will deign to acknowledge it, I have no idea.</string>
  <string id="6103193">They never learn, do they?</string>
  <string id="6103194">I fail to see the point of throwing their lives away.</string>
  <string id="6103195">Another twenty steps, another batch of deaths.</string>
  <string id="6103196">What a waste.</string>
  <string id="6103197">We have important things to do. Why do they insist on interrupting?</string>
  <string id="6103201">You're apparently quite the inspiration.</string>
  <string id="6103202">Hard to teach some people.</string>
  <string id="6103203">Is there an end to the people who hate you?</string>
  <string id="6103204">They certainly don't leave us much choice.</string>
  <string id="6103205">I hate that people like that make this necessary.</string>
  <string id="6103209">I don't know if I like being this much of a target.</string>
  <string id="6103210">I guess some people just can't let the past go.</string>
  <string id="6103211">Senseless. Every time.</string>
  <string id="6103212">What was the point of throwing away their lives like that?</string>
  <string id="6103213">And stay dead! Maker, the idiocy.</string>
  <string id="6103217">It'll take a census to tally the dead when we're done.</string>
  <string id="6103218">Take a step, kill. Repeat, repeat, repeat.</string>
  <string id="6103219">Should have licked their wounds and stayed home.</string>
  <string id="6103220">How many times does this happen before people start to realize it's not a good idea?</string>
  <string id="6103221">That's what you get. Right there: dead.</string>
  <string id="6103225">The hate you inspire is unfortunate.</string>
  <string id="6103226">So many enemies. Do they ever rest?</string>
  <string id="6103227">How many times do we have to do this before people learn?</string>
  <string id="6103228">More? I thought we were pretty thorough the first time around.</string>
  <string id="6103229">A pointless way to end their lives.</string>
  <string id="6103233">Your death toll is approaching natural disaster.</string>
  <string id="6103234">Can you imagine how sore you'd be if it was your job to bury all these idiots?</string>
  <string id="6103235">Who keeps hiring these discount thugs? Quality investments pay off, people.</string>
  <string id="6103236">These little surprises are getting old.</string>
  <string id="6103237">We had a short-lived drinking game based how many enemies you have. It killed a man.</string>
  <string id="6103241">Nobody seems to like you. Do you get used to that?</string>
  <string id="6103242">That was just sad. People need to let go. At least sometimes.</string>
  <string id="6103243">How long does this go on? Someone has to know this is pointless.</string>
  <string id="6103244">Is it normal for people to come back like this? I don't know what's normal.</string>
  <string id="6103245">It's unfortunate that they make this necessary.</string>
  <string id="6103249">I'll just call that bunch enemies and footnote it later.</string>
  <string id="6103250">More? You're not exactly the most popular person in town.</string>
  <string id="6103251">I didn't even get their names that time.</string>
  <string id="6103252">How many people do you have on your tail?</string>
  <string id="6103253">I'm getting too old for this shit.</string>
  <string id="6103265">Hawke, about Junior... Maker, I'm sorry. Bartrand will pay for this, I swear.</string>
  <string id="6103266">Poor Sunshine... Bartrand will pay for her death, I promise you.</string>
  <string id="6103269">And when we're done, I don't know. I guess we'll sit around thinking about how great we used to be?</string>
  <string id="6103288"> I thought coming to the surface meant I would never have to face losing my sons to the darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6103289">Hopefully we can save your sons before their idiocy gets them killed.</string>
  <string id="6103290">I'll do it.</string>
  <string id="6103294">I'm not risking the Deep Roads for your foolish children.</string>
  <string id="6103295">I can't help you.</string>
  <string id="6103302">They murdered my friend! Where is the concern for that?</string>
  <string id="6103305">You have my gratitude. I hope you encountered no great difficulties on my son's behalf.</string>
  <string id="6103306">There were complications, but I was privileged to keep your son from harm.</string>
  <string id="6103307">It was my honor.</string>
  <string id="6103308">No problems to speak of, aside from the crowd that tried to kill us.</string>
  <string id="6103309">Just a few dozen deaths.</string>
  <string id="6103310">We were heavily outnumbered, but I prevailed.</string>
  <string id="6103311">We survived.</string>
  <string id="6103319">I am yours.</string>
  <string id="6103320">Tell me, and it is done.</string>
  <string id="6103321">I enjoy following you.</string>
  <string id="6103322">Always a pleasure.</string>
  <string id="6103323">I remain at your side.</string>
  <string id="6103326">Yes, my friend?</string>
  <string id="6103327">Whatever you need, I am ready to assist.</string>
  <string id="6103330">What is it?</string>
  <string id="6103331">I stand ready.</string>
  <string id="6103332">Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6103336">I cannot imagine what it must be like to lose your family.</string>
  <string id="6103339">Anything I could say would be insufficient. I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6103340">I would not wish your sister's end on anyone. Accept my condolences.</string>
  <string id="6103341">Your brother seemed a fine young man. I am sorry for his loss.</string>
  <string id="6103344">The mansion would be a better place to talk.</string>
  <string id="6103345">I'd like to speak with you, but not here. My mansion is more appropriate.</string>
  <string id="6103346">We can talk at the mansion, if you like.</string>
  <string id="6103349">We can talk more back at the city.</string>
  <string id="6103350">Now is not the time to chat. Perhaps back in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6103351">I would be glad to speak with you, but not here.</string>
  <string id="6103352">I am rather conspicuous here.</string>
  <string id="6103353">The trappings change, but power here is the same as power anywhere.</string>
  <string id="6103354">They will not want me in this place. Let us not linger.</string>
  <string id="6103355">Sour ale, vomit, and the smell of desperation.</string>
  <string id="6103356">Slavery or no, flesh is always for sale.</string>
  <string id="6103357">I didn't think this city could smell any worse. Evidently I was wrong.</string>
  <string id="6103358">This place is known, even in Tevinter.</string>
  <string id="6103359">Many slaves died here. Their cries linger in the stones.</string>
  <string id="6103360">The Wounded Coast? Appropriate.</string>
  <string id="6103363">Sure, I'll look. How many darkspawn could have come back in three years, anyway?</string>
  <string id="6103364">I'll do it.</string>
  <string id="6103368">I'll do everything in my power to bring your sons home.</string>
  <string id="6103369">I'll do it.</string>
  <string id="6103370">Thank you, messere. Those boys are my life.</string>
  <string id="6103373">No, thanks. The Deep Roads and I don't get along.</string>
  <string id="6103374">I can't help you.</string>
  <string id="6103381">I'm sorry, but your sons chose this risk. You must trust they can make it out themselves.</string>
  <string id="6103382">I can't help you.</string>
  <string id="6103383">Then you condemn my sons to death.</string>
  <string id="6103386">Please, messere! It was your trail they followed. If you change your mind, there may still be time to find them.</string>
  <string id="6103390">The second child act is getting pretty stale, Brother.</string>
  <string id="6103391">No one is holding you back.</string>
  <string id="6103392">Very well, Carver. What's your plan?</string>
  <string id="6103393">Fine. What would you do?</string>
  <string id="6103394">I'd look forward, make something new. Stop paying debts for old men.</string>
  <string id="6103397">And if I had to go backward, I'm not looking for ancient names. I'd fix what's important. What went wrong.</string>
  <string id="6103400">We wouldn't need to if you'd done it right. Lothering was our home, not this place. We could have stood our ground.</string>
  <string id="6103403">You could have stopped that ogre from killing Bethany.</string>
  <string id="6103404">You own as much of that as I do!</string>
  <string id="6103405">You share the blame for that!</string>
  <string id="6103408">You're right.</string>
  <string id="6103409">I agree.</string>
  <string id="6103410">You hating everything I do is really losing its charm.</string>
  <string id="6103411">You're being an ass.</string>
  <string id="6103412">I was told the Winters had involved themselves. Was there no way to avoid an incident?</string>
  <string id="6103424">2a) The Talvashoth Cave</string>
  <string id="6103425">2a) The Talvashoth Cave</string>
  <string id="6103435">Why don't we go to the tavern and get a drink? We should chat.</string>
  <string id="6103450">Let's head to the Hanged Man. We should talk, and I'd rather do it where I know who's spying on us.</string>
  <string id="6103451">When we get back to Kirkwall, let's stop by the Hanged Man.</string>
  <string id="6103458">I haven't met that many Dalish, and already I'm not crazy about them.</string>
  <string id="6103461">Something about this whole... creepy ancient magic thing makes me nervous.</string>
  <string id="6103464">Oh hey, nature. I've heard about this. Thought it was just a rumor.</string>
  <string id="6103495">This outdoors thing is growing on me. Like a tumor.</string>
  <string id="6103555">I am getting truly sick of looking at stalagmites. Or are they stalactites? Shit, I don't know.</string>
  <string id="6103556">Andraste's ass, dwarves actually live down here? On purpose? What in blazes for?</string>
  <string id="6103557">I will not be sorry to see daylight again.</string>
  <string id="6103560">Just like always, no cause is too small for you to stick your nose in. I have this under control.</string>
  <string id="6103562">Nothing's changed between us after all these years?</string>
  <string id="6103563">Still angry, Carver?</string>
  <string id="6103564">I've seen a lot, Brother. Our little squabble, it doesn't matter.</string>
  <string id="6103567">Your tone says otherwise, Warden.</string>
  <string id="6103570">It's been years, Carver. We can't be civil?</string>
  <string id="6103571">I'm glad you're doing well.</string>
  <string id="6103572">I almost died in your shadow. I don't appreciate you showing up to take my thunder.</string>
  <string id="6103575">You know, the average person saves a life, they might expect some gratitude.</string>
  <string id="6103576">A little thanks, maybe?</string>
  <string id="6103577">I've seen too much of the world to be impressed by this.</string>
  <string id="6103580">It's just kind of sad.</string>
  <string id="6103583">What is?</string>
  <string id="6103586">That your world has stayed so small.</string>
  <string id="6103592">If my shadow made it down here, you brought it.</string>
  <string id="6103595">I'm a Warden because of you. I blamed you for a long time, but... you saved more than my life. I am so much more than I was.</string>
  <string id="6103598">This is what I was meant to be, and I won't thank you by doing nothing while you start a war.</string>
  <string id="6103599">And Mother said I was the stubborn one.</string>
  <string id="6103603">In war, victory, Champion. Wherever you're bound.</string>
  <string id="6103607">I never claimed to be head of the family.</string>
  <string id="6103610">Neither did I, but someone had to save your ass!</string>
  <string id="6103616">All right.</string>
  <string id="6103625">I'm here if you need me, but I must find my own way.</string>
  <string id="6103627">Try it from this side, always running after you. Or taking care of Mother while you mark your territory.</string>
  <string id="6103628">What?</string>
  <string id="6103631">I'd change all of that if I could. But we don't have that option. And you know it.</string>
  <string id="6103640">You will not use her against me like that! She deserves better!</string>
  <string id="6103641">Not another word!</string>
  <string id="6103642">Then you should have given better.</string>
  <string id="6103645">I gave everything! Question me, Mother, yourself, but not that!</string>
  <string id="6103648">Feel better getting that off your chest?</string>
  <string id="6103649">Are you done?</string>
  <string id="6103650">I... I suppose.</string>
  <string id="6103653">Good. Because I keep every death with me. If you want that weight, be sure you're ready to take it.</string>
  <string id="6103657">I think we're done.</string>
  <string id="6103662">Well, good talk.</string>
  <string id="6103665">I'd rather not talk with so many people around. Maybe back at my place... such as it is?</string>
  <string id="6103666">This isn't a good place to talk. When you can, let's go to my clinic.</string>
  <string id="6103667">Not now. What I have to say requires privacy. Perhaps back at my clinic.</string>
  <string id="6103668">My words are for your ears only. Speak to me in my clinic.</string>
  <string id="6103669">I would like to talk. But not here. When you have time, let's return to my clinic.</string>
  <string id="6103670">Please. Let's not get into anything here. We can talk in private at my clinic.</string>
  <string id="6103671">I've been thinking, and we have much to discuss. But only where no other ears are listening.</string>
  <string id="6103674">This isn't the place for conversation. We can talk back in the city.</string>
  <string id="6103675">It's too dangerous here to stop and chat. Wait until we're in the city.</string>
  <string id="6103676">We must stay alert out here. We can talk in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6103677">Let's not lose our focus. We can talk back in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6103678">This isn't the place for a long heart-to-heart. Let's get back to civilization.</string>
  <string id="6103679">We have more important things to do than chat. Wait until we're back in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6103680">Sure, make light. Why take anything seriously? You're the eldest, you lead by default. </string>
  <string id="6103683">I don't see you taking the reins.</string>
  <string id="6103686">Besides, we both know what happens when someone leaves dear brother's protection.</string>
  <string id="6103689">I'm sure Bethany would appreciate that you're keeping good humor.</string>
  <string id="6103691">Fun's fun, but you're taking this little pissing match too far.</string>
  <string id="6103692">Not amusing.</string>
  <string id="6103693">Poor you. Too busy hiding in my shadow to escape from it.</string>
  <string id="6103694">You give me a lot to laugh at.</string>
  <string id="6103699">What, you don't like someone making a joke out of everything you are?</string>
  <string id="6103713">I am not a joke!</string>
  <string id="6103716">No, you're a lazy brat with a chip on your shoulder!</string>
  <string id="6103721">He's the one who liked the stories best. He wanted to be a hero, though, not just rich. He craved adventure.</string>
  <string id="6103724">Adventure will get a dwarf killed. That boy needs to settle down and learn a trade. Play it safe.</string>
  <string id="6103731">I don't like the idea of some templar Seeker tracking you. Be cautious.</string>
  <string id="6103732">I get so furious when mages try to oppose templars by turning to demons.</string>
  <string id="6103735">There is no better way to ensure we will never be free.</string>
  <string id="6103739">I can't believe you sent that boy Feynriel to the Circle. You know what will become of him there.</string>
  <string id="6103740">You showed the boy Feynriel great mercy. He will live better among the Dalish than anywhere in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6103741">That Thrask seemed like a decent man. For a templar.</string>
  <string id="6103742">I am so sorry about your sister. She seemed a fine girl. She deserved a better end.</string>
  <string id="6103743">I'm sorry about your brother. He was a bit prickly, but he would have grown into a fine man. He deserved better.</string>
  <string id="6103744">Your sister will come to terms with the Wardens.</string>
  <string id="6103747">If she survived the Joining, she has the strength to do all they will ask of her.</string>
  <string id="6103748">I think your brother will like the Wardens. He'll get to be rude and be a hero.</string>
  <string id="6103751">From what I saw of him, I suspect he'll enjoy both.</string>
  <string id="6103756">Your mother... I'm so sorry. I can't believe any mage would do such a thing.</string>
  <string id="6103757">I have tried to avoid the Fade since Justice... It's disturbing when he takes over.</string>
  <string id="6103781">It is still a thrill to turn and see you beside me.</string>
  <string id="6103782">Don't start needling me now. We're busy.</string>
  <string id="6103783">I miss my cat.</string>
  <string id="6103784">When should I do that? When I'm following you around, or when I'm caring for Mother while you tame mighty Kirkwall?</string>
  <string id="6103787">Besides, we both know what happens when someone leaves dear sister's protection.</string>
  <string id="6103796">What do you want to do?</string>
  <string id="6103797">Area Jump</string>
  <string id="6103798">Area Jump</string>
  <string id="6103799">Jump to where?</string>
  <string id="6103800">Warehouse</string>
  <string id="6103801">Warehouse</string>
  <string id="6103802">Go Back</string>
  <string id="6103803">Go Back</string>
  <string id="6103804">Jump to Plot Point</string>
  <string id="6103805">Jump to Plot Point</string>
  <string id="6103806">Where in the plot?</string>
  <string id="6103807">Betrayal Talk</string>
  <string id="6103808">Betrayal Talk</string>
  <string id="6103809">Quest Start</string>
  <string id="6103810">Quest Start</string>
  <string id="6103811">First Velasco Encounter</string>
  <string id="6103812">First Velasco Encounter</string>
  <string id="6103813">Last Encounter (Warehouse)</string>
  <string id="6103814">Last Encounter (Warehouse)</string>
  <string id="6103822">I thought you might like this.</string>
  <string id="6103825">I don't see the humor in digging up Bethany so you can hide behind her, too.</string>
  <string id="6103839">Please help me find them. Don't let my boys die down there.</string>
  <string id="6103844">That's enough, Carver.</string>
  <string id="6103887">I'm with you, Brother. For now.</string>
  <string id="6103888">I'm with you, Sister. For now.</string>
  <string id="6103897">I brought you something. It's shiny and subversive. I thought you'd like it.</string>
  <string id="6103900">I found something. You're more likely to make use of it than me.</string>
  <string id="6103903">You got me a gift? I hardly think I've done anything to deserve that.</string>
  <string id="6103906">I don't understand. You got me a gift? Is there some... Free Marches holiday I'm not aware of?</string>
  <string id="6103909">Is it a... that's a Tevinter Chantry amulet! Do you want me to get executed?</string>
  <string id="6103912">It's sacrilege to wear those in any land under the Divine.</string>
  <string id="6103913">The Divine condemned their chantry because it freed mages from the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6103914">The Tevinters freed mages.</string>
  <string id="6103915">I thought you might sympathize.</string>
  <string id="6103918">Here I thought you fight for mages' rights, whoever's bad side that puts you on.</string>
  <string id="6103919">Are you afraid of sacrilege?</string>
  <string id="6103920">It's a symbol of mage freedom. If you don't like it, don't take it.</string>
  <string id="6103921">Do you want it or not?</string>
  <string id="6103922">No. I like it. You just... surprised me. I wouldn't know where to get something like that around here.</string>
  <string id="6103925">Maker... I think he's ignoring me now.</string>
  <string id="6103928">Hey! Is my coin not good enough for you?</string>
  <string id="6103942">Here, I got you something.</string>
  <string id="6103945">Why?</string>
  <string id="6103946">Don't give me that look. Be grateful for five minutes.</string>
  <string id="6103947">Just read the letters.</string>
  <string id="6103953">I never have affairs with my crew. Once they see you naked with your ass in the air, they think they don't have to take orders.</string>
  <string id="6103959">I—oh, look! It's Hawke!</string>
  <string id="6103962">Isabela! My dusky goddess!</string>
  <string id="6103965">You have buried yourself in the flesh of my heart, like a worm in a red, red apple.</string>
  <string id="6103968">You heart-worm, you!</string>
  <string id="6103974">Oh, look, my friend is here. Excuse me.</string>
  <string id="6103977">But I haven't gotten to the part where I invite you to feast upon my tender white flesh!</string>
  <string id="6103980">That's all right. I think I'll manage.</string>
  <string id="6103986">Speaking of romance...</string>
  <string id="6103987">Birthright</string>
  <string id="6103988">Birthright</string>
  <string id="6103989">Office Key</string>
  <string id="6103991">Speak with Mother about her argument with Gamlen.</string>
  <string id="6103992">Find Grandfather Amell's will. Go to Darktown and break into the cellars of the old family estate.</string>
  <string id="6103993">Door</string>
  <string id="6103995">I like it. Maybe not on the outside of my clothes—I'm not that eager to face the hangman's noose—but I appreciate the thought.</string>
  <string id="6104000">I've never really thought about what life would be like in the Tevinter Chantry.</string>
  <string id="6104003">In the Circle, they make it sound like the Void itself. The Black Divine, stalking Thedas, making it unsafe for kittens and virgins.</string>
  <string id="6104004">Mages have been free in Tevinter forever. It hasn't fallen yet.</string>
  <string id="6104005">That's propaganda.</string>
  <string id="6104006">Well, they did invade the Black City in their hubris and unleash darkspawn on us all, right?</string>
  <string id="6104009">That's kind of the Circle's whole rationale. But I think that has more to do with being a magister than a mage.</string>
  <string id="6104012">Those kittens and virgins will just have to find a nice strong mage to protect them.</string>
  <string id="6104013">They'll be all right.</string>
  <string id="6104014">Laughs From what I hear about the Tevinters, that's the last thing they'd want.</string>
  <string id="6104017">The virgins, anyway. I've never heard about any horrific... kitten rituals.</string>
  <string id="6104020">I appreciate the gift. Perhaps one day I can return one as meaningful.</string>
  <string id="6104021">I don't support the Tevinter Chantry. I just thought you'd like the amulet.</string>
  <string id="6104022">I'm not trying to convert you.</string>
  <string id="6104023">Well, I do. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6104056">I will never truly feel at home as long as we are living with Gamlen.</string>
  <string id="6104063">Retrieve the will from the family vault.</string>
  <string id="6104065">Confront Gamlen with his father's will.</string>
  <string id="6104087">You saved Merin. I don't think I'll ever be able to repay you.</string>
  <string id="6104098">Oh Merin, you poor boy...</string>
  <string id="6104144">Iwan... he's not with you. I had hoped...</string>
  <string id="6104147">Father, I told you it would be too late.</string>
  <string id="6104150">He tried to kill Merin and Emrys, and you're sad he didn't make it?</string>
  <string id="6104153">His betrayal isn't lost on me, Dera. But he'll always be my son.</string>
  <string id="6104156">You've given me back two of my boys, messere. I'm in your debt. Please, take this as thanks.</string>
  <string id="6104170">Not much room in the barracks, but there's nowhere I'd rather be.</string>
  <string id="6104175">Your wife is missing? I can try to find her if you like.</string>
  <string id="6104176">Is there something I can do?</string>
  <string id="6104180">You should pay someone else. Like me. I like being paid.</string>
  <string id="6104181">Pay me instead.</string>
  <string id="6104182">I intend to claim the reward for finding your wife.</string>
  <string id="6104183">I'm interested in the bounty.</string>
  <string id="6104184">You are going to look for Ninette? Finally, someone who looks competent.</string>
  <string id="6104187">Her family is getting suspicious. They think I might have... done something to her.</string>
  <string id="6104188">Why would her family think you did something to her?</string>
  <string id="6104189">Her family is suspicious?</string>
  <string id="6104193">They think I married her for her inheritance. And they know we've been fighting.</string>
  <string id="6104197">Do you think Ninette might be in trouble?</string>
  <string id="6104198">Is Ninette in danger?</string>
  <string id="6104202">Bah. She's just trying to show me I'm tied to her purse-strings.</string>
  <string id="6104203">How long has your wife been gone?</string>
  <string id="6104204">When did you last see Ninette?</string>
  <string id="6104205">About a month. I wasn't worried at first. She's run off before.</string>
  <string id="6104208">Ninette is uncontrollable, you see. She comes and goes as she pleases.</string>
  <string id="6104218">You're more concerned what her family thinks than what happened to her?</string>
  <string id="6104219">Don't you want her back?</string>
  <string id="6104237">So you'd leave her to die just to spite me?</string>
  <string id="6104240">If you reconsider, talk to Jethann at the Blooming Rose. Yes, Ninette visited whores.</string>
  <string id="6104249">Are you one of Yevhen's sons?</string>
  <string id="6104252">Mistress Hawke? Please help me!</string>
  <string id="6104255">Master Hawke? Please help me!</string>
  <string id="6104258">My brother... Merin... Iwan locked him in with the darkspawn!</string>
  <string id="6104261">He sealed the door... left me here and bolted for that passage. He's gone mad! All he cares about is that damned sword.</string>
  <string id="6104262">Is your brother insane or just cruel?</string>
  <string id="6104263">Do you think he's truly mad?</string>
  <string id="6104273">This is getting just a little too familiar, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6104274">We should take that sword. This Iwan does not deserve it.</string>
  <string id="6104275">Maybe we should look for this sword. Sounds like you missed the best thing in here.</string>
  <string id="6104276">Please! I don't want my brother to be eaten by these monsters.</string>
  <string id="6104277">Another greedy dwarf. You think he took lessons from Bartrand?</string>
  <string id="6104278">How typical.</string>
  <string id="6104279">Wandering the Deep Roads by himself won't get him coin, it'll get him killed.</string>
  <string id="6104280">Your brother is an idiot.</string>
  <string id="6104289">We should try to save Merin. Poor lad deserves better than dying down here.</string>
  <string id="6104290">Well, Hawke? Which will it be—Merin or the sword?</string>
  <string id="6104291">We'll save your brother. Right? We're going to save him?</string>
  <string id="6104293">Go tell your father what happened. I'll do what I can for your brother.</string>
  <string id="6104294">I'll save Merin.</string>
  <string id="6104295">I'll do my best. Go back to your father, and I'll find you when I'm done.</string>
  <string id="6104296">I'll save Merin.</string>
  <string id="6104297">Get back to the surface. Looks like I have a date with the darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6104298">I'll save Merin.</string>
  <string id="6104299">He's on the other side of that wall. You need to find a way to reach him.</string>
  <string id="6104302">Forget your brother. I want that sword.</string>
  <string id="6104303">I want the weapon.</string>
  <string id="6104304">Merin is certainly dead already. I'm going to stop Iwan from getting that sword.</string>
  <string id="6104305">I want the weapon.</string>
  <string id="6104306">Sorry, but my friend Sandal would never forgive me if I left here without a new sword for him to enchant.</string>
  <string id="6104307">I want the weapon.</string>
  <string id="6104308">You're going to let Merin die for your greed? You're as bad as Iwan!</string>
  <string id="6104313">Chest</string>
  <string id="6104317">You should talk to Jethann at the Blooming Rose. </string>
  <string id="6104320">I didn't know she visited whores. Until Jethann sent a letter. To our house! He even sent her flowers once. Lilies—her favorite.</string>
  <string id="6104329">I don't care about the sword. Please! Save my brother!</string>
  <string id="6104334">Ninette is going to ruin me.</string>
  <string id="6104336">I should've married a nice Free Marcher girl.</string>
  <string id="6104337">Bah! Women are more trouble than they're worth.</string>
  <string id="6104339">I'll try my best to find Ninette and bring her home.</string>
  <string id="6104340">I can help.</string>
  <string id="6104347">Merin became suspicious... and then Iwan sealed him in. Please! You can save him, right?</string>
  <string id="6104365">Even back home, what could I be? The lone blade in a house of mages? If I excelled, it brought too much attention.</string>
  <string id="6104369">By the Stone, I thought I was done for. Wait, you... you're Master Hawke! I can't believe it's you!</string>
  <string id="6104372">You know, I never realized what the dwarves in Orzammar are up against. They fight these monsters every day of their lives.</string>
  <string id="6104375">I don't think I can sit by and let my people die while I enjoy the easy life of a merchant. Not anymore.</string>
  <string id="6104386">I had no idea the Deep Roads would be like this. That the darkspawn would just be... everywhere.</string>
  <string id="6104409">Come find us when you return. I'm sure Father will want to thank you for saving me.</string>
  <string id="6104414">That was a waste, huh? Could have found my fortune if Bethany was going to die on your watch anyway.</string>
  <string id="6104415">What're you having? Edwina! Let's get a couple of drinks here!</string>
  <string id="6104422">Today's my rest day, but I'll make an exception for you.</string>
  <string id="6104426">Jethann? Have you seen Ninette lately?</string>
  <string id="6104429">Ninette? Not for several weeks, which is a shame. I enjoy her company.</string>
  <string id="6104432">I hear she finally left her worthless husband. Good for her. I just wish she'd said goodbye.</string>
  <string id="6104433">Did she tell you she left her husband?</string>
  <string id="6104434">You think she left Ghyslain?</string>
  <string id="6104435">No, I just hope that's what she did.</string>
  <string id="6104438">Ghyslain only wants her for her family's wealth.</string>
  <string id="6104441">Ninette's a jewel. Elegant, worldly, just the perfect level of depraved. Ghyslain doesn't deserve her.</string>
  <string id="6104447">Ghyslain knew about you and Ninette. Did he talk to you?</string>
  <string id="6104448">Has Ghyslain spoken to you?</string>
  <string id="6104449">We ended on a tense note last time. Take it as you will.</string>
  <string id="6104450">A peace offering.</string>
  <string id="6104451">I'm not holding you back with generosity. Just have a look.</string>
  <string id="6104452">Don't get suspicious.</string>
  <string id="6104459">We have something to talk about, but we'll do it back at the house.</string>
  <string id="6104460">I'm not stopping to talk out here. We'll get into it back at the house in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6104536">If you have a plan, get to it.</string>
  <string id="6104537">I'm here, right behind you.</string>
  <string id="6104538">By all means, lead on.</string>
  <string id="6104545">I don't have to make shit up about you. The truth is much more entertaining. Not to mention incriminating.</string>
  <string id="6104546">The man is incapable of talking.</string>
  <string id="6104549">He came here, yelled at me, called me a dirty knife-ear—among other things—and accused me of corrupting his wife!</string>
  <string id="6104552">We had him thrown out.</string>
  <string id="6104565">Do you think Ninette has come to harm?</string>
  <string id="6104566">Could Ninette be in trouble?</string>
  <string id="6104567">I hope not! Everyone loves Ninette. Sometimes twice a night. Chuckles</string>
  <string id="6104570">Ghyslain's the only one who might hurt her. And he doesn't have the balls for it.</string>
  <string id="6104574">Do you have any idea where she might be?</string>
  <string id="6104575">Do you know anything else?</string>
  <string id="6104576">Were you hoping Ninette would leave Ghyslain for you?</string>
  <string id="6104577">You seem fond of Ninette.</string>
  <string id="6104578">So you don't actually know anything.</string>
  <string id="6104579">This was a waste of time.</string>
  <string id="6104586">Back to Gamlen's. It's not so bad when he's not here. Which is never.</string>
  <string id="6104598">What did you let them do? What did they do to me?</string>
  <string id="6104599">It's like I'm cold inside. Straight through. And I can hear... something.</string>
  <string id="6104600">Just get me down there, and I'll make sure we clean up.</string>
  <string id="6104601">Let's not waste time with more petty work. We have the money for the Deep Roads.</string>
  <string id="6104602">We're in it now. This all part of your plan?</string>
  <string id="6104603">Sure. Go. Make the family proud. I'll stay here, as ordered.</string>
  <string id="6104607">I can't see why a templar would be interested in anyone who isn't a mage.</string>
  <string id="6104613">Any chance Ninette's an apostate?</string>
  <string id="6104614">You sure she isn't a mage?</string>
  <string id="6104615">Anyway, if Ninette was a mage, I think Emeric would have said so.</string>
  <string id="6104616">Perhaps Emeric knows something we don't.</string>
  <string id="6104617">That was a great help.</string>
  <string id="6104618">Someone else Ninette spent special alone time with, perhaps?</string>
  <string id="6104619">Was Emeric Ninette's lover?</string>
  <string id="6104620">Maybe he has something useful to say.</string>
  <string id="6104621">I'll find Emeric.</string>
  <string id="6104622">Emeric said he'd continue his investigation in Darktown. You could see if he's still there.</string>
  <string id="6104625">And if you find Ninette, tell her to drop by and see me sometime.</string>
  <string id="6104708">I'm not spreading rumors. I'm just telling you which way the wind is blowing.</string>
  <string id="6104712">You're older than I thought you'd be. Ninette seems to go for the young, pointy-eared sorts.</string>
  <string id="6104713">I hear you were asking about Ninette de Carrac's whereabouts.</string>
  <string id="6104714">Just the person I was looking for. I need to speak with you about Ninette.</string>
  <string id="6104730">Doesn't the Circle use phylacteries to keep track of its mages?</string>
  <string id="6104731">Can't you track Mharen down?</string>
  <string id="6104732">We followed her phylactery to a foundry, but found nothing.</string>
  <string id="6104735">I had heard of sympathizers smuggling mages through Darktown, so came here hoping to pick up the trail.</string>
  <string id="6104738">But no trace of Mharen. And, as you've seen, asking the locals hasn't made me very popular.</string>
  <string id="6104745">People don't just disappear. Perhaps they were murdered or kidnapped.</string>
  <string id="6104746">Could they be dead?</string>
  <string id="6104753">We found no bodies, no ransom notes. Those women just vanished.</string>
  <string id="6104754">Can I assist your investigation?</string>
  <string id="6104755">Can I help at all?</string>
  <string id="6104756">Don't you hate it when something goes missing? I lose things all the time.</string>
  <string id="6104757">I hate trying to find things.</string>
  <string id="6104758">I don't like the sound of this.</string>
  <string id="6104759">This is suspicious.</string>
  <string id="6104760">Neither do I, serah, but I cannot carry on.</string>
  <string id="6104766">Here. Take my findings. Perhaps you can make more use of them. I'm going back to the Gallows. I'm too old for this.</string>
  <string id="6104775">These are human bones. Sighs Then there is no chance of finding Mharen alive—or any of the others.</string>
  <string id="6104779">I saw someone leaving the scene, but they got away. I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6104780">I did what I could.</string>
  <string id="6104781">It was more than I accomplished.</string>
  <string id="6104784">I will bring this to the city guard immediately.</string>
  <string id="6104793">If they're not dead, watch out for a bunch of boneless women flopping through the streets.</string>
  <string id="6104794">Yes, they're probably dead.</string>
  <string id="6104795">This isn't over. I'm going to get the bastard that did this.</string>
  <string id="6104796">The killer won't get away.</string>
  <string id="6104800">Is this Ninette's ring?</string>
  <string id="6104803">Look at the engraving. Forever faithful, forever yours. Sighs Written in happier times.</string>
  <string id="6104804">It was on Ninette's hand, which was cut from her body. She's dead.</string>
  <string id="6104805">On her severed hand.</string>
  <string id="6104806">On her... hand? I see. Well, maybe you should... take this back.</string>
  <string id="6104818">I don't want anything that might link me to her... death. Especially with her family asking questions.</string>
  <string id="6104821">Just know that she will not return.</string>
  <string id="6104822">It doesn't matter.</string>
  <string id="6104826">I'll send the ring to her family. With luck, it will appease them.</string>
  <string id="6104832">Thank you for all your help, serah. Maker watch over you.</string>
  <string id="6104841">We'll pull this off. Just you watch.</string>
  <string id="6104842">I'm with you. Trust in that.</string>
  <string id="6104843">Give them something to scare their grandkids with.</string>
  <string id="6104847">They don't know sacrifice.</string>
  <string id="6104848">The Maker is with us.</string>
  <string id="6104855">I don't know where I fit, but I am with you.</string>
  <string id="6104856">We can't just go back.</string>
  <string id="6104875">The templar who allowed Father to leave Kirkwall. Your namesake.</string>
  <string id="6104878">A templar?</string>
  <string id="6104881">Have we met a templar who isn't a colossal prig?</string>
  <string id="6104882">You're really going to look for a dark side to this?</string>
  <string id="6104883">More whining?</string>
  <string id="6104884">I should just embrace a stranger? How's that better than blindly honoring the Amells?</string>
  <string id="6104885">Father must have felt he was worth honoring.</string>
  <string id="6104886">Ser Maurevar was a good one.</string>
  <string id="6104887">A man who let him look ahead, and a name that would always mean skill thoughtfully applied.</string>
  <string id="6104890">Well, there you go then.</string>
  <string id="6104891">Then it suits you.</string>
  <string id="6104895">I'm sure someone thought far too long about my name. Point is, this was a swordsman.</string>
  <string id="6104898">A man who let him look ahead. It would always mean skill thoughtfully applied.</string>
  <string id="6104904">You're right, this is... it's something. I get it.</string>
  <string id="6104907">I don't know where to take it. But thank you.</string>
  <string id="6104917">For your service that cannot be admitted, I ask that you accept this trinket, and know that I shall respect your name.</string>
  <string id="6104920">Thank you, conscience of the order, Ser Maurevar... Carver.</string>
  <string id="6104923">Carver?</string>
  <string id="6104924">I want to be someone. Like Father wanted. Like I want. This is my chance.</string>
  <string id="6104934">Then let me tell you what really happened.</string>
  <string id="6104935">Reward Offered!</string>
  <string id="6104936">Citizens of Kirkwall:&#13;
&#13;
My dear wife, Ninette, has gone missing! I shall reward the person who returns her safely.&#13;
&#13;
Questions about the bounty or Ninette? Come speak to me in the Hightown Market.&#13;
&#13;
—Ghyslain de Carrac</string>
  <string id="6104937">Why do you listen to this garbage? Do you just love gossip?</string>
  <string id="6104938">What do you get out of this?</string>
  <string id="6104939">I'm sure I can't be the only one mentioned in these rumors. What do they say about you?</string>
  <string id="6104940">Are you in these tales?</string>
  <string id="6104941">You had better not be spreading wild rumors about me.</string>
  <string id="6104942">Watch what you say.</string>
  <string id="6104943">I appreciate you keeping an ear to the ground for me.</string>
  <string id="6104944">That's reassuring.</string>
  <string id="6104945">It fills my heart with joy to know you're not telling people I'm sleeping with an ogre.</string>
  <string id="6104946">You're too kind.</string>
  <string id="6104949">This is, beyond a doubt, the most wretched place I've ever been. The sooner we get back to Kirkwall, the better.</string>
  <string id="6104950">What are we looking for again? Wood? In the wilderness? Sure, that shouldn't be a problem.</string>
  <string id="6104951">I don't know if that stuff we picked up is ironbark, but I bet that alchemist won't either. Let's go back to town.</string>
  <string id="6104952">I've got to say, Hawke, I don't trust any dwarf who'd come out here of his own volition.</string>
  <string id="6104953">If the Deep Roads is what you want, you have the coin to do it.</string>
  <string id="6104954">Captain.</string>
  <string id="6104957">Onions on my collar?</string>
  <string id="6104960">I don't know what you're talking about.</string>
  <string id="6104968">Renegade Templar</string>
  <string id="6104972">De Launcet Mansion</string>
  <string id="6104976">Renegade Templar</string>
  <string id="6104978">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6104985">I've lived all my life in Kirkwall, and until now, I've managed to avoid coming here. Wish I'd kept that up.</string>
  <string id="6104989">You know what I love about the Undercity? Absolutely nothing.</string>
  <string id="6104992">I don't know what the ancient Tevinters used this place for, but I bet it wasn't making people feel at home.</string>
  <string id="6104994">That foolish woman has caused me nothing but embarrassment. She needs to be dragged home.</string>
  <string id="6105000">It's her own doing, gallivanting about with men half her age.</string>
  <string id="6105042">Dog</string>
  <string id="6105046">They believe this is reason enough for me to hurt her. But I swear on Andraste's pyre: I have done nothing.</string>
  <string id="6105060">Hey Moe. I'm sitting on a chair!</string>
  <string id="6105063">Yeah, so what? I'm leaning on a wall.</string>
  <string id="6105066">Yeah, but sitting on a chair leaves my arms free to point at things.</string>
  <string id="6105069">I'm going to go home and cry.</string>
  <string id="6105074">If you can find Ninette, I will gladly pay you.</string>
  <string id="6105077">You don't even care if your wife's alive or dead. I'm not helping you.</string>
  <string id="6105078">You're vile. I won't help you.</string>
  <string id="6105373">I've always kind of liked this place. It's like a building full of sweet old grandmothers.</string>
  <string id="6105376">This place reminds me way too much of the Merchants Guild.</string>
  <string id="6105379">Ah, Hightown. Where the rich go to piss their money away. This really is the best place in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6105380">Keep a hand on your coin, Hawke. There are more cutpurses in Hightown than in the rest of the city combined.</string>
  <string id="6105383">Maybe I should have seen this coming. Iwan has been obsessed with that thing.</string>
  <string id="6105384">Back to the barracks. I never tire of it.</string>
  <string id="6105385">It's different here as captain. Feels like... family.</string>
  <string id="6105386">Still having trouble? I thought you were past all that.</string>
  <string id="6105387">You're not happy as a guard?</string>
  <string id="6105396">I'm a Fereldan in Kirkwall. I don't have much say in who I deal with.</string>
  <string id="6105397">Bartrand is my only option.</string>
  <string id="6105401">Bust some teeth, then buy the drinks. It worked here, but guards can be strange like that.</string>
  <string id="6105409">It's pretty here at night. Once the nobles are out of the way, you can really admire the scenery.</string>
  <string id="6105412">This is the best tavern in Kirkwall. It could use some cute dwarven serving girls, but otherwise, it's perfect.</string>
  <string id="6105415">You want a pint while we're here, Hawke? I'll buy.</string>
  <string id="6105418">Despite the name, Lowtown's not so bad. Just... more likely to be destroyed by tidal waves than Hightown.</string>
  <string id="6105421">A lot of people are afraid to come here at night. I don't know why. The thieves will still shoot you in daylight.</string>
  <string id="6105424">Bartrand likes to make me deal with the harbormaster. That man always smells like cod liver oil.</string>
  <string id="6105427">Have I mentioned that dwarves are lousy swimmers? Just... keep that in mind before you talk to any drunk sailors.</string>
  <string id="6105428">You mind stopping by the Hanged Man, Hawke? I think we should talk over a pint. </string>
  <string id="6105429">Story time, Hawke! What do you say we head over to the Hanged Man?</string>
  <string id="6105430">If you've got a minute, Hawke, maybe we could go to the Hanged Man and chat.</string>
  <string id="6105431">When we get back to the city, we should talk. Let's go to the Hanged Man. I'll buy you a drink.</string>
  <string id="6105432">Hawke... no. Let's save this for when we get back. We'll go to the Hanged Man and talk.</string>
  <string id="6105434">By the Stone, I thought I was done for. Wait, you... you're Mistress Hawke! I can't believe it's you!</string>
  <string id="6105435">I've heard the stories, but it's not the same as actually being down here.</string>
  <string id="6105436">Heh, let me try that on the dwarf. Just to see his face.</string>
  <string id="6105437">You have a unique charm, Aveline. I doubt the same would work on the dwarf.</string>
  <string id="6105438">You and your subtle charms.</string>
  <string id="6105439">Trying that on Bartrand would be very funny for a very short period of time.</string>
  <string id="6105440">Tempting, but I doubt Bartrand would respond well.</string>
  <string id="6105441">A tactic with a narrow appeal, certainly.</string>
  <string id="6105442">Sounds like fun. Not for the dwarf, but still.</string>
  <string id="6105446">A person in your position, seems like they might learn some profitable things.</string>
  <string id="6105447">Eavesdrop anything useful?</string>
  <string id="6105448">Iwan is probably dead by now. It's what he deserves.</string>
  <string id="6105449">I doubt it.</string>
  <string id="6105450">Yes, but it gives me no satisfaction to know he dug his own grave.</string>
  <string id="6105457">From what I've heard, he's just as nasty as the darkspawn. Maybe they'll crown him their new king.</string>
  <string id="6105458">I'm sure he'll be fine.</string>
  <string id="6105459">Let's get you out of here before the darkspawn return.</string>
  <string id="6105460">You need to get to safety.</string>
  <string id="6105463">Lately, I don't know. I've been pushed out to some dead patrols. Maybe I stepped on someone's toes.</string>
  <string id="6105468">You know better than to ask that.</string>
  <string id="6105471">One day you'll be frustrated enough to go for it.</string>
  <string id="6105476">We're surrounded by nothing for as far as the eye can see. Why do we keep coming here?</string>
  <string id="6105479">This place gives me the creeps. It's probably the name. They should call it the pie fields. Everyone likes pie.</string>
  <string id="6105482">This is some of the most expensive real estate in Kirkwall. Usually paid for in body parts.</string>
  <string id="6105485">How many servants do you think it takes to clean the rafters in this place?</string>
  <string id="6105487">I couldn't bring back your wife, but here's a ring. It looks pricey.</string>
  <string id="6105490">This ring is all I have to return to you. I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6105493">You know, I think the Chant of Light would be more popular if it had more battles in it. Just a hunch.</string>
  <string id="6105496">I don't know how they do it where you're from, Guardswoman, but I decide the patrols, not you and your whims!</string>
  <string id="6105502">You may have been put up for lieutenant in your first year, but I'll have no show-offs in my command! Have I made myself clear?</string>
  <string id="6105508">Report to your post, before I have you and your Fereldan accomplice jailed!</string>
  <string id="6105518">Don't look, but I think that whore's making eyes at you.</string>
  <string id="6105521">Ah... Ninette's wedding ring. Yes.</string>
  <string id="6105526">Where did you find it?</string>
  <string id="6105528">We'll accept your help.</string>
  <string id="6105529">We'll accept your help.</string>
  <string id="6105530">We'll accept your help.</string>
  <string id="6105531">We'll accept your help.</string>
  <string id="6105532">We'll accept your help.</string>
  <string id="6105533">We'll accept your help.</string>
  <string id="6105534">We'll accept your help.</string>
  <string id="6105537">Don't make eye contact with the dwarf merchants here. I've skipped the last five guild meetings.</string>
  <string id="6105550">Let's find Hadriana quickly and be done with it.</string>
  <string id="6105554">You intend to bring us to Hadriana soon, I hope.</string>
  <string id="6105555">Welcome to my home.</string>
  <string id="6105558">I wonder how long I will be allowed to remain here?</string>
  <string id="6105561">I would offer you something to drink, but the kitchen is remarkably bare.</string>
  <string id="6105564">Good. Privacy at last.</string>
  <string id="6105586">I live here, you know.</string>
  <string id="6105589">Then I stand corrected.</string>
  <string id="6105592">And that's just on the good menu.</string>
  <string id="6105595">And you keep a room here?</string>
  <string id="6105598">Not all of us can squat in the lap of luxury. Not without tipping, anyway.</string>
  <string id="6105601">And this is one of the better taverns around here.</string>
  <string id="6105604">Do you like anything?</string>
  <string id="6105607">I like quiet.</string>
  <string id="6105610">It's early, yet.</string>
  <string id="6105613">Excellent point.</string>
  <string id="6105618">I didn't think you'd come!</string>
  <string id="6105622">I'll find something relatively clean for you to sit on.</string>
  <string id="6105623">Grunts They're going to blame me, I just know it.</string>
  <string id="6105631">You took more than I thought you would.</string>
  <string id="6105638">It's not the first time he's made me wonder like this. Something is very wrong.</string>
  <string id="6105639">I don't have time for politics in the guard.</string>
  <string id="6105640">Not my problem.</string>
  <string id="6105641">Then we should check the duty roster, and see who was supposed to take that route.</string>
  <string id="6105644">What have I stepped in this time?</string>
  <string id="6105647">Threaten my friends... not letting that one go, Captain.</string>
  <string id="6105650">Sighs It's better this way. Our marriage has been in shambles for more than a decade.</string>
  <string id="6105655">Can I get you something to eat or drink? I have... water.</string>
  <string id="6105656">I wouldn't even drink the water from this part of the city.</string>
  <string id="6105657">Not even on a dare.</string>
  <string id="6105658">I came here to see you, Merrill. You don't have to fuss over me.</string>
  <string id="6105659">Relax.</string>
  <string id="6105660">It's... cozy. And your furry friends are charming.</string>
  <string id="6105661">Lovely place you have here.</string>
  <string id="6105668">Of course. I can't thank you enough for coming when you did, messere.</string>
  <string id="6105671">Oh! You're here! After what you said, I thought...</string>
  <string id="6105674">I boil it first. A few times, actually. Sometimes, it won't stop twitching.</string>
  <string id="6105675">You're so kind. My first guest, and I'm already a terrible host.</string>
  <string id="6105676">Oh, are the rats back? I thought I found all their holes.</string>
  <string id="6105680">I can't believe Iwan is gone.</string>
  <string id="6105683">Why would it matter which guard killed those bandits?</string>
  <string id="6105686">A lot of yelling for doing him a favor.</string>
  <string id="6105689">We killed a band of highwaymen. What does it matter whose patrol it was?</string>
  <string id="6105692">Well, what a charming fellow.</string>
  <string id="6105695">I don't have to like him, but he could at least listen. Bandits are dead—that's all that should matter.</string>
  <string id="6105698">So let's find out whose toes you actually stepped on.</string>
  <string id="6105699">Well, whose patrol was it?</string>
  <string id="6105700">This is probably a bad time to discuss my bill with him.</string>
  <string id="6105701">So I'm not getting paid.</string>
  <string id="6105702">He'll jail you, I don't doubt that. The rest, though...</string>
  <string id="6105705">What can I say? Why work if you're not working hard?</string>
  <string id="6105706">I don't want to hire you. I'm here about Ninette.</string>
  <string id="6105707">It's not your headache. You've got an expedition to float, I know.</string>
  <string id="6105710">May as well check the roster to see if I'll have time to help you. I'll bet I'm off patrols for a while.</string>
  <string id="6105715">Well, the duty roster will have my next patrol. Sounds like I'll have plenty of time to follow you around.</string>
  <string id="6105718">Beggar</string>
  <string id="6105726">I wanted to thank you for bringing me here, but I'm making a mess of it.</string>
  <string id="6105727">Spare some change?</string>
  <string id="6105730">About your brother... oh, Hawke, I'm so sorry.</string>
  <string id="6105743">What do you say we head to the Hanged Man for a bit?</string>
  <string id="6105744">We should talk. Come on, I'll buy you a drink.</string>
  <string id="6105745">Time for a story, Hawke! What do you say we head over to the Hanged Man for a bit?</string>
  <string id="6105748">When we get back to the city, we should talk.</string>
  <string id="6105749">I've heard the nobles grousing about the commoners moving up. Congratulations, Hawke! You ruined the neighborhood!</string>
  <string id="6105752">If you want a drink, order it from Corff. In three years, Norah has never gotten my order right.</string>
  <string id="6105759">Huh, must be a slow night.</string>
  <string id="6105764">I can see why Ninette liked you. You're feisty.</string>
  <string id="6105767">Chuckles A refreshing change from the pale slug I married.</string>
  <string id="6105772">One of my favorites.</string>
  <string id="6105786">Lowtown never changes. Except for adding a bunch of horned giants, I mean.</string>
  <string id="6105789">You know who I don't want to meet in a Lowtown alley at night? Pretty much anyone.</string>
  <string id="6105792">What is that smell? Why does this place always smell?</string>
  <string id="6105795">This place rivals the Undercity for worst part of Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6105802">The roster's not for commoner eyes, friend.</string>
  <string id="6105808">Aveline!</string>
  <string id="6105811">Brennan, that route was yours?</string>
  <string id="6105814">It was. Single patrol. I'd have been dead for sure.</string>
  <string id="6105815">A guard can't handle a few bandits?</string>
  <string id="6105816">Scared?</string>
  <string id="6105817">I don't like surprises. That route had been clear for weeks.</string>
  <string id="6105820">So there was nothing unusual about it at all?</string>
  <string id="6105821">It was routine?</string>
  <string id="6105822">It had been clear for weeks. It didn't get unusual until after we heard about you and Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6105825">A lone guard isn't much of a patrol.</string>
  <string id="6105826">You would have been alone?</string>
  <string id="6105827">Shouldn't need to be. That route was clear for weeks. First noise out of it was your big fight.</string>
  <string id="6105830">The captain reassigned me after he heard what you did, and I passed the satchel to Donnic for his patrol tonight.</string>
  <string id="6105833">The satchel?</string>
  <string id="6105836">Pay and order assignments. Captain has us run deliveries to the outposts during light duty.</string>
  <string id="6105839">It's usually just an updated copy of the roster. The satchel for that night was heavy, though.</string>
  <string id="6105842">Agreggio Pavali. There are six bottles in the cellar.</string>
  <string id="6105845">Danarius used to have me pour it for his guests. My appearance intimidated them, he said, which he enjoyed.</string>
  <string id="6105846">I can't imagine why they would be put off.</string>
  <string id="6105847">I like your appearance.</string>
  <string id="6105848">You say what's on your mind, I'll give you that.</string>
  <string id="6105851">I'll take that as a compliment.</string>
  <string id="6105854">So they were frightened of you?</string>
  <string id="6105855">Intimidated them?</string>
  <string id="6105856">None of his guests were like you.</string>
  <string id="6105859">You were his servant as well as his bodyguard?</string>
  <string id="6105860">He sounds like a terrible man.</string>
  <string id="6105861">I was his slave. I propped up the furniture, when he was so inclined.</string>
  <string id="6105864">Nothing like a bit of fear with your wine.</string>
  <string id="6105865">Quite the host.</string>
  <string id="6105866">That's what Danarius used to say.</string>
  <string id="6105875">It's good I can still take pleasure in the small things.</string>
  <string id="6105876">You've had a difficult life.</string>
  <string id="6105877">This can't be easy.</string>
  <string id="6105878">Is getting back at your master all that matters to you?</string>
  <string id="6105879">You want revenge?</string>
  <string id="6105880">You could have offered me a glass first, you know.</string>
  <string id="6105881">That was a waste.</string>
  <string id="6105884">I owe you for clearing that ambush the other night. Saved me a mess of trouble.</string>
  <string id="6105887">Anyway, thanks again, Aveline. You're a good one.</string>
  <string id="6105893">So the satchel gets heavy the same day we discover an ambush.</string>
  <string id="6105894">Can't any group in this city stand on its own?</string>
  <string id="6105895">I'm saving city guards now?</string>
  <string id="6105896">A messy way to pass information, and Brennan already sent it along.</string>
  <string id="6105897">A setup to deliver the satchel.</string>
  <string id="6105898">I bet there's a perfectly reasonable lie that explains why your captain arranged this.</string>
  <string id="6105899">Your fellows are being set up.</string>
  <string id="6105900">We do just fine, thank you. But if our own captain is putting us in danger...</string>
  <string id="6105901">Another guard is walking into the same trap. I can't let that happen.</string>
  <string id="6105904">Brennan said Donnic... a good man. Donnic... Donnic. I've got his route. </string>
  <string id="6105907">I have to check this, Hawke. These men, they're like you. Like family.</string>
  <string id="6105915">Let's go make sure his quiet patrol stays that way.</string>
  <string id="6105916">I'd be willing to hear it, but not while a guard may be walking into a trap.</string>
  <string id="6105921">You're sure you want to pursue this? This is your superior we're talking about.</string>
  <string id="6105922">This may get you more trouble.</string>
  <string id="6105923">If a guard has been put at risk, a good captain would want to know why.</string>
  <string id="6105926">And if he's not a good captain, I want to know why.</string>
  <string id="6105930">He was supposed to be alone! Get them!</string>
  <string id="6105934">Who... Ave... Aveline? You're a beautiful sight.</string>
  <string id="6105937">Guardsman?</string>
  <string id="6105940">I mean, I was on patrol, and they came out of nowhere. I took a few down but there were too many at once.</string>
  <string id="6105943">The captain said this route was supposed to be quiet.</string>
  <string id="6105950">The seal of the viscount. Office details, city accounts.</string>
  <string id="6105951">The seal of the viscount. Office details, city accounts.</string>
  <string id="6105952">The seal of the viscount. Office details, city accounts.</string>
  <string id="6105953">The seal of the viscount. Office details, city accounts.</string>
  <string id="6105954">The seal of the viscount. Office details, city accounts.</string>
  <string id="6105955">The seal of the viscount. Office details, city accounts.</string>
  <string id="6105956">The seal of the viscount. Office details, city accounts.</string>
  <string id="6105986">Valuable to a guild of thieves.</string>
  <string id="6105989">The seal of the viscount. Office details, city accounts. Valuable to a guild of thieves.</string>
  <string id="6105992">A sacrificial delivery with one of our own. Captain Jeven will answer.</string>
  <string id="6105993">I think a bloody response is in order.</string>
  <string id="6105994">I'd kill him.</string>
  <string id="6105995">That's not the way of a guardsman. Something Jeven has forgotten, if he ever knew it.</string>
  <string id="6105996">Exposing this kind of corruption could make the guards look weak.</string>
  <string id="6105997">It may embarrass the guards.</string>
  <string id="6105998">Then we look weak. The others deserve better.</string>
  <string id="6105999">Selling out his own... forget guard captain, this man needs to be in government.</string>
  <string id="6106000">A politician's scheme.</string>
  <string id="6106001">Not now, Hawke. Jeven needs to see how justice works.</string>
  <string id="6106004">This goes to the office of the viscount. This will be known.</string>
  <string id="6106030">Don't thank me.</string>
  <string id="6106032">You're welcome.</string>
  <string id="6106034">Did you really?</string>
  <string id="6106038">But who better to rebuild respect than the woman who exposed this... embarrassment.</string>
  <string id="6106041">Resolve any outstanding business, Guardswoman. You will be very busy.</string>
  <string id="6106046">How dare you! I am guard captain! I won't be treated like this!</string>
  <string id="6106049">Fereldan bitch! This was none of your affair! I'll see you hanged! Quartered! This will not stand!</string>
  <string id="6106079">You have my thanks. Aveline was wise to bring you. She will make a fine captain.</string>
  <string id="6106082">I'll make it back to the barracks. Thank you for your help.</string>
  <string id="6106083">Let go... of... my... sister!</string>
  <string id="6106086">Is this a human custom?</string>
  <string id="6106088">I'm not, really. If good wishes were enough, everyone in Thedas would be happy.</string>
  <string id="6106089">Not as sweet as you! That is, good wishes are a poor gift after all you've done for me.</string>
  <string id="6106090">And I'm sure that I'm acting like a fool.</string>
  <string id="6106091">Well of course you could.</string>
  <string id="6106117">Happy bark!</string>
  <string id="6106118">Barks</string>
  <string id="6106119">Barks</string>
  <string id="6106123">Thank you, Donnic... it will be grand indeed.</string>
  <string id="6106124">Aveline. Guard-captain.</string>
  <string id="6106127">Not yet, Donnic. But thank you.</string>
  <string id="6106167">I heard about Carver, and I'm sorry, for what it's worth.</string>
  <string id="6106170">I'm so sorry to hear about Bethany.</string>
  <string id="6106173">I didn't need another reason to hate the darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6106177">Apostate prostitutes? Apos-titutes! Laughs</string>
  <string id="6106178">Ah, the Blooming Rose. Where people come... then go.</string>
  <string id="6106182">Folks in Hightown are just as rotten as those in Lowtown. They're just better at hiding it.</string>
  <string id="6106184">Jump to Lowtown</string>
  <string id="6106185">Jump to Lowtown</string>
  <string id="6106186">Ready?</string>
  <string id="6106187">Go!</string>
  <string id="6106188">Go!</string>
  <string id="6106189">Exit</string>
  <string id="6106190">Exit</string>
  <string id="6106192">There might be some stragglers before the main group. Nothing we can't handle.</string>
  <string id="6106193">We're close to the ambush, Hawke. Be ready.</string>
  <string id="6106194">There's our targets! For the Kirkwall guard!</string>
  <string id="6106195">Well-equipped for bandits, but dead is dead and the road is clear.</string>
  <string id="6106198">Captain Jeven needs to know of this. Back to the barracks for your just reward. </string>
  <string id="6106199">There's Jeven's office. Wait while I explain our initiative.</string>
  <string id="6106200">We can't waste time, Hawke. Guardsman Donnic is here somewhere.</string>
  <string id="6106201">We must be getting close to the ambush. I'm not losing another guard to this mess.</string>
  <string id="6106230">Bah, Hightown. Everything fun takes place behind closed doors.</string>
  <string id="6106237">It's not... pretty, but this is where I need to be.</string>
  <string id="6106238">I can't say that I like Kirkwall, but I'm glad to be here.</string>
  <string id="6106241">You say things like that so often, I can't tell.</string>
  <string id="6106242">Dalish aren't that demonstrative with strangers. Especially shem—humans.</string>
  <string id="6106248">Ashaad</string>
  <string id="6106252">Saarebas</string>
  <string id="6106270">I haven't exactly had many friends. Not even among my own clan. This is... tricky.</string>
  <string id="6106284">Could we stop by the tavern? I'm thirsty.</string>
  <string id="6106285">Looking for a ditch to lay facedown in? I could recommend one.</string>
  <string id="6106289">If anyone tries to sell you clams, just say no. The last time I had clams on the docks, I was sick for a week.</string>
  <string id="6106290">Sometimes I come to the docks just to look at the boats.</string>
  <string id="6106320">Don't jump to conclusions. We barely know each other.</string>
  <string id="6106321">We're not friends.</string>
  <string id="6106322">You seem to be getting the hang of it already.</string>
  <string id="6106323">You're doing fine.</string>
  <string id="6106324">It won't take long before you're the most popular girl in the alienage.</string>
  <string id="6106325">You'll make friends.</string>
  <string id="6106356">Watch your step, shem. You don't know how many Dalish arrows are trained on you right now.</string>
  <string id="6106360">Our Keeper is gone. You have no business here, shem. </string>
  <string id="6106363">What made you unpopular with the Dalish?</string>
  <string id="6106364">Why didn't you have friends?</string>
  <string id="6106368">Careful, young shem. The Dalish are not your people. Not all of us want you here.</string>
  <string id="6106372">Sample of Martin's Cargo</string>
  <string id="6106379">I'd double patrols here, if I had my choice. Lowtown is trouble.</string>
  <string id="6106380">Lowtown serves its purpose. It's not always a pretty one, but it's there.</string>
  <string id="6106383">Hightown is the best of Kirkwall. Just ask them.</string>
  <string id="6106384">Hightown hides its worst elements very well. The things people keep behind locked doors...</string>
  <string id="6106387">A hive of scum and villainy. Every city needs the outlet.</string>
  <string id="6106388">I don't get here as often as I should, even as captain.</string>
  <string id="6106391">You'd think the templars would feel some kinship with the guardsmen. This is not the Order Wesley showed me.</string>
  <string id="6106392">The templars are more isolated than ever. I'm often shut out, even as guard captain.</string>
  <string id="6106395">A dangerous place, but if you're sure this is where you need to be, I'm with you.</string>
  <string id="6106396">You made your fortune here. Was that not enough?</string>
  <string id="6106401">Something about this place is unsettling. It's like... underwear that never quite sits right.</string>
  <string id="6106402">I thought I remembered a hat shop around here... </string>
  <string id="6106406">And then Isabela went to the chantry and saw that it was boring. Canticle of Isabela, stanza one, verse one.</string>
  <string id="6106407">You smell that? Smells like repression, doesn't it?</string>
  <string id="6106411">Did you want something? I'm trying very hard not to get eaten here.</string>
  <string id="6106415">If all the elves fought all the Qunari, who do you think would win?</string>
  <string id="6106423">I like Lowtown. It's an honest sort of place. People will rob you blind, but they're honest about it.</string>

  <string id="6106429">I studied magic and history while the others were learning the Vir Tanadhal.</string>
  <string id="6106432">It's good that I left. I'd have made a terrible Keeper. I was never that good with people.</string>
  <string id="6106433">Oh, I know! I just meant I'm trying.</string>
  <string id="6106434">I'm glad you think so.</string>
  <string id="6106435">Mythal, I hope not! I'd manage to say something stupid in front of everyone and embarrass myself.</string>

  <string id="6106564">Anyway, there was someone else looking for Ninette.</string>
  <string id="6106567">A templar. I believe his name was Emeric. He wouldn't sleep with me, either.</string>

  <string id="6106606">Are you certain? I'm willing to listen.</string>
  <string id="6106609">To my whining? Very charitable of you.</string>
  <string id="6106612">There are days when it feels that way.</string>
  <string id="6106615">There's more, if you're really interested.</string>
  <string id="6106618">Perish the thought. How else would you redecorate the walls?</string>
  <string id="6106621">Laughs</string>
  <string id="6106624">I've wanted to leave my past behind me. But it won't stay there.</string>
  <string id="6106627">Tell me, have you never wanted to return to Ferelden?</string>
  <string id="6106628">I grew up in Ferelden. It will always be my home.</string>
  <string id="6106629">I've thought about it.</string>
  <string id="6106630">I've started a life here.</string>
  <string id="6106631">This is my home now.</string>
  <string id="6106632">I have no home left to return to.</string>
  <string id="6106633">Lothering is gone.</string>
  <string id="6106634">The Blight is over. You could rebuild what you lost. Do you truly not want to?</string>
  <string id="6106635">My mother came from Kirkwall. Our heritage is here.</string>
  <string id="6106636">My family is here.</string>
  <string id="6106637">Even if I wanted to, Kirkwall is my home now.</string>
  <string id="6106638">I have a new life.</string>
  <string id="6106639">Having a place where you can put down roots. I understand.</string>
  <string id="6106642">I have to admit, it's an attractive idea.</string>
  <string id="6106643">Maybe someday.</string>
  <string id="6106644">But not now. I understand.</string>
  <string id="6106647">Still, to have the option... must be gratifying.</string>
  <string id="6106648">I'm glad to be out of Ferelden.</string>
  <string id="6106649">Never.</string>
  <string id="6106650">And that's it? You leave it behind so easily?</string>
  <string id="6106651">I lost my brother to the Blight.</string>
  <string id="6106652">It wasn't easy.</string>
  <string id="6106653">And now he no longer matters to you?</string>
  <string id="6106656">I lost my sister to the Blight.</string>
  <string id="6106657">It wasn't easy.</string>
  <string id="6106658">And now she no longer matters to you?</string>
  <string id="6106661">You survive and you move on. What else do you want?</string>
  <string id="6106662">That's right.</string>
  <string id="6106663">Something different. So should you.</string>
  <string id="6106666">We fled the Blight and did what we could. Would you have done differently?</string>
  <string id="6106667">You wouldn't?</string>
  <string id="6106668">No. That is, in fact, exactly what I have done.</string>
  <string id="6106671">I apologize. Your life is your own, it simply... sounds very familiar.</string>
  <string id="6106672">Do you intend to keep living here?</string>
  <string id="6106673">You're staying in Kirkwall?</string>
  <string id="6106674">You've been on the run a long time, then?</string>
  <string id="6106675">How long since you escaped?</string>
  <string id="6106676">You could track your former master down, I assume.</string>
  <string id="6106677">Where is Danarius now?</string>
  <string id="6106679">You could make a home here.</string>
  <string id="6106680">Don't leave, then. Stay.</string>
  <string id="6106683">If you're looking to start a life, you could stay.</string>
  <string id="6106686">Maybe it's just me, but it sounds like you want to stick around.</string>
  <string id="6106689">I could see myself staying—for the right reasons.</string>
  <string id="6106692">We shall see.</string>
  <string id="6106696">You whine too much.</string>
  <string id="6106697">Are you finished complaining yet?</string>
  <string id="6106700">I am now.</string>
  <string id="6106703">You know, you could stop dwelling on the past.</string>
  <string id="6106706">I could.</string>
  <string id="6106709">Don't you have anything positive to say?</string>
  <string id="6106712">The wine was tasty?</string>
  <string id="6106715">Sounds like a tough situation.</string>
  <string id="6106716">I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6106717">I am not made of glass.</string>
  <string id="6106720">I should thank you again for helping me against the hunters.</string>
  <string id="6106723">Had I known Anso would find me a woman so capable, I might have asked him to look sooner.</string>
  <string id="6106724">Had I known Anso would find me a man so capable, I might have asked him to look sooner.</string>
  <string id="6106725">Had I known the result would be meeting someone worthy of respect, I would have opted for Anso's plan sooner.</string>

  <string id="6106772">I think I know where that warehouse is.</string>
  <string id="6106774">So to a warehouse now.</string>
  <string id="6106775">A warehouse, now? We're being played with. </string>
  <string id="6106776">A warehouse? I don't like being led around. Unless leashes are involved. And they're not.</string>
  <string id="6106777">Oh! To a warehouse next! It's like a treasure hunt!</string>
  <string id="6106778">And to a warehouse now... to search for crates?</string>
  <string id="6106807">Carver is strong. If Anders could survive the Joining, I'm sure he will.</string>
  <string id="6106810">You'll see him again.</string>
  <string id="6106813">You'll see her again.</string>
  <string id="6106814">I did all I could. Nothing to do now but wait.</string>
  <string id="6106815">We'll see.</string>
  <string id="6106816">Thank you, Merrill. I hope you're right.</string>
  <string id="6106817">I hope so.</string>
  <string id="6106818">Right now, I'm more concerned about telling my mother what happened.</string>
  <string id="6106819">I'm more afraid of my mother.</string>
  <string id="6106836">If you're stuck, at least bring me along. I could sleep through the jobs I'm given here.</string>
  <string id="6106866">If this elf never returned, how do you know the Wardens' cure worked?</string>
  <string id="6106867">How do you know?</string>
  <string id="6106868">I wish there was more I could do.</string>
  <string id="6106869">I'm certain that everything will turn out well.</string>
  <string id="6106870">Oh, she will be so upset! Not that it's your fault! And... I'm not helping, am I?</string>
  <string id="6106873">It's like I'm sitting on my hands. There are dangerous people in this city.</string>
  <string id="6106876">In fact, I might have a job for you. Let me know if you want to do a favor for Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6106879">Otherwise, I'm here if you need me. Maker knows I could use more satisfying work.</string>
  <string id="6106880">All right, Aveline. You have something worth doing?</string>
  <string id="6106881">What's the job?</string>
  <string id="6106882">Seems like Kirkwall suits you.</string>
  <string id="6106883">Are you happy here?</string>
  <string id="6106886">Take care, Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6106887">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="6106888">Watch out for yourself, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6106891">You must have heard the story: A Dalish Grey Warden led an army against the Archdemon at Denerim. That was him.</string>
  <string id="6106892">She became a great hero. She led an army against the Blight and won. You must have heard the tale.</string>
  <string id="6106893">Of course not! I know my place. I offer a service, that's all.</string>
  <string id="6106899">My patrols may be empty walks in the dark, but there's something big coming up, and I could use you.</string>
  <string id="6106911">An ambush. Probably for a caravan, although I can't find any shipments that match up.</string>
  <string id="6106914">Doesn't matter, though. Highwaymen waiting for someone to rob? I'm putting a stop to it, my district or not.</string>
  <string id="6106915">I'm no guard, Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6106916">You can hire civilians?</string>
  <string id="6106917">Do you have a name or anything else to go on?</string>
  <string id="6106918">Who are we up against?</string>
  <string id="6106919">Seems like you'd want to share this with your fellow guards.</string>
  <string id="6106920">Why not tell the other guards?</string>
  <string id="6106921">Aveline, you've got yourself a partner.</string>
  <string id="6106922">Let's do it.</string>
  <string id="6106923">Not interested in doing someone else's job for them.</string>
  <string id="6106924">Get a guard to do it.</string>
  <string id="6106925">She always liked men in uniform. You could ask him, yourself.</string>
  <string id="6106929">I told you what I know. Sorry it wasn't what you wanted.</string>
  <string id="6106931">Not important. If we show up and they attack, they're bad, simple as that.</string>
  <string id="6106933">I knew I could count on you.</string>
  <string id="6106936">They're hidden up Sundermount. Remote and rough, but we can make good time with a shortcut this side.</string>
  <string id="6106939">And no, you can't run off and do it without me. I trust you, but I have to be there.</string>
  <string id="6106942">You're acting on behalf of the guard.</string>
  <string id="6106943">It won't wait forever, Hawke. This group is out to hurt someone, and I can't let that happen.</string>
  <string id="6106944">So, what can I do for you?</string>
  <string id="6106947">Maker knows I'm none too busy. If there's something you need, I'm with you.</string>
  <string id="6106948">You had something you thought I would be interested in?</string>
  <string id="6106949">About that job.</string>
  <string id="6106950">The ambush, yes. Sundermount, when you're ready. I'll give more when we get there.</string>
  <string id="6106953">You have the details. Highwaymen. I want to clear them before anyone gets hurt.</string>
  <string id="6106954">Still hard at work trying to please adopted Kirkwall?</string>
  <string id="6106955">Anything new?</string>
  <string id="6106960">My clan has heard nothing from him since then.</string>
  <string id="6106963">He died in the battle.</string>
  <string id="6106968">My clan hasn't heard from her since the battle.</string>
  <string id="6106971">She died fighting the Archdemon.</string>
  <string id="6106976">It's not in my district, but I can't let that stop me.</string>
  <string id="6106978">Not very encouraging, I suppose. Forget I mentioned it. Everything will be fine.</string>
  <string id="6106985">If there's anything I can do, like... not talking anymore, I'll do it.</string>
  <string id="6106990">Carver will be missed.</string>
  <string id="6106993">The blight sickness is terrible. At least he didn't suffer.</string>
  <string id="6106994">You did all you could for him.</string>
  <string id="6106995">Bethany was such a sweet girl.</string>
  <string id="6106998">The corruption is a horrible disease. At least she didn't suffer.</string>
  <string id="6106999">You did everything you could for her.</string>
  <string id="6107000">Better not to dwell on it.</string>
  <string id="6107001">I know.</string>
  <string id="6107002">This isn't easy for me. I appreciate that you're trying to help.</string>
  <string id="6107003">Thank you, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6107004">The hardest part is still coming. I haven't given my mother the news yet.</string>
  <string id="6107005">I still have to tell Mother.</string>
  <string id="6107009">I will, if you sit on your hands. I'll send my alerts, and someone else will lead a patrol.</string>
  <string id="6107012">I just thought you'd like official sanction to cause trouble for once.</string>
  <string id="6107031">You're right.</string>
  <string id="6107032">I wish I could do more.</string>
  <string id="6107033">Elgar'nan! She will be devastated! Er... I'm not helping, am I? Shut up, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6107050">This city is amazing! Do you know, I saw someone get mugged? Right outside! It was fascinating!</string>
  <string id="6107053">Everything happens here all at once! How does anyone keep it all straight?</string>
  <string id="6107054">People don't pay attention, usually.</string>
  <string id="6107055">By ignoring most of it.</string>
  <string id="6107056">You get used to it eventually.</string>
  <string id="6107057">A lot of practice.</string>
  <string id="6107058">I don't think anyone does. Except Varric. And he's probably full of it.</string>
  <string id="6107059">They don't.</string>
  <string id="6107062">There's only so many of us. Temporary recruits are expected,  time to time. As long as they're competent.</string>
  <string id="6107065">You still claim to be competent, right?</string>
  <string id="6107068">I'll wager it's smugglers, though. Like I said, seems like an obvious trap for a caravan.</string>
  <string id="6107070">Someone is jumped outside your door and that's exciting?</string>
  <string id="6107071">Muggings are fascinating?</string>
  <string id="6107072">I can't even imagine how you'd do that.</string>
  <string id="6107073">If not, I suppose you end up like me: walking into walls and signposts, utterly distracted.</string>
  <string id="6107074">Really? Isn't that... sad?</string>
  <string id="6107075">It must be the alienage greeting. Hasn't happened to me yet, though. They must not like me.</string>
  <string id="6107082">You can be... forceful.</string>
  <string id="6107085">My charm, right? I should be able to go where I'm needed.</string>
  <string id="6107096">It's so busy here. So many things just get... lost.</string>
  <string id="6107097">Back again? Sure you're not interested in my many, many services?</string>
  <string id="6107098">I was just passing through.</string>
  <string id="6107099">I'm sure.</string>
  <string id="6107100">I'm sorry to say that Ninette was killed.</string>
  <string id="6107101">Ninette's dead.</string>
  <string id="6107102">Killed? Why would anyone hurt that darling woman?</string>
  <string id="6107105">This is horrible. Thank you for letting me know. Please... please excuse me.</string>
  <string id="6107111">I have coin in my purse and time to spare. Why not?</string>
  <string id="6107112">Perhaps I am.</string>
  <string id="6107116">Have it your way.</string>
  <string id="6107121">Ah... Ghyslain de Carrac's wife. Her disappearance interested me. I tried looking into it.</string>
  <string id="6107126">However, the investigation has been a waste of time.</string>
  <string id="6107139">How could you do that to me? How could you steal a priceless relic of my people?</string>
  <string id="6107140">May the Dread Wolf take you, you worthless hunk of glass!</string>
  <string id="6107143">It won't work! All the years I've wasted on it, and it's still a flaming mirror with no reflection!</string>
  <string id="6107147">I haven't decided. For now it's as good as any other place.</string>
  <string id="6107150">I would return to Seheron if I could, but... there is no life for me there.</string>
  <string id="6107151">Is that where you're from?</string>
  <string id="6107152">Seheron?</string>
  <string id="6107153">So I've been told.</string>
  <string id="6107154">Were you very young when you left, then?</string>
  <string id="6107155">You don't remember?</string>
  <string id="6107156">Perhaps.</string>
  <string id="6107157">Three years, now.</string>
  <string id="6107160">Danarius has a way of finding me—perhaps it is the markings? Whatever the means, it never takes him long to follow.</string>
  <string id="6107163">This is the first time I've given him reason to pause. I suppose there are advantages in numbers.</string>
  <string id="6107164">Haven't you sought help before?</string>
  <string id="6107165">You've been alone?</string>
  <string id="6107166">Hirelings, when I could steal the coin. Never anyone of substance—until you.</string>
  <string id="6107169">Danarius will not give up, however. I await his return.</string>
  <string id="6107170">What if he does give up? What then?</string>
  <string id="6107171">Are you sure?</string>
  <string id="6107175">Then I go to him. I will not live with a wolf at my back.</string>
  <string id="6107176">Sounds like the right idea to me.</string>
  <string id="6107177">Good plan.</string>
  <string id="6107178">If it comes to that. I doubt it will.</string>
  <string id="6107179">You won't let sleeping dogs lie?</string>
  <string id="6107180">Why bother?</string>
  <string id="6107181">No. I am no fool.</string>
  <string id="6107182">I imagine he has returned to Minrathous, though I dare not go near the city while he is alive.</string>
  <string id="6107185">No, it is better to wait for him to leave his fortress. Fight from a fortified position.</string>
  <string id="6107188">I do not expect your help when that day comes, but I would not turn it aside.</string>
  <string id="6107194">I take my debt to you seriously. I want you to know that.</string>
  <string id="6107198">Flatterer.</string>
  <string id="6107199">Talk is cheap.</string>
  <string id="6107202">Is that so?</string>
  <string id="6107205">Maybe I should be thanking Anso.</string>
  <string id="6107208">Maybe you should.</string>
  <string id="6107211">You sound like you're about to ask for a loan.</string>
  <string id="6107214">Well, this mansion does require some upkeep.</string>
  <string id="6107217">Perhaps I'll practice my flattery for your next visit? With any luck I'll become better at it.</string>
  <string id="6107221">Not interested.</string>
  <string id="6107222">Back off.</string>
  <string id="6107225">Let's keep this friendly, shall we?</string>
  <string id="6107228">I'm positive capable is all he was looking for.</string>
  <string id="6107231">Of course. I meant nothing by it.</string>
  <string id="6107234">It turned out well enough.</string>
  <string id="6107235">Happy to help.</string>
  <string id="6107236">It did at that.</string>
  <string id="6107239">I will not keep you longer. Another time, perhaps.</string>
  <string id="6107243">It has been a challenge. Lots of opportunity... if you're the type the locals want.</string>
  <string id="6107273">Hawke... sighs This is awkward.</string>
  <string id="6107274">Listen, Hawke... </string>
  <string id="6107276">Whatever it is, just say it.</string>
  <string id="6107277">Spit it out.</string>
  <string id="6107278">You have no sense for the dramatic.</string>
  <string id="6107279">Whatever it is, I'll hear you out, Varric.</string>
  <string id="6107280">Take your time.</string>
  <string id="6107281">Maker, I hate it when you're reasonable. Call me a filthy nug-licker once in a while, for pity's sake!</string>
  <string id="6107282">You? At a loss for words? I should mark this day on my calendar.</string>
  <string id="6107283">You're struck speechless?</string>
  <string id="6107286">You've done a lot for me. You might have the charm of a sick bronto, but still. There you go.</string>
  <string id="6107287">You did not just compare me to a bronto.</string>
  <string id="6107288">What did you call me?</string>
  <string id="6107289">I... you're welcome, Varric.</string>
  <string id="6107290">That's... kind of you.</string>
  <string id="6107291">If I'm the sick bronto, I guess that makes you the bronto-charmer.</string>
  <string id="6107292">Thanks a lot, Varric.</string>
  <string id="6107293">Enjoy this while it lasts. It might never happen again.</string>
  <string id="6107294">Where does your fascination with tall tales come from?</string>
  <string id="6107295">Why do you tell stories?</string>
  <string id="6107297">Information is power, O Champion of Kirkwall. You of all people should know that.</string>
  <string id="6107298">You should know by now that I love the sound of my own voice, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6107299">I try to keep myself out of the public eye. </string>
  <string id="6107300">Of course not! Not wild ones, at least. I only spread those about Daisy.</string>
  <string id="6107301">I like to think I provide a useful service.</string>
  <string id="6107302">Blondie is hardly an ogre! He's too puny.</string>
  <string id="6107303">Don't call Daisy an ogre! You'll make her cry.</string>
  <string id="6107304">If the Rivaini were an ogre... damnation, that'd be one hot ogre.</string>
  <string id="6107305">Don't compare the Tevinter elf to an ogre, Hawke. Ogres have a sense of humor.</string>
  <string id="6107306">See? It's details like this that keep me hanging around with you, Hawke!</string>
  <string id="6107312">Who's in business with who... who's in bed with who.</string>
  <string id="6107323">Anyway, all I'm saying is, don't be surprised if people look a little nervous around you.</string>
  <string id="6107335">Pants</string>
  <string id="6107338">Keep it down, dog!</string>
  <string id="6107341">Pants</string>
  <string id="6107344">All that noisy dog breath, day in, day out. Make him stop!</string>
  <string id="6107345">He doesn't sweat like we do, and it's stuffy in here. You could open a window.</string>
  <string id="6107346">Let him be, Uncle.</string>
  <string id="6107347">Pants</string>
  <string id="6107350">Pants There! Isn't that annoying?</string>
  <string id="6107353">Pants</string>
  <string id="6107356">Bah! Blight take you.</string>
  <string id="6107379">Looks like they have a base in the Undercity. I hear that's where all the best renegade mages live.</string>
  <string id="6107380">It appears these blood mages are hiding in the Undercity.</string>
  <string id="6107381">Her masters seem to have their base in the Undercity.</string>
  <string id="6107382">We should check this nest of blood mages in the Undercity.</string>
  <string id="6107383">These mages make their lair in the Undercity. Let's root them out.</string>
  <string id="6107384">Hmm... apostate prostitutes? Apos-titutes! Laughs</string>
  <string id="6107385">It seems these mages hide in the Undercity. </string>
  <string id="6107386">It appears our new friends make their home in the Undercity. Shall we pay them a visit?</string>
  <string id="6107389">You keep an ear to the ground, and you can practically run this city.</string>
  <string id="6107407">Someone at the door!</string>
  <string id="6107411">Get them!</string>
  <string id="6107412">Get him!</string>
  <string id="6107413">Get her!</string>
  <string id="6107414">We can't let anyone see this. Kill everyone who's not one of ours!</string>
  <string id="6107433">So, who's going to tell Mother Dearest? She must be just dying to hear what happened.</string>
  <string id="6107434">Whatever their differences, his mother deserves to know he's alive.</string>
  <string id="6107435">We should tell his mother. She'll want to know he's alive.</string>
  <string id="6107436">So, what now? We go tell his mother, your boy's alive, but he hates you?</string>
  <string id="6107437">We should tell the boy's mother what became of him.</string>
  <string id="6107438">Now what do we tell his mother? This is why I'm never having children.</string>
  <string id="6107439">His mother must hear about this. She will be sick with worry.</string>
  <string id="6107440">Well, let's go tell his mother what became of the lad.</string>
  <string id="6107446">Nice hound, Brother. More agreeable than most of your company.</string>
  <string id="6107450">Do you miss the Dalish?</string>
  <string id="6107451">Feeling homesick?</string>
  <string id="6107452">The templars haven't found you, have they?</string>
  <string id="6107453">Have the templars spotted you?</string>
  <string id="6107454">If it lets apostates like me slip through the cracks, I'm for it.</string>
  <string id="6107455">That's not always bad.</string>
  <string id="6107456">Are you feeling lost here, Merrill?</string>
  <string id="6107457">Like you?</string>
  <string id="6107458">Think of it like a game! You can pick up all the things people drop and overlook. Maybe count them.</string>
  <string id="6107459">It's like a treasure hunt!</string>
  <string id="6107472">...don't come running to me next time you pick up one of these diseases.</string>
  <string id="6107475">Isn't that the point of magic?</string>
  <string id="6107481">I don't want to know.</string>
  <string id="6107505">Things just keep getting worse. I had templars practically on my doorstep the other night.</string>
  <string id="6107509">And that will, ah, stop the itch?</string>
  <string id="6107512">Enforcer</string>
  <string id="6107530">Or there's always Gamlen.</string>
  <string id="6107531">Or we could talk to Gamlen.</string>
  <string id="6107532">Gamlen is the reason we've been here for a year.</string>
  <string id="6107533">He got us into this mess.</string>
  <string id="6107534">He got us into Kirkwall. We've been safe so far.</string>
  <string id="6107537">Well, he did get us into the city, right?</string>
  <string id="6107540">He always seems to know what's going on.</string>
  <string id="6107541">That might work.</string>
  <string id="6107542">We might as well ask. Otherwise, I don't know what we'll do...</string>
  <string id="6107545">Or thinks he does.</string>
  <string id="6107548">Our uncle's not exactly the most reliable tool in the shed.</string>
  <string id="6107549">Isn't there anyone else?</string>
  <string id="6107550">He's all we've got. Maker save us.</string>
  <string id="6107556">I don't know. The old saw isn't so bad.</string>
  <string id="6107559">What else can we do? We're losing ground, and I don't fancy waking up in the Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6107572">Carver never told you, but he was a bit jealous a mabari chose you and not him.</string>
  <string id="6107575">Sighs Poor Carver...</string>
  <string id="6107655">Yes. Though I would stay away from women you meet in the port. Pirates tend to... dock in unsavory places.</string>
  <string id="6107658">I heard that!</string>
  <string id="6107661">Just use the salve if it comes back.</string>
  <string id="6107664">Er, excuse me...</string>
  <string id="6107667">The templars are hunting you?</string>
  <string id="6107668">Were they after you?</string>
  <string id="6107669">Not me specifically. They were just checking the refugee camps.</string>
  <string id="6107672">But it's not like this place is a secret. It's only a matter of time.</string>
  <string id="6107682">We haven't talked much recently. How have you been?</string>
  <string id="6107683">I want to know about you.</string>
  <string id="6107688">Good. I just love what Knight-Commander Meredith's done with the place.</string>
  <string id="6107691">The curfews. The midnight raids on mages' families. Everyone I know, forced into hiding so they won't be made Tranquil.</string>
  <string id="6107692">Don't tell me these things. I might have to lock you up to keep them off you.</string>
  <string id="6107693">You need a safer place.</string>
  <string id="6107694">Do you have something you need?</string>
  <string id="6107695">Is this going anywhere?</string>
  <string id="6107696">Sorry. I thought you might have come by to talk. People do that, you know.</string>
  <string id="6107702">There's a good boy.</string>
  <string id="6107705">A few hundred of you, and we'd have taken Lothering. Or had a good shot...</string>
  <string id="6107709">Sweetheart, I'm not letting anyone lock me up, you included.</string>
  <string id="6107712">They're not so much interested in me as... destroying my kind and all I represent.</string>
  <string id="6107717">That's a good dog.</string>
  <string id="6107723">Sister.</string>
  <string id="6107726">Brother.</string>
  <string id="6107729">I feel... I don't know. It's like Mother, taking everything out on us. She was just scared.</string>
  <string id="6107732">I don't have a place in the life she is trying to bring back.</string>
  <string id="6107752">The Bone Pit has been overrun by dragons. Slay them!</string>
  <string id="6107783">It lets apostates like my sister escape notice.</string>
  <string id="6107784">That's not always bad.</string>
  <string id="6107800">I miss Hahren Paivel's stories. The creaking of aravels in the breeze.</string>
  <string id="6107801">I've been careful. Even among the Dalish, Keepers never work magic in public.</string>
  <string id="6107802">I'm certainly not complaining! I'd be cut down on the spot if the templars knew what I was.</string>
  <string id="6107804">A bit. But... I'll adjust.</string>
  <string id="6107805">Laughs I think they mostly drop garbage.</string>
  <string id="6107806">Never mind about the manifest. I'd just like to ask about some cargo.</string>
  <string id="6107807">Can I just talk to you?</string>
  <string id="6107873">The city is so busy and confusing. And the elves here are not like my clan. But I'll get used to Kirkwall in time.</string>
  <string id="6107876">What?</string>
  <string id="6107883">It's no longer my investigation, serah. You may take over, if you wish.</string>
  <string id="6107887">Ninette de Carrac. I hear she got around. And you were asking about her, so I just... assumed.</string>
  <string id="6107890">Preposterous! I was concerned that she was in danger, and that is all!</string>
  <string id="6107975">So the seneschal's tax collector won't be coming around again, like you asked. Funny story.</string>
  <string id="6107978">I'll pass, but thank you for the help.</string>
  <string id="6107981">Spoilsport. Why you want to squat up here in Hightown is beyond me.</string>
  <string id="6107984">I like the view.</string>
  <string id="6107987">So do I.</string>
  <string id="6107999">Those papers weren't easy to forge, you know.</string>
  <string id="6108002">I appreciate your assistance.</string>
  <string id="6108005">Why don't you just sell the blighted place and be done with it?</string>
  <string id="6108008">Sentimental reasons?</string>
  <string id="6108011">Have it your way. Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6108017">Three years.</string>
  <string id="6108020">There's still no sign of Danarius. I'm beginning to wonder if he's finally given up.</string>
  <string id="6108021">This is his mansion, isn't it? He must know you're here.</string>
  <string id="6108022">Are you sure?</string>
  <string id="6108023">Would you be surprised to learn that it isn't, in fact, his mansion?</string>
  <string id="6108026">It belongs to a Tevinter merchant, one who has evidently given up on the place. Perhaps he is dead. Perhaps Danarius killed him.</string>
  <string id="6108029">Either way, if Danarius is aware of my presence, he has done nothing.</string>
  <string id="6108030">Then this is the perfect time to track him down.</string>
  <string id="6108031">Go after him.</string>
  <string id="6108032">I'm not so certain.</string>
  <string id="6108035">Isn't this what you wanted?</string>
  <string id="6108036">Hopefully he has.</string>
  <string id="6108037">Yes, but...</string>
  <string id="6108040">Don't tell me you're going to miss all the attention.</string>
  <string id="6108041">Disappointed?</string>
  <string id="6108045">Tell me: what do you do when you stop running?</string>
  <string id="6108047">You build a life.</string>
  <string id="6108048">What does anyone do? You start over.</string>
  <string id="6108051">You start over. Isn't that what you want?</string>
  <string id="6108054">You take a breath and look around. And start anew.</string>
  <string id="6108057">I don't know how.</string>
  <string id="6108060">Do you really not know?</string>
  <string id="6108061">An odd question.</string>
  <string id="6108062">You weren't always a slave, were you?</string>
  <string id="6108063">Do what you did before.</string>
  <string id="6108064">My first memory is receiving these markings, the lyrium being branded into my flesh.</string>
  <string id="6108067">The agony wiped away everything. Whatever life I had before I became a slave... it's lost.</string>
  <string id="6108073">I shouldn't trouble you with this. My problems are not yours.</string>
  <string id="6108074">You don't know who you were?</string>
  <string id="6108075">You really don't remember?</string>
  <string id="6108076">Fenris was the name Danarius bestowed upon me, his little wolf.</string>
  <string id="6108079">If I once had another name, or a family... then they were taken from me.</string>
  <string id="6108082">But, again, this is not your concern.</string>
  <string id="6108083">Your problems are my problems.</string>
  <string id="6108084">You're my friend.</string>
  <string id="6108085">Unlucky you.</string>
  <string id="6108088">You help me, I help you.</string>
  <string id="6108089">You're my teammate.</string>
  <string id="6108090">I don't need your help.</string>
  <string id="6108093">Let's keep it that way.</string>
  <string id="6108094">That's true.</string>
  <string id="6108095">Then we needn't discuss it further.</string>
  <string id="6108098">We can talk about this, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6108099">I can help you.</string>
  <string id="6108100">Maybe another time.</string>
  <string id="6108103">I doubt it.</string>
  <string id="6108106">But enough. You have much to keep you busy, I'm certain.</string>
  <string id="6108110">Busy doesn't mean bad.</string>
  <string id="6108111">Busy doesn't mean bad.</string>
  <string id="6108112">They're not like you?</string>
  <string id="6108126">Besides, I can never pass up the opportunity to fill someone's head with garbage.</string>
  <string id="6108130">I pray that Mharen is safe. The templars would like to see her back where she belongs.</string>
  <string id="6108131">Please talk to me if you discover anything. Anything at all.</string>
  <string id="6108132">I hope my notes were useful.</string>
  <string id="6108136">Recognize your mage?</string>
  <string id="6108139">What?</string>
  <string id="6108142">This was left in the foundry you mentioned in your notes. I was also attacked by shades.</string>
  <string id="6108145">Look what I found.</string>
  <string id="6108146">You might want to see this.</string>
  <string id="6108157">Show some respect!</string>
  <string id="6108160">I know how you feel, serah.</string>
  <string id="6108214">Coterie Leader</string>
  <string id="6108218">And I think the templars don't even see me. I'm just another elf in the alienage.</string>
  <string id="6108220">Inattention is good.</string>
  <string id="6108221">Inattention is good.</string>
  <string id="6108222">You sound lonely.</string>
  <string id="6108223">It's an adventure.</string>
  <string id="6108230">I'm glad you came by. I needed someone to talk to.</string>
  <string id="6108235">That ring looks Orlesian.</string>
  <string id="6108236">We have to report this.</string>
  <string id="6108237">You can survive without a hand. This doesn't mean anyone's dead.</string>
  <string id="6108238">That's a lot of bones.</string>
  <string id="6108239">Those are... those are human bones, aren't they? I'm going to be sick.</string>
  <string id="6108240">And there's our missing women... or what's left of them.</string>
  <string id="6108241">Need a hand? Why, yes! Yes, I do!</string>
  <string id="6108242">That's a distinctive ring. Can I have it?</string>
  <string id="6108248">A severed hand, a ring, and a pile of bones.</string>
  <string id="6108251">Have you heard from your brother? Is he happy? With the templars, I mean.</string>
  <string id="6108254">Have you heard from your sister? Is she settling in all right with the Circle?</string>
  <string id="6108255">He won't talk to me.</string>
  <string id="6108256">We're not speaking.</string>
  <string id="6108257">Our mother visits him constantly. She says he's doing well.</string>
  <string id="6108258">He seems to be fine.</string>
  <string id="6108259">Carver hates being happy. It interferes with his brooding.</string>
  <string id="6108260">He's not into happiness.</string>
  <string id="6108261">I haven't heard from her.</string>
  <string id="6108262">I don't know.</string>
  <string id="6108263">Our mother checks on her frequently. She seems to be adjusting.</string>
  <string id="6108264">She seems to be fine.</string>
  <string id="6108265">She always did love being constantly watched by large, armed men.</string>
  <string id="6108266">She's having a wonderful time.</string>
  <string id="6108274">More mages. You talk—I'm going to ask the guards about their training.</string>
  <string id="6108295">Hunters.</string>
  <string id="6108298">Stop right there!</string>
  <string id="6108301">You are in possession of stolen property. Back away from the slave now and you'll be spared.</string>
  <string id="6108302">Fenris is a free man!</string>
  <string id="6108303">He's not a slave!</string>
  <string id="6108305">Die, slaver!</string>
  <string id="6108306">You should have attacked while you had the chance!</string>
  <string id="6108307">I won't let you take him!</string>
  <string id="6108308">They'll never learn, will they?</string>
  <string id="6108310">Let's work out a deal!</string>
  <string id="6108311">Come down here, and let's talk about it!</string>
  <string id="6108314">We can negotiate!</string>
  <string id="6108317">Is that your first offer? Because it's not a good one!</string>
  <string id="6108320">I won't repeat myself. Back away from the slave now!</string>
  <string id="6108323">I am not your slave!</string>

  <string id="6108403">Give Marethari the news of the varterral's death.</string>
  <string id="6108405">Merrill has been given the relic against Marethari's wishes.</string>
  <string id="6108406">Merrill did not get the relic she needed to complete her mirror.</string>

I'm glad to hear that Athenril took no vengeance on you for helping me. I surely would have died in her service. My sisters are both maids now, and I have proven myself an able shepherd and have been granted two ewes of my own to start a flock. &#13;
&#13;
I heard you've made a name for yourself in Kirkwall. My hopes for your continued success!&#13;
&#13;
Thank you again.&#13;

  <string id="6108433">He still resents you, then?</string>
  <string id="6108434">I'm glad. Maybe it's not what you would have wanted, but it's good he's found his path.</string>
  <string id="6108435">The poor boy...</string>
  <string id="6108436">I'm sure she's fine.</string>
  <string id="6108437">Maybe it's nice for her to finally live without hiding.</string>
  <string id="6108438">She did? I would never have imagined— Oh.</string>
  <string id="6108442">I know your face. I am Tobrius. You and that man are both Hawkes.</string>
  <string id="6108443">I know your face. I am Tobrius. And you are a Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6108446">Harimann's guards killed all my men. I thought I gave them the slip, but they found me.</string>
  <string id="6108453">My father must have left quite an impression. The letter I found was ancient.</string>
  <string id="6108454">You have a good memory.</string>
  <string id="6108456">Speak to Merrill in her house in the alienage.</string>
  <string id="6108457">Go with Merrill to the demon cave beyond the graveyard on Sundermount.</string>
  <string id="6108458">Slay Keeper Marethari to destroy the demon within her.</string>
  <string id="6108460">Main Plot</string>
  <string id="6108461">Speak to Merrill at her home in Lowtown's alienage.</string>
  <string id="6108462">Finally convinced that she was wrong, Merrill smashed the mirror.</string>
  <string id="6108463">Merrill has given up the idea of saving her people. She intends to complete the mirror for its own sake.</string>
  <string id="6108465">Why trouble yourself over him?</string>
  <string id="6108466">Why so concerned?</string>
  <string id="6108467">I know how hard it is to give up everything and live among strangers.</string>
  <string id="6108474">I thought you and Bethany didn't get along. Why are you worrying over her?</string>
  <string id="6108475">Why so concerned?</string>
  <string id="6108476">I'd be terrified, in her shoes. Surrounded by strangers. Watched all the time...</string>
  <string id="6108483">She's strong. If anyone can get through this, she can.</string>
  <string id="6108486">I worry about him. And not just for his sake...</string>
  <string id="6108487">I know he was angry when he left. But this... wasn't your fault.</string>
  <string id="6108490">One day, he'll understand you were trying to protect him.</string>
  <string id="6108493">We didn't always agree, but she's a sweet girl. I would never wish that fate on anyone.</string>
  <string id="6108497">I wonder how it compares to yours.</string>
  <string id="6108498">I needn't tell his own child how special he was. As to the letter, it pained me to send news of the templar's death.</string>
  <string id="6108509">I have business to attend. Business you're too good to be a part of.</string>
  <string id="6108511">They're on to us, boys.</string>
  <string id="6108514">Let's make sure this don't go any further.</string>
  <string id="6108515">He'll die of old age before he admits I did anything right.</string>
  <string id="6108516">I wouldn't count on it.</string>
  <string id="6108517">Maybe with time, he'll forgive me.</string>
  <string id="6108518">I hope you're right.</string>
  <string id="6108519">I can see it now—the apostate and the templar running from opposite ends of the Gallows to embrace each other.</string>
  <string id="6108520">That will be a touching scene.</string>
  <string id="6108523">Don't blame yourself.</string>
  <string id="6108524">I know it's not my fault. It's the templars who hauled her away.</string>
  <string id="6108525">I blame the templars.</string>
  <string id="6108526">If I'd gotten home sooner, she might still be free.</string>
  <string id="6108527">I should have been there.</string>
  <string id="6108528">Someone's got to blame me. Other than my mother, I mean.</string>
  <string id="6108529">If I don't, who will?</string>
  <string id="6108533">Even if— Well, I just want to make sure they know I didn't do it!</string>
  <string id="6108537">Companions</string>
  <string id="6108539">Secondary</string>
  <string id="6108540">Hawke... I could never have faced the Keeper myself.</string>
  <string id="6108547">Where is he?</string>
  <string id="6108550">Please don't kill me!</string>
  <string id="6108553">Tell me!</string>
  <string id="6108556">I don't know! I don't know, I swear!</string>
  <string id="6108559">Hadriana brought us! She's at the holding caves north of the city! I can show you the way!</string>
  <string id="6108562">No need. I know which ones you speak of.</string>
  <string id="6108565">Then let me go, I beg you! I swear I won't—</string>
  <string id="6108568">You chose the wrong master.</string>
  <string id="6108571">Grunts</string>
  <string id="6108574">Hadriana.</string>
  <string id="6108577">I was a fool to think I was free. They'll never let me be!</string>
  <string id="6108578">This is someone you know?</string>
  <string id="6108579">Who is Hadriana?</string>
  <string id="6108580">My old master's apprentice.</string>
  <string id="6108583">I remember her well: a sniveling social climber that would sell her own children if she thought it would please Danarius.</string>
  <string id="6108586">If she's here, it's at his bidding. I knew he wouldn't let this go!</string>
  <string id="6108588">Calm down, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6108589">This is no time to lose your temper.</string>
  <string id="6108592">It's over, Fenris. They're dead.</string>
  <string id="6108595">We won. You can relax any minute, now.</string>
  <string id="6108599">We go after them.</string>
  <string id="6108600">Looks like we have some hunting to do.</string>
  <string id="6108603">They need to be stopped before this goes any further.</string>
  <string id="6108606">Then why are we standing around?</string>
  <string id="6108609">They're no longer a threat, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6108610">And now they're dead.</string>
  <string id="6108611">There will be more. If Hadriana's here, she won't stop.</string>
  <string id="6108614">We need to find her. We'll send a message to Danarius he won't soon forget.</string>
  <string id="6108615">Lead the way.</string>
  <string id="6108616">You're right.</string>
  <string id="6108617">The holding caves held slaves in the old times, but apparently they are no longer abandoned.</string>
  <string id="6108620">We must go quickly, before Hadriana has a chance to prepare... or flee.</string>
  <string id="6108621">We have more important things on our plate.</string>
  <string id="6108622">Not right now.</string>
  <string id="6108623">More important things. More important to whom?</string>
  <string id="6108626">Fine. I'll mark the caves on your map, but if Hadriana is gone by the time we get around to it...</string>
  <string id="6108629">No one can stay angry forever. Not even Carver. You'll see.</string>
  <string id="6108630">He loves you. He just... doesn't show it very well.</string>
  <string id="6108631">Oh, that would be darling! But how would you arrange to be on opposite sides of the Gallows?</string>
  <string id="6108633">She'll find her way.</string>
  <string id="6108634">Once the templars knew, nothing you could have done would have saved her.</string>
  <string id="6108635">I'm sure your mother doesn't blame you!</string>
  <string id="6108639">Fenris. You've escaped the magister's reach for too long.</string>
  <string id="6108642">So Hadriana finally dares to look for me in the city, does she?</string>
  <string id="6108645">Give yourself up. This is your last warning.</string>
  <string id="6108648">Don't be a fool. We will slaughter you all.</string>
  <string id="6108651">Wrong answer!</string>
  <string id="6108669">I hope the foolish woman turns up soon.</string>
  <string id="6108673">I'm not looking forward to seeing the Keeper again.</string>
  <string id="6108674">Everyone is staring at me. Let's get this over with.</string>
  <string id="6108675">I've tried everything, but I can't get the mirror to do anything. It doesn't even reflect. That's probably bad.</string>
  <string id="6108676">If I get the eluvian to work, I wonder where it will show me...</string>
  <string id="6108690">Things will be all right. Somehow.</string>
  <string id="6108695">I trusted you!</string>
  <string id="6108696">Your obsession with this mirror got you exiled from your people and turned you to blood magic.</string>
  <string id="6108697">I'm trying to help you.</string>
  <string id="6108700">You told me the eluvian killed someone. You want to rebuild something that dangerous in the middle of Kirkwall?</string>
  <string id="6108701">You can't finish the mirror.</string>
  <string id="6108713">We can't go, yet. We need to find Hadriana.</string>
  <string id="6108717">Finish up, Hawke. We need to get to the caves.</string>
  <string id="6108721">This is your fault!</string>
  <string id="6108724">I told you Hadriana needed to be dealt with! And here she attacks us again!</string>
  <string id="6108725">Back off, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6108726">Watch your tone.</string>
  <string id="6108727">And what should I do instead? Thank you?</string>
  <string id="6108730">We should have done something about this sooner.</string>
  <string id="6108731">You're right.</string>
  <string id="6108732">I agree. Hadriana is waiting, and who knows when she will strike next?</string>
  <string id="6108735">It's not like her attacks are all that hard to deal with.</string>
  <string id="6108736">She's not very good at it.</string>
  <string id="6108737">That's not the point!</string>
  <string id="6108740">What if the hunters come to the mansion next? I won't wait to see if you'll be there the next time.</string>
  <string id="6108743">We go now, or I do.</string>
  <string id="6108744">Then let's do it now.</string>
  <string id="6108745">Lead the way.</string>
  <string id="6108746">It's about time.</string>
  <string id="6108749">As soon as we leave, I'll take us there.</string>
  <string id="6108752">You can do what you like, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6108753">Then go.</string>
  <string id="6108754">And here I thought you might be different.</string>
  <string id="6108757">That's what I thought.</string>
  <string id="6108760">May our paths not cross again, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6108763">They let you in. It can't be that much better.</string>
  <string id="6108768">His mood's definitely improved, but he's too frisky to be cooped up in this shack all day. We need more space.</string>
  <string id="6108774">You're horrible!</string>
  <string id="6108777">Ghyslain de Carrac's wife, Ninette. You were asking about her.</string>
  <string id="6108784">A woman goes missing, and you'll either never find her... or you'll just find her body.</string>
  <string id="6108785">Maker's breath! Can't you... do this when I'm not around?</string>
  <string id="6108786">What? You're going with him? Now?</string>
  <string id="6108789">Isabela, that's horrible!</string>
  <string id="6108792">It's the truth, Kitten. The world's not kind to women.</string>
  <string id="6108794">Run along and play, Bethany.</string>
  <string id="6108795">Quiet.</string>
  <string id="6108796">Fine. I'll do this some other day.</string>
  <string id="6108797">Maybe another time.</string>
  <string id="6108798">It's too late. The images are already in my mind, and they will never, ever go away.</string>
  <string id="6108803">This is not why we came to Kirkwall!</string>
  <string id="6108806">I can't believe you even... considered... doing that. And with me in the next room!</string>
  <string id="6108809">Yes, now. You wait here.</string>
  <string id="6108810">Quiet, you.</string>
  <string id="6108811">This is just... wrong.</string>
  <string id="6108821">I hope you're wrong, madam.</string>
  <string id="6108824">I had a friend who disappeared once. Turns out he was under my bed, drunk.</string>
  <string id="6108830">What?</string>
  <string id="6108839">She's your wife, not a dog!</string>
  <string id="6108842">At least a dog could be trained!</string>
  <string id="6108845">These are by Father? Are you sure they aren't meant for you? I bet another mage could get more out of them.</string>
  <string id="6108848">But it wouldn't be personal.</string>
  <string id="6108873">Thank you, Sister. It's... a connection I didn't think was there.</string>
  <string id="6108886">Not a good place to linger, Sister.</string>
  <string id="6108887">Not a good place to linger, Brother.</string>
  <string id="6108888">Seems like he thought it held some promise.</string>
  <string id="6108891">Not a link back, but how to go forward. That's what I was to him.</string>
  <string id="6108894">I... don't know what to say. Except... thank you.</string>
  <string id="6108904">Maybe you should stop whining about Mother's name and try living up to yours.</string>
  <string id="6108909">We didn't have half of this in Lothering.</string>
  <string id="6108912">All this squalor. Why do they allow themselves to live like this?</string>
  <string id="6108915">All this wealth. What are they even doing with it all?</string>
  <string id="6108918">Turn a rock over, this is what you see.</string>
  <string id="6108921">Nice place. Maybe Gamlen could move here.</string>
  <string id="6108924">Are these the same Qunari as the one caged outside Lothering? I don't remember the horns.</string>
  <string id="6108925">Let's try not to anger the giants. We have enough enemies among our own kind.</string>
  <string id="6108928">A tense place. Every face carries it.</string>
  <string id="6108931">I have never seen such reverence. Not even in the chantry.</string>
  <string id="6108934">Are mages worth this kind of cage? How much worse is the magic in Kirkwall that this is needed?</string>
  <string id="6108937">It's not so bad, is it? But I suppose the walls aren't for me.</string>
  <string id="6108940">How much goes through here in a day? Is there enough trade across Ferelden to account for this?</string>
  <string id="6108943">It's not a chantry without Sister Leliana's singing. And her shock of red.</string>
  <string id="6108944">Fell asleep during the chant, once. They rap your knuckles good for that.</string>
  <string id="6108947">How long must we hike this mountain? I tire of majestic wonder.</string>
  <string id="6108950">I'm not fond of wandering the wilderness. We'll end up wolf bait.</string>
  <string id="6108951">I found a letter you sent. About a friend of his you could not name.</string>
  <string id="6108952">You wrote to my father.</string>
  <string id="6108953">Ah, the templar. Your father could not write to him directly, lest the order find out.</string>
  <string id="6108954">I'm just here about a letter you sent. I'm not honoring any debts.</string>
  <string id="6108955">What was he to you?</string>
  <string id="6108959">I found a small box of Father’s things in the estate.</string>
  <string id="6108962">We left that all behind. We had such hope...</string>
  <string id="6108965">Keep it. Share it with your sister. It’s all part of the life that I owe you.</string>
  <string id="6108966">Keep it. Share it with your brother. It’s all part of the life that I owe you.</string>
  <string id="6108967">Letter? Ah, word of the templar's death. I was sad to send it, but someone had to tell your father.</string>
  <string id="6108984">Lord Harrowmont, what do we do with the human?</string>
  <string id="6108987">Stand down. He's not our foe.</string>
  <string id="6108991">I've never seen a dwarven lord.</string>
  <string id="6108992">You're a lord?</string>
  <string id="6108993">I'm Renvil Harrowmont, the last of my house. My family was once revered in Orzammar.</string>
  <string id="6108996">Now, I'm nothing but a surfacer on the run.</string>
  <string id="6108997">You must have greatly angered the Carta for them to attack you with so many witnesses around.</string>
  <string id="6108998">Why is the Carta after you?</string>
  <string id="6108999">My family was murdered one by one by King Bhelen after my uncle failed to claim the throne.</string>
  <string id="6109002">Bhelen's reach is long and his vengeance a terrible thing to behold.</string>
  <string id="6109003">I'll clear the way for you, Harrowmont.</string>
  <string id="6109004">I'll help.</string>
  <string id="6109005">This business doesn't concern me.</string>
  <string id="6109006">Not my affair.</string>
  <string id="6109007">What is your name?</string>
  <string id="6109010">Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6109013">A good name. I will remember it.</string>
  <string id="6109016">The Carta has several groups lying in wait for us. Take the battle to them.</string>
  <string id="6109022">I wager you've a bright future ahead of you. Take this. More will come, as promised.</string>
  <string id="6109025">May the Stone look after you.</string>
  <string id="6109028">I know you've betrayed me!</string>
  <string id="6109034">Search the Docks for the Carta.</string>
  <string id="6109035">We can't wait too long.</string>
  <string id="6109039">King Bhelen will be most pleased. Here, for your troubles.</string>
  <string id="6109045">Harrowmont spoke to you, didn't he?</string>
  <string id="6109048">Whatever reward he offered, we'll offer you more to kill him.</string>
  <string id="6109049">How about I take care of you, instead?</string>
  <string id="6109050">Time to die.</string>
  <string id="6109051">Better be a lot more than he's offering, dwarf.</string>
  <string id="6109052">I'll kill Harrowmont for you.</string>
  <string id="6109053">I want nothing to do with this.</string>
  <string id="6109054">Count me out of this.</string>
  <string id="6109055">Human bastard!</string>
  <string id="6109058">The purse will be heavy, indeed.</string>
  <string id="6109061">Then Harrowmont is a dead man.</string>
  <string id="6109064">Last of His Line</string>
  <string id="6109065">Side Quests</string>
  <string id="6109066">Eliminate the Carta thugs who are trying to kill Lord Renvil Harrowmont. They are lurking throughout the Docks.</string>
  <string id="6109069">Kill Lord Renvil Harrowmont, and collect a reward from the Carta.</string>

  <string id="6109072">Lord Renvil Harrowmont was killed. Report back to the Carta to collect a reward.</string>
  <string id="6109077">The Carta thugs were eliminated, and Lord Renvil Harrowmont escaped the city.</string>

  <string id="6109092">For all your talk, you're no better than I am, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6109095">Aaah!</string>
  <string id="6109098">I just wanted to see my mum. No one ever told her where they were taking me.</string>
  <string id="6109101">No. No, this is their place. We cannot—</string>
  <string id="6109104">So, you admit your attempted escape? You know what happens to mage girls who don't toe the line around here, don't you?</string>
  <string id="6109107">Please, no! Don't make me Tranquil! I'll do anything!</string>
  <string id="6109110">That's right. Once you're Tranquil, you'll do anything I ask.</string>
  <string id="6109111">What are you doing to that girl?</string>
  <string id="6109112">What's going on here?</string>
  <string id="6109113">The Chantry frowns on templars who take personal advantage of their charges.</string>
  <string id="6109114">Naughty, naughty.</string>
  <string id="6109115">Who's this?</string>
  <string id="6109118">Get your hands off her!</string>
  <string id="6109119">Die!</string>
  <string id="6109123">There was a time when the rules of the Order could be... interpreted to suit a situation. Unlike these days.</string>
  <string id="6109125">Oh, look who's here! Trying to save the world again? Don't worry, I've got it covered this time.</string>
  <string id="6109127">From the magistrate's vague description, I expected a hardened criminal, not a whining coward.</string>
  <string id="6109128">You aren't what I expected.</string>
  <string id="6109132">They will not have you.</string>

  <string id="6109216">Have a seat, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6109217">Step into my office, serah. Let's talk.</string>
  <string id="6109218">Maker protect us all.</string>
  <string id="6109219">I hope Mother convinces the viscount to give us the estate.</string>
  <string id="6109220">I wish we had the money for our own place.</string>
  <string id="6109224">Can we talk the next time we're home? I have something to tell you.</string>
  <string id="6109225">Let's wait until we're home.</string>
  <string id="6109226">This isn't the place to talk. Let's go home when we have a chance.</string>
  <string id="6109227">We should talk at home.</string>
  <string id="6109228">I miss the chantry in Lothering. Sister Leliana told the best stories.</string>
  <string id="6109229">Do you remember what that awful Qunari did in Lothering? I'm nervous having so many here.</string>
  <string id="6109230">Hightown is so grand compared to Lothering. It's hard to think we might have lived here.</string>
  <string id="6109231">I just can't get used to all the noise in Lowtown. And the smell. What a come-down for Mother to be here.</string>
  <string id="6109232">Let's leave. This place makes me uncomfortable.</string>
  <string id="6109233">We shouldn't talk here.</string>
  <string id="6109234">Barks</string>
  <string id="6109237">Soon, Mother. For now, I feel better knowing he's here protecting you.</string>
  <string id="6109238">Let's try to make do.</string>
  <string id="6109239">I'm sure Uncle Gamlen would like nothing more than to be rid of us.</string>
  <string id="6109240">Don't let Gamlen hear you.</string>
  <string id="6109241">This is our lot for now. Maybe you should try to improve it instead of complaining.</string>
  <string id="6109242">Make it work.</string>
  <string id="6109243">You backstabber!</string>
  <string id="6109244">It was worth it, if only to see the look on your face.</string>
  <string id="6109249">Oh... Chuckles I see how it is. This is payback, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6109252">It won't be that easy. You have to fight me first.</string>
  <string id="6109254">Harrowmont can't wait forever.</string>
  <string id="6109257">I remember your father. Malcolm was a good man.</string>
  <string id="6109260">I will send the letters I held. It seems fitting that they return to family.</string>
  <string id="6109266">Such a friendship. Few like your father remain.</string>
  <string id="6109285">I might not wish to be cooped up here, either!</string>
  <string id="6109286">I suppose I could take him for a stroll. What an odd sight we'll make, a mother and her mabari. </string>

  <string id="6109322">Happy bark!</string>
  <string id="6109325">You will not have him!</string>
  <string id="6109330">Not today.</string>
  <string id="6109360">Varterral Hunting Ground</string>
  <string id="6109361">Sundermount</string>
  <string id="6109364">And that might kill me as surely as the templars.</string>
  <string id="6109368">Grunts</string>
  <string id="6109371">No! no! no!</string>
  <string id="6109374">They will not have us, Wesley.</string>
  <string id="6109377">Not while I breathe.</string>
  <string id="6109378">Back!</string>
  <string id="6109381">Back, back, back!</string>
  <string id="6109384">Stand, love. You must!</string>
  <string id="6109387">And I will stand with you.</string>
  <string id="6109390">See for yourself. The legacy of the magisters.</string>
  <string id="6109393">They sacrifice the unwilling?</string>
  <string id="6109396">Is that so hard to believe? You are only a step away from it, yourself.</string>
  <string id="6109399">That's not true.</string>
  <string id="6109402">Believe what you like. In my experience, mages always find a way to justify their need for power.</string>
  <string id="6109403">Blood magic.</string>
  <string id="6109406">Is this... allowed in Tevinter?</string>
  <string id="6109409">They kill the slaves for their blood.</string>
  <string id="6109412">Blood magic?</string>
  <string id="6109415">In a society where mages rule, they find many ways to justify their need for power.</string>
  <string id="6109418">They're still here. Good.</string>
  <string id="6109421">We must be careful.</string>
  <string id="6109424">There were many such holdings once, especially in the mountains, where individual slavers kept private pens.</string>
  <string id="6109427">They were designed to protect against raids by fellow slavers. No doubt it's why Hadriana chose this place.</string>
  <string id="6109428">Do slavers attack each other often?</string>
  <string id="6109429">Raids by fellow slavers?</string>
  <string id="6109430">They did. What better way to find slaves than to steal them?</string>
  <string id="6109433">The holdings outside of Tevinter have mostly been abandoned, but they still exist.</string>
  <string id="6109434">A few protections won't stop us.</string>
  <string id="6109435">We have nothing to fear.</string>
  <string id="6109436">Hadriana won't escape us.</string>
  <string id="6109437">We'll find her, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6109438">Maybe she wanted to redecorate. Add a few flowers.</string>
  <string id="6109439">I'm sure it's lovely.</string>
  <string id="6109440">She's not a flowers kind of woman.</string>
  <string id="6109443">Let's hope this isn't a waste of time.</string>
  <string id="6109446">Radha's Body</string>
  <string id="6109453">Merrill's Home</string>
  <string id="6109455">Merrill</string>
  <string id="6109457">Merrill's Home</string>
  <string id="6109459">Merrill</string>
  <string id="6109551">Everything here is cold, hard stone. I wish I'd worn shoes with soles, now.</string>
  <string id="6109557">It's so quiet here after dark.</string>
  <string id="6109560">Last of His Line</string>
  <string id="6109566">Hawke,&#13;
I do not know if you remember me, but you helped me deal with the Carta a few years ago. Given the generally disreputable characters in Kirkwall, I had all but given up hope, and I swore I would reward you properly. Take these coins and the enclosed package.&#13;
&#13;
My men and I are preparing to leave Rivain before King Bhelen's assassins catch up with us again. If the Stone favors us, we'll find Kal-Sharok and safety soon. If the Harrowmonts survive this dire time, your name and deeds will be recorded in the memories.&#13;
&#13;
With respect,&#13;
Renvil Harrowmont</string>
  <string id="6109596">Maybe later... we could talk? Back at my house, I mean. I'll clean, I promise!</string>
  <string id="6109631">It's ruining your life. Let it go.</string>
  <string id="6109634">Blood magic and exile were my choice! The eluvian had nothing to do with it!</string>
  <string id="6109635">I don't know what the arulin'holm can do, but I know you can't be responsible for it.</string>
  <string id="6109636">I don't trust you with it.</string>
  <string id="6109681">Are you hurt? Did they touch you?</string>
  <string id="6109684">They've been killing everyone! They cut papa, bled him...</string>
  <string id="6109687">Why? Why would they do this?</string>
  <string id="6109690">The magister... she said she needed power, that someone was coming to kill her.</string>
  <string id="6109696">We tried to be good! We did everything we were told! She loved papa's soup. I don't understand...</string>
  <string id="6109697">Is the magister still here?</string>
  <string id="6109698">Where is Hadriana?</string>
  <string id="6109699">I... think so.</string>
  <string id="6109702">The magister said they were to prepare for battle. I think she's very frightened!</string>
  <string id="6109705">She has every reason to be.</string>
  <string id="6109708">Please, don't hurt her! She'll be so angry if you hurt her!</string>
  <string id="6109709">This has been terrible for you.</string>
  <string id="6109710">I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6109711">Let's not waste more time. We need to find Hadriana.</string>
  <string id="6109712">We don't need this.</string>
  <string id="6109713">You're just a slave to them—property to be used.</string>
  <string id="6109714">They don't care about you.</string>
  <string id="6109715">Everything was fine until today!</string>
  <string id="6109718">It wasn't. You just didn't know any better.</string>
  <string id="6109721">Are you my master now?</string>
  <string id="6109724">No.</string>
  <string id="6109727">But... I can cook. I can clean! What else will I do?</string>
  <string id="6109729">Take this coin and go.</string>
  <string id="6109730">Here. Now go.</string>
  <string id="6109733">This might help you start a new life.</string>
  <string id="6109736">Consider this my donation to the cause.</string>
  <string id="6109739">For me? Thank you! I... I'll treasure it forever!</string>
  <string id="6109743">Not our problem.</string>
  <string id="6109744">This isn't our concern. Just go.</string>
  <string id="6109747">Do whatever you have to.</string>
  <string id="6109750">Do we look like slavers? Go on.</string>
  <string id="6109753">I'm sorry! I didn't mean to be bad!</string>
  <string id="6109756">If you go to Kirkwall, I can help you.</string>
  <string id="6109757">Come work for me.</string>
  <string id="6109758">Yes? Oh, praise the Maker! Thank you!</string>
  <string id="6109764">I didn't realize you were in the market for a slave.</string>
  <string id="6109765">I gave her a job, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6109766">I will pay her.</string>
  <string id="6109767">Ah. Then... that's good. My apologies.</string>
  <string id="6109770">I don't see why that's any of your business.</string>
  <string id="6109771">Slaves are useful.</string>
  <string id="6109772">Evidently not.</string>
  <string id="6109775">She'll probably be robbed before the day is through.</string>
  <string id="6109778">Let's find Hadriana and be done with this place.</string>
  <string id="6109784">Please! For the love of mercy, help me!</string>
  <string id="6109786">It's not dangerous! I cleansed the corruption! </string>
  <string id="6109788">I'm not a child asking for a puppy! I've trained my entire life to be a Keeper!</string>
  <string id="6109792">Why do you always win at cards?</string>
  <string id="6109795">Because I cheat, Kitten. Chuckles</string>
  <string id="6109798">This trinket... it's elven, isn't it? From your clan.</string>
  <string id="6109804">Don't bet anything you're not prepared to lose. Here... have it back.</string>
  <string id="6109811">Varterral Hunting Ground</string>
  <string id="6109828">Even fewer like the templar. Rest well at the Maker's side, Ser Maurevar Carver.</string>
  <string id="6109840">Fools!</string>
  <string id="6109841">I have prepared for you!</string>
  <string id="6109842">You cannot win here!</string>
  <string id="6109843">You should not have come!</string>
  <string id="6109844">Kaffar!</string>
  <string id="6109848">Attack this one, you idiots!</string>
  <string id="6109849">Attack my foe!</string>
  <string id="6109853">Gather around me!</string>
  <string id="6109858">It seems I'll have to use something else!</string>
  <string id="6109863">I need a potion!</string>
  <string id="6109873">What holds me?</string>
  <string id="6109883">I have nothing left!</string>
  <string id="6109884">Why is this taking so long?</string>
  <string id="6109888">No! It cannot end like this!</string>
  <string id="6109889">Too much!</string>
  <string id="6109894">I hope you rot!</string>
  <string id="6109895">There! We have them!</string>
  <string id="6109899">It does nothing?</string>
  <string id="6109904">You cannot evade me!</string>
  <string id="6109909">Attack the mage!</string>
  <string id="6109914">The archer! The archer!</string>
  <string id="6109919">Fenedhis!</string>
  <string id="6109975">Varterral Hunting Ground</string>
  <string id="6109983">You and the Keeper may not like it, but I chose this path with my eyes open.</string>
  <string id="6109991">Everything I do, everything I've ever done, was for the good of my people. Don't talk to me about responsibility.</string>
  <string id="6109996">Sundermount</string>
  <string id="6109998">It's only a tool. It's no more good or evil than a hammer or a sword.</string>
  <string id="6110000">He... wasn't always like this.</string>
  <string id="6110003">Giggles</string>
  <string id="6110004">Vishante!</string>
  <string id="6110008">Stop! You do not want me dead.</string>
  <string id="6110011">There is only one person I want dead more.</string>
  <string id="6110015">You've made a terrible mistake coming here, slave!</string>
  <string id="6110018">Not as much as you have, witch!</string>
  <string id="6110032">Men. Grunts You have to be twice as tough to earn half as much respect.</string>
  <string id="6110038">So did the crew member mutiny? I mean, after... you know...</string>
  <string id="6110041">Chuckles Oh, no. I had the offending member removed. That got rid of the attitude.</string>
  <string id="6110047">I can't believe I've been such an idiot, believing you'd help me. Go. I'd rather be alone.</string>
  <string id="6110051">We should talk when I'm home.</string>
  <string id="6110052">It's no longer safe for me to speak in public. Let's talk at my clinic.</string>
  <string id="6110053">We should speak privately when you have a chance.</string>
  <string id="6110054">I would talk... somewhere we cannot be overheard. Come to my clinic when you can.</string>
  <string id="6110057">I shouldn't be seen here.</string>
  <string id="6110058">How can people who serve the Maker allow their own templars such abuses?</string>
  <string id="6110059">I'm not getting many cases these days. I think most of the refugees have cleared out.</string>
  <string id="6110062">Either they found jobs. Or they're dead.</string>
  <string id="6110063">Qunari give me the creeps. No one is that dedicated to some abstract ideal.</string>
  <string id="6110064">I don't know whether to cherish every moment I am with you, or fear for your life to have me there.</string>
  <string id="6110065">I never thought you would still be with me.</string>
  <string id="6110066">We should get going.</string>
  <string id="6110071">He allowed your father to leave Kirkwall. Rule is not served by caging the best of us. A wise man.</string>
  <string id="6110072">Hard to believe that a mage could have any sort of friendship with a templar.</string>
  <string id="6110073">My father trusted him?</string>
  <string id="6110074">That is the distrust of today—a reflex that now restrains more than it protects.</string>
  <string id="6110075">Not what I would expect from a templar.</string>
  <string id="6110076">That's surprising.</string>
  <string id="6110079">Carver? Well, well. Something to discuss back at the house.</string>
  <string id="6110088">Sounds like he didn't quite understand the job.</string>
  <string id="6110089">So he was a bad templar.</string>
  <string id="6110090">Doubt can serve the faithful, even as it vexes them. I fear this has been lost.</string>
  <string id="6110095">Chandan's Amulet</string>
  <string id="6110116">The knight-commander is out of control. Even her own people have been talking about it.</string>
  <string id="6110119">Is that... making it harder for you? With Justice?</string>
  <string id="6110120">How are you handling it?</string>
  <string id="6110121">If they want you, they'll have to come through me.</string>
  <string id="6110122">I'll keep you safe.</string>
  <string id="6110123">Why do they keep fighting? If they obeyed the Chantry's laws, the templars would leave them alone.</string>
  <string id="6110124">The mages should submit.</string>
  <string id="6110127">I never imagined a human would help me restore Dalish history.</string>
  <string id="6110130">Harshal's Amulet</string>
  <string id="6110134">Radha's Amulet</string>
  <string id="6110152">Well, that's good. She always seemed a little lonely.</string>
  <string id="6110155">But of course. Just don't let Merrill catch you saying that.</string>
  <string id="6110158">I get the feeling the girl's messing in something big and dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6110166">Varterral</string>
  <string id="6110170">Spider</string>
  <string id="6110172">Fine, be that way.</string>
  <string id="6110175">Look out for her, will you? Make sure she doesn't hurt herself.</string>
  <string id="6110178">Oh, and if you do anything nasty to her, I'll cut off your balls.</string>
  <string id="6110184">Sighs I wish Merrill had chosen a different path. I didn't want it to come to this.</string>
  <string id="6110211">I can't imagine you married.</string>
  <string id="6110212">You were married?</string>
  <string id="6110213">You're an expert on Rivaini talismans, are you?</string>
  <string id="6110214">You know much about talismans?</string>
  <string id="6110215">My mother was a Rivaini seer. Or rather, she pretended to be.</string>
  <string id="6110218">She knew enough about the old tribal practices to put on a convincing act.</string>
  <string id="6110221">She used to hand these things out to women all the time.</string>
  <string id="6110224">Laughs I was his plaything. A prized possession.</string>
  <string id="6110227">He saw me with my mother at the market in Llomerryn and decided he had to have me.</string>
  <string id="6110244">My mother gave me away for a goat and a handful of gold coins. She didn't even haggle over the price!</string>
  <string id="6110247">Bitch.</string>
  <string id="6110251">Your marriage was loveless, and you've never experienced true love?</string>
  <string id="6110252">Have you never been in love?</string>
  <string id="6110256">He foolishly asked for my hand. I refused to be tied down again, and I fled.</string>
  <string id="6110257">Wait. You're not thinking of bringing feelings into this, are you?</string>
  <string id="6110258">What about love?</string>
  <string id="6110259">Why not?</string>
  <string id="6110260">I'm sorry you feel that way.</string>
  <string id="6110261">That's a shame.</string>
  <string id="6110262">Why? I'm not.</string>
  <string id="6110265">It's not always up to you. Love can be pretty persistent.</string>
  <string id="6110266">The choice may not be yours.</string>
  <string id="6110267">I don't care. It can go pester someone else.</string>
  <string id="6110270">Emotions complicate things.</string>
  <string id="6110271">Fair enough.</string>
  <string id="6110272">Exactly.</string>
  <string id="6110275">How were you freed from the marriage?</string>
  <string id="6110276">What happened to your husband?</string>
  <string id="6110277">My husband took an assassin's blade to the back of the skull.</string>
  <string id="6110280">And before you start jumping to conclusions, no, I didn't hire the assassin.</string>
  <string id="6110286">I did thank him profusely, however. Ah, Zevran. He was an artist.</string>
  <string id="6110287">No. I... look, it isn't like that. It's just easier this way.</string>
  <string id="6110290">I know what I said. And I know why I said it.</string>
  <string id="6110293">You were right. I wasn't afraid of love. I was afraid of being loved.</string>
  <string id="6110297">Thank you for waiting.</string>
  <string id="6110300">It was worth it.</string>
  <string id="6110305">I should have expected he'd send you, Cousin.</string>
  <string id="6110319">Sorry to interrupt this touching family reunion, but we have unfinished business here.</string>
  <string id="6110360">Guard captain means nothing in here.</string>
  <string id="6110361">There was enough trouble in Lothering with one Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6110362">They respect no authority but their own. It's coincidence that Qunari order matches our law.</string>
  <string id="6110365">I'm uncomfortable around Chantry sisters. All because of that red-haired trickster in Lothering.</string>
  <string id="6110366">I should feel more at home here, but... I know sacrifice, but I will not be a sacrifice.</string>
  <string id="6110369">I have information, elf, and I will trade it in return for my life.</string>
  <string id="6110372">The location of Danarius? What good will that do me? I'd rather he lose his pet pupil.</string>
  <string id="6110375">You have a sister. She is alive.</string>
  <string id="6110381">You wish to reclaim your life? Let me go, and I will tell you where she is.</string>
  <string id="6110382">How do we know you're even telling the truth?</string>
  <string id="6110383">You could be lying.</string>
  <string id="6110384">You don't.</string>
  <string id="6110387">But I know Fenris, and I know what he's searching for. If he wants me to betray Danarius, he'll have to pay for it.</string>
  <string id="6110388">This is your call.</string>
  <string id="6110389">It's up to you, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6110390">We'll find his sister, and then we'll let you go. Not before.</string>
  <string id="6110391">Tell us first.</string>
  <string id="6110392">Ha! You think I'm a fool?</string>
  <string id="6110395">The woman is in the Imperium. I will not stay captive the entire time it would take for you to find her!</string>
  <string id="6110398">You want to know who you were, Fenris? Then let me go.</string>
  <string id="6110400">We'll let you go.</string>
  <string id="6110401">Tell us what you know.</string>
  <string id="6110404">If this is the only way Fenris gets his answers, then very well.</string>
  <string id="6110407">Looks like you're getting your wish, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6110411">We can't trust you.</string>
  <string id="6110412">Forget it. You're not going anywhere.</string>
  <string id="6110415">Just another trap. I can't risk it.</string>
  <string id="6110418">You must be joking! That's the flimsiest deal I've heard yet.</string>
  <string id="6110421">No!</string>
  <string id="6110427">So I have your word? I tell you, and you let me go?</string>
  <string id="6110430">Yes. You have my word.</string>
  <string id="6110433">Her name is Varania. She is in Qarinus serving a magister by the name of Ahriman.</string>
  <string id="6110436">A servant. Not a slave.</string>
  <string id="6110439">She's not a slave.</string>
  <string id="6110442">I believe you.</string>
  <string id="6110445">Gasps</string>
  <string id="6110448">We are done here.</string>
  <string id="6110450">But you gave your word!</string>
  <string id="6110452">She deserved to die.</string>
  <string id="6110453">We can't be sure she was telling the truth.</string>
  <string id="6110454">What if she was lying?</string>
  <string id="6110460">Hey, Donnic, whose pucker have you been greasing to get Hightown?</string>
  <string id="6110469">You have got to be kidding me. What did I do to get that post?</string>
  <string id="6110470">What? You're daft. I'm working those skinnings across town.</string>
  <string id="6110475">Good things are always happening to that bastard.</string>
  <string id="6110476">Right funny it is, how favors spring up around here.</string>
  <string id="6110477">Clear off now, all right?</string>
  <string id="6110481">Donnic beds the captain and he gets tougher patrols?</string>
  <string id="6110484">Boy should climb a little hill now and then.</string>
  <string id="6110485">Donnic and the captain. Well now.</string>
  <string id="6110489">Getting a few looks in here. Hope it's because I'm a guard.</string>
  <string id="6110490">Not the best place for the captain of the guard to be seen, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6110493">I don't know why anyone would embarrass me with a patrol like this.</string>
  <string id="6110496">Guarding the market? Is that all the captain thinks I'm worth?</string>
  <string id="6110501">Guardsman Donnic.</string>
  <string id="6110506">Hello, Serah Hawke. As always, good to see you.</string>
  <string id="6110512">Hawke? What a surprise. What are you doing here?</string>
  <string id="6110513">Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6110516">Hawke. Don't.</string>
  <string id="6110517">So much for not killing her.</string>
  <string id="6110520">You said you wouldn't kill her!</string>
  <string id="6110523">Not big on keeping promises, I take it?</string>
  <string id="6110526">Spits That's what her bloody deal was worth!</string>
  <string id="6110529">You beat me to it.</string>
  <string id="6110532">You did what you had to.</string>
  <string id="6110535">Another negotiation won. Good job, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6110538">Oh, you think that was a good idea?</string>
  <string id="6110541">Of course we can't be sure!</string>
  <string id="6110544">Do you want to talk about it?</string>
  <string id="6110545">Are you all right?</string>
  <string id="6110546">No, I don't want to talk about it!</string>
  <string id="6110549">This could be a trap! Danarius could have sent Hadriana here to tell me about this sister.</string>
  <string id="6110552">Even if he didn't, trying to find her would still be suicide! Danarius has to know about her and has to know that Hadriana knows.</string>
  <string id="6110555">But all that matters is I finally got to crush this bitch's heart. May she rot and all the other mages with her.</string>
  <string id="6110556">Maybe we should leave...</string>
  <string id="6110557">I'm sorry, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6110558">Don't comfort me.</string>
  <string id="6110561">No. I don't want you comforting me.</string>
  <string id="6110564">This doesn't mean we shouldn't look for your sister.</string>
  <string id="6110565">We can still find her.</string>
  <string id="6110566">What else should it mean?</string>
  <string id="6110569">And who's going to look for her? You?</string>
  <string id="6110572">We should go, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6110573">Let's get out of here.</string>
  <string id="6110574">Go where? Back to Kirkwall? Don't make me laugh.</string>
  <string id="6110577">No. I don't want to go anywhere with you.</string>
  <string id="6110581">Watch what you say about mages.</string>
  <string id="6110582">Let's not forget who you're talking to.</string>
  <string id="6110585">I haven't forgotten.</string>
  <string id="6110588">You know damned well they're not all like your magisters.</string>
  <string id="6110591">And who should be our example? Anders? Merrill?</string>
  <string id="6110594">Being a blood mage does not mean sacrificing innocents!</string>
  <string id="6110597">There are worse examples.</string>
  <string id="6110600">You saw what was done here. There's always going to be some reason, some excuse why mages need to do this.</string>
  <string id="6110603">Even if I found my sister, who knows what the magisters have done to her. What has magic touched that it doesn't spoil?</string>
  <string id="6110606">I... need to go.</string>
  <string id="6110609">Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6110612">Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6110615">You tried. Sort of. Time to open your eyes and see who really cares for you.</string>
  <string id="6110616">He's not the one. Can't you see?</string>
  <string id="6110617">I think you'll come around once it's all out in the open.</string>
  <string id="6110618">You'll thank me later.</string>
  <string id="6110619">We don't have all night, you know.</string>
  <string id="6110620">No more stalling.</string>
  <string id="6110621">Would someone please tell me what's going on?</string>
  <string id="6110624">You're a daft couple of... Take a hint and bend her over a basin, will you?</string>
  <string id="6110627">All right, I'm going to draw a picture of where she wants to touch you.</string>
  <string id="6110630">You two are adorable! Kiss him already!</string>
  <string id="6110633">Are you blind, man? Kiss her already!</string>
  <string id="6110636">She wants you. It is pathetic... and admirable.</string>
  <string id="6110642">She likes you. Stop being so damned coy, both of you.</string>
  <string id="6110643">You don't need me to say it. You'd have to be willfully blind not to see it now.</string>
  <string id="6110647">Captain?</string>
  <string id="6110650">Laughs</string>
  <string id="6110657">I... should get back to the barracks.</string>
  <string id="6110667">I've been thinking about what happened with Hadriana.</string>
  <string id="6110670">I took out my anger on you, undeservedly so. I was... not myself. I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6110671">I thought we were friends.</string>
  <string id="6110674">Friends sometimes push.</string>
  <string id="6110690">You...</string>
  <string id="6110693">And you...</string>
  <string id="6110696">Hmm?</string>
  <string id="6110697">Explicit gesture?</string>
  <string id="6110700">So this route's pretty quiet.</string>
  <string id="6110703">Heh, yes, as I say.</string>
  <string id="6110706">Maker, she's bad at this.</string>
  <string id="6110709">Well, Guardsman, good patrol. I think we're done, and I...</string>
  <string id="6110712">If it isn't done right, the blade can be too soft. Quenching the steel is a vital step that can make or break a sword.</string>
  <string id="6110715">Right.</string>
  <string id="6110718">A blade for every purpose. What do you think? About blades?</string>
  <string id="6110721">I'm sorry, Captain. I drifted off a bit.</string>
  <string id="6110724">Right. Of course.</string>
  <string id="6110727">Ugh. Painful.</string>
  <string id="6110730">Yes, and it's... a real nice night for an evening.</string>
  <string id="6110733">Uh, as you say, Captain.</string>
  <string id="6110739">I... you go first. I'll be right there. Just... don't tell him this is about me!</string>
  <string id="6110748">There were supposed to be others coming, right?</string>
  <string id="6110754">Right. Look, I should really...</string>
  <string id="6110766">I mean, how sad would it be if you needed a go-between? Have some backbone.</string>
  <string id="6110769">All this playing shy business? I like a little backbone.</string>
  <string id="6110783">You and I don't always see eye to eye, but that doesn't mean you deserved my anger. I owe you an apology.</string>
  <string id="6110784">I had no idea where you went, I was concerned.</string>
  <string id="6110785">I was worried about you.</string>
  <string id="6110786">I needed to be alone.</string>
  <string id="6110789">That's it? Just an apology?</string>
  <string id="6110790">You were out of line.</string>
  <string id="6110791">If you wish, I can go. You need not see me again.</string>
  <string id="6110792">That's not necessary.</string>
  <string id="6110793">No.</string>
  <string id="6110794">I'm relieved.</string>
  <string id="6110797">I think it's time we parted ways.</string>
  <string id="6110798">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6110799">Ah. I hoped it wouldn't come to this.</string>
  <string id="6110802">Perhaps you're right.</string>
  <string id="6110805">May fortune continue to smile on you, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6110808">All I want is to know what happened in there.</string>
  <string id="6110809">I want an explanation.</string>
  <string id="6110810">There's no need to apologize.</string>
  <string id="6110811">I understand.</string>
  <string id="6110812">People take their frustrations out on me all the time.</string>
  <string id="6110813">That's what I'm here for.</string>
  <string id="6110814">You are generous.</string>
  <string id="6110817">When I was still a slave, Hadriana was a torment. She would ridicule me, deny my meals, hound my sleep.</string>
  <string id="6110820">Because of her status, I was powerless to respond and she knew it.</string>
  <string id="6110823">The thought of her slipping out of my grasp now... I couldn't let her go. I wanted to, but I couldn't.</string>
  <string id="6110824">That's more important than your promise?</string>
  <string id="6110825">You gave your word.</string>
  <string id="6110826">It's not easy to discover your principles are less noble than you believed.</string>
  <string id="6110829">I'm glad you killed her, then.</string>
  <string id="6110830">She deserved to die.</string>
  <string id="6110831">I should be happy now that Hadriana is dead. Instead, I feel nothing but... disquiet.</string>
  <string id="6110834">What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="6110835">You wanted to?</string>
  <string id="6110836">This hate... I thought I'd gotten away from it. But it dogs me no matter where I go.</string>
  <string id="6110839">To feel it again, to know it was they who planted it inside me... it was too much to bear.</string>
  <string id="6110842">But I didn't come here to burden you further.</string>
  <string id="6110843">You don't need to leave, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6110844">Don't go.</string>
  <string id="6110850">It's not a burden.</string>
  <string id="6110851">We're friends, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6110854">I'm not certain I know what that is.</string>
  <string id="6110855">I can help you.</string>
  <string id="6110858">I don't think anyone can help me.</string>
  <string id="6110859">We'll talk again some other time.</string>
  <string id="6110860">Maybe you should go.</string>
  <string id="6110861">An excellent idea.</string>
  <string id="6110862">Your need for revenge is consuming you.</string>
  <string id="6110863">You need to let your past go.</string>
  <string id="6110864">Admit it. You just wanted to kill her.</string>
  <string id="6110865">You're making excuses.</string>
  <string id="6110866">You clearly weren't thinking about finding your family when you did it.</string>
  <string id="6110867">What about your sister?</string>
  <string id="6110868">And what would you have me do?</string>
  <string id="6110871">Hadriana came after me! I have never had the option to simply walk away.</string>
  <string id="6110874">Am I supposed to forgive, no matter how many times they hunt me down? Am I supposed to forget all the things they've done to me?</string>
  <string id="6110875">You may not wear chains anymore, but you're not free.</string>
  <string id="6110876">You're still a slave.</string>
  <string id="6110877">You know nothing of being a slave!</string>
  <string id="6110880">If you're wondering why you can't move on, this is it.</string>
  <string id="6110881">It's eating you up, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6110882">Yes, this is it! Why can I not grasp something so simple?</string>
  <string id="6110885">They say amnesia is a friend to the tormented.</string>
  <string id="6110886">Sounds like a plan.</string>
  <string id="6110887">A friend! I don't have any friends!</string>
  <string id="6110890">It's a sickness, this hate. This dark growth inside me that I can't ever get rid of, and they put it there!</string>
  <string id="6110893">Sighs This... isn't why I came here.</string>
  <string id="6110894">You don't need to leave, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6110895">Don't go.</string>
  <string id="6110896">I think it would be best for both of us if I did.</string>
  <string id="6110897">So you're just going to leave?</string>
  <string id="6110898">Is that it?</string>
  <string id="6110906">I'm trying to help you.</string>
  <string id="6110907">Just think about what I've said.</string>
  <string id="6110910">You can't do this alone, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6110913">Stop being so bloody stubborn.</string>
  <string id="6110916">Easier said than done.</string>
  <string id="6110917">You need to cool down.</string>
  <string id="6110918">Maybe you should go.</string>
  <string id="6110919">No doubt you are right.</string>
  <string id="6110920">Are you going to use the information Hadriana gave you?</string>
  <string id="6110921">What about your family?</string>
  <string id="6110922">I don't know yet. I will have to think on it.</string>
  <string id="6110935">You change your mind about helping the werewolves? Without help, they'll all go wild.</string>
  <string id="6110945">You dare ask for more help?</string>
  <string id="6110948">You've done more for me than I have any right to expect. But I don't even know what some of the things on this list are.</string>
  <string id="6110951">If I were the Keeper, you wouldn't even have that list. Your family murdered Zathrian and his entire tribe.</string>
  <string id="6110954">They weren't themselves. They were cursed. And each day more lose themselves to the beast.</string>
  <string id="6110955">Sorry to interrupt.</string>
  <string id="6110956">I'll just leave.</string>
  <string id="6110957">What's this about curses? And beasts?</string>
  <string id="6110958">What are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="6110959">This shemlen speaks for the werewolves of the Brecilian Forest. She represents murderers!</string>
  <string id="6110962">And saviors, too. They fought at the Battle of Denerim with the Hero of Ferelden.</string>
  <string id="6110965">But now they're losing hold of their senses. Even the Lady of the Forest is growing wild.</string>
  <string id="6110968">If you don't help soon, they'll be nothing but monsters. And then, then you'll see murders.</string>
  <string id="6110971">We are done.</string>
  <string id="6110972">You've come a long way to help werewolves. You're not one of them, are you?</string>
  <string id="6110973">Why help werewolves?</string>
  <string id="6110974">Me? No. But my cousin Jasiah is.</string>
  <string id="6110977">He was missing for years. We thought he was dead. But he came back after the Blight.</string>
  <string id="6110980">He was a hero, of sorts. But now... he's slowly losing his mind.</string>
  <string id="6110981">The Dalish said the werewolves killed Zathrian. And his entire tribe.</string>
  <string id="6110982">Werewolves murdered Dalish?</string>
  <string id="6110983">We heard a Dalish tribe was killed in the forest. I didn't know werewolves did that until I came here.</string>
  <string id="6110986">Keeper Marethari told me. She said Zathrian was at fault, too. That's all I know.</string>
  <string id="6110987">If I can help keep the werewolves from turning to beasts, I will.</string>
  <string id="6110988">Tell me how I can help.</string>
  <string id="6110989">Thank you. The curse can't be broken, but it can be slowed.</string>
  <string id="6110992">The Keeper gave me a list of ingredients, but some will be difficult and dangerous to find.</string>
  <string id="6110995">Please, help me find them.</string>
  <string id="6111001">Even if I could, I'm not sure I'd want to help werewolves.</string>
  <string id="6111002">I'm not getting involved.</string>
  <string id="6111006">I found all the ingredients, Clara.</string>
  <string id="6111009">I knew you'd come through! Take this.</string>
  <string id="6111012">I need to go. Before it's too late!</string>
  <string id="6111015">The Dalish won't help find the ingredients. There's only you.</string>
  <string id="6111016">If you change your mind...</string>
  <string id="6111028">Clara</string>
  <string id="6111032">Dalish Hunter</string>
  <string id="6111035">Changing One's Nature</string>
  <string id="6111037">Clara went to the Dalish elves in Sundermount to find a cure for the werewolves in the Brecilian Forest. She needs: an alchemically sealed flask, purified deathroot, twice-distilled quicksilver, and ebon rathleek (a rare poison).</string>
  <string id="6111038">Some of the ingredients to help with Clara's werewolf curse are acquired, but more remain to be found. She needs: an alchemically sealed flask, purified deathroot, twice-distilled quicksilver, and ebon rathleek (a rare poison).</string>
  <string id="6111039">All of the ingredients needed to help cure the werewolf curse are acquired. Go back to the Dalish elf camp in Sundermount and talk with Clara.</string>
  <string id="6111040">Clara provided a reward for finding the ingredients to help with the werewolf curse. Hopefully some lives will be saved.</string>
  <string id="6111045">Qunari</string>
  <string id="6111047">Look for Yevhen's sons in the Deep Roads.</string>
  <string id="6111049">Plans change, apparently.</string>
  <string id="6111052">Just... give it a moment.</string>
  <string id="6111055">What? No, sit, drink.</string>
  <string id="6111058">Search the Deep Roads for Emrys, Iwan, and Merin.</string>
  <string id="6111060">Either help Iwan get his weapon or rescue Merin from the darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6111065">Merin was rescued. Perhaps Iwan and the weapon can still be found.</string>
  <string id="6111066">Use the golem to get to the treasure cache.</string>
  <string id="6111069">Guardsman Donnic. You're free for an evening?</string>
  <string id="6111070">Serah Donnic, are you free? I need to ask you something.</string>
  <string id="6111073">Guardsman Donnic! How are you?</string>
  <string id="6111074">In the Fade, there is no time. Emotion rules everything. Justice doesn't know how to sit idle until the right moment to strike.</string>
  <string id="6111080">And I can't say I have any greater patience. I fear what my anger has made of my friend.</string>
  <string id="6111081">You chose to merge with him. Only you can make it work.</string>
  <string id="6111082">You have to control it.</string>
  <string id="6111083">I am trying.</string>
  <string id="6111086">I have not attacked the templars openly. I've helped the mages here as best I can. But this impasse cannot last.</string>
  <string id="6111089">There will be more violence. I know that. If you tie yourself to me, I'll only hurt you.</string>
  <string id="6111090">What's the worst that can happen? You turn into an abomination and start... never mind. Bad joke.</string>
  <string id="6111091">It'll be fine.</string>
  <string id="6111092">My control is fraying. I cannot hold back Justice—or whatever creature he has become—much longer.</string>
  <string id="6111095">You may split hairs over what sort of spirit lives in you. But it seems more demonic every day.</string>
  <string id="6111096">You are an abomination.</string>
  <string id="6111097">Justice is no demon! He is an ideal that men have striven to reach and never managed.</string>
  <string id="6111100">Just being with me puts you at risk.</string>
  <string id="6111103">The knight-commander has declared supporting apostates a hanging offense. The thought of them hurting you...</string>
  <string id="6111109">You're at as much risk as I am.</string>
  <string id="6111112">That's what I worry. What if your money and position aren't enough? What if the knight-commander turns on you?</string>
  <string id="6111118">Everything I've done to control this... I don't care. I would drown us in blood to keep you safe.</string>
  <string id="6111119">I don't want to see you lose yourself... to the templars or Justice.</string>
  <string id="6111120">Stay in control.</string>
  <string id="6111121">You don't think we should start with flowers... jewelry?</string>
  <string id="6111122">You're so romantic.</string>
  <string id="6111123">I won't lose you to this.</string>
  <string id="6111124">Don't risk yourself.</string>
  <string id="6111128">This is your fight, too.</string>
  <string id="6111129">The world needs to see men like you. Who do not fear to stand openly at a mage's side.</string>
  <string id="6111132">This is Justice talking, not you.</string>
  <string id="6111133">You're losing control.</string>
  <string id="6111134">We are the same. It is my passion for this cause that drives him.</string>
  <string id="6111137">I will not give up this fight, Hawke. Know this now.</string>
  <string id="6111143">We have toed the line for a thousand years. We have given up our families, any chance for children, any chance for love.</string>
  <string id="6111146">And yet they fear us all the more. We can win no ground with appeasement.</string>
  <string id="6111149">One day everyone in Kirkwall will have to choose a side.</string>
  <string id="6111164">Why have you come? Is it time for another lecture about how reckless I'm being?</string>
  <string id="6111165">Why have you come here? Did the Keeper put you up to this?</string>
  <string id="6111166">How much is left if you strip both those out?</string>
  <string id="6111169">I'm sorry. I can't be anyone but who I am.</string>
  <string id="6111170">If that's the man you're looking for, you're in the wrong place.</string>
  <string id="6111173">Nothing would hurt as much as losing you.</string>
  <string id="6111174">I can't let you go.</string>
  <string id="6111175">You don't want to do this. I have no control around you.</string>
  <string id="6111178">You keep saying that. You haven't yet.</string>
  <string id="6111179">Promises, promises.</string>
  <string id="6111183">You could have a normal life. You don't want to be with an apostate.</string>
  <string id="6111186">I never thought I'd meet another mage like you. Another apostate.</string>
  <string id="6111189">Don't tempt me. Not unless you're ready for what that means.</string>
  <string id="6111190">You're getting in too deep here and I can't follow.</string>
  <string id="6111191">You're right.</string>
  <string id="6111192">It's better this way.</string>
  <string id="6111195">One day, the world must see us as people, not just mages. Help me make that happen.</string>
  <string id="6111196">Jethann, an elf in the Blooming Rose, might know more about Ninette. The Hightown brothel is open at night.</string>
  <string id="6111203">Good, I suppose? </string>
  <string id="6111206">Doesn't matter. Free for an evening?</string>
  <string id="6111209">I have no immediate patrols. Why?</string>
  <string id="6111210">Never mind. Free drinks at the Hanged Man. Be there.</string>
  <string id="6111211">Just be at the tavern later.</string>
  <string id="6111212">All right... the Hanged Man it is.</string>
  <string id="6111213">It's nothing to be concerned about. Meet me at the Hanged Man.</string>
  <string id="6111214">Let's have a friendly drink.</string>
  <string id="6111215">A night at the Hanged Man for all the guard. You'll come? Of course, you'll come.</string>
  <string id="6111216">Everyone's going out!</string>
  <string id="6111217">Do you need me to remind you that the mirror is dangerous?</string>
  <string id="6111218">Maybe.</string>
  <string id="6111219">It's not what you want to hear, Merrill, but you know what you're doing is dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6111220">You are being reckless.</string>
  <string id="6111221">I thought I still had a day to get my notes together. I guess I'll have to improvise.</string>
  <string id="6111222">Is it that time again?</string>
  <string id="6111223">No one put me up to anything.</string>
  <string id="6111224">The Keeper isn't involved.</string>
  <string id="6111225">I know you're angry with me, but I'm doing this for your sake.</string>
  <string id="6111226">I'm here for you.</string>
  <string id="6111227">I get a sovereign every time I tell you to think about your actions. Ten coppers per finger waggle, too.</string>
  <string id="6111228">She pays by the lecture.</string>
  <string id="6111231">Trash. Trash. Keep. Trash. Trash...</string>
  <string id="6111234">Won't be needing that anymore...</string>
  <string id="6111235">You're upset. We need to talk about it.</string>
  <string id="6111236">Anders, calm down.</string>
  <string id="6111237">Throwing everything out isn't going to make you feel better.</string>
  <string id="6111238">Anders, calm down.</string>
  <string id="6111251">Upset doesn't begin to cover it.</string>
  <string id="6111254">Should I feel better?</string>
  <string id="6111257">You were the only thing that kept me from murdering an innocent girl!</string>
  <string id="6111260">I murdered a girl! A mage! The very person I've dedicated my life to saving!</string>
  <string id="6111263">You were right. Justice and I... it's unnatural. It's twisted us both into something... monstrous.</string>
  <string id="6111264">It's all gone wrong. Justice and I. We're just a monster, same as any abomination.</string>
  <string id="6111265">I thought you'd be happy. I get it now, what you've been telling me.</string>
  <string id="6111268">I am a monster. Everything I ever do will be stained by this.</string>
  <string id="6111271">Should I have heard of this? Very well, Serah Hawke, I guess I'll be there.</string>
  <string id="6111272">Ah, you must be Hawke. Thank you for coming on such short notice.</string>
  <string id="6111274">How many times do I have to tell you it's not a threat? If you don't believe me, I'm wasting breath.</string>
  <string id="6111275">Only to myself! No one else is at risk!</string>
  <string id="6111276">I can't believe you're joking about this!</string>
  <string id="6111277">So you do this because you love to vex me, then?</string>
  <string id="6111278">Stop treating me like a child!</string>
  <string id="6111279">Well, at least now I understand why you go to such lengths to torment me.</string>
  <string id="6111280">If you weren't there, I'd have killed that girl.</string>
  <string id="6111283">I killed a girl. A mage! The very person I've been trying to protect.</string>
  <string id="6111286">I will not put myself in that position again.</string>
  <string id="6111287">You were out of control.</string>
  <string id="6111288">It wasn't your fault.</string>
  <string id="6111289">You didn't know who the girl was. It was an accident.</string>
  <string id="6111292">Exactly. One that happened because I am dangerous... unstable... everything the templars say.</string>
  <string id="6111295">But even then, you heard what I was saying. You knew, in your heart, that you had to stop.</string>
  <string id="6111298">You have too much faith in me. Without you, I'd never have known who was there until it was too late.</string>
  <string id="6111304">So you're just going to stop? Let the templars win?</string>
  <string id="6111305">You're giving up?</string>
  <string id="6111315">How can I fight for the freedom of mages, when I am the example of the worst that freedom brings?</string>
  <string id="6111316">Mages are dangerous. That's why this has been so hard.</string>
  <string id="6111317">Make yourself a good example.</string>
  <string id="6111318">Make yourself the proof that they can control their powers.</string>
  <string id="6111319">You are kind of everything good little apprentices are told to fear.</string>
  <string id="6111320">That's a good point.</string>
  <string id="6111321">The Circle is right. Mages are dangerous. You've proven that.</string>
  <string id="6111322">Give up this fight.</string>
  <string id="6111323">You're possessed. I doubt strong resolve will be enough to counter that.</string>
  <string id="6111324">How can you stop it?</string>
  <string id="6111331">How can I even trust myself to heal anymore? What if that... creature of vengeance turns on a patient?</string>
  <string id="6111334">Will he... will I... resist? Or will I loose his fury?</string>
  <string id="6111340">I don't know how.</string>
  <string id="6111343">Maybe you're right.</string>
  <string id="6111346">Maybe the Chantry can mediate this.</string>
  <string id="6111347">Find a peaceful way.</string>
  <string id="6111348">We got rid of Ser Alrik, right? Meredith will look downright reasonable in comparison.</string>
  <string id="6111349">I'll help you through this.</string>
  <string id="6111353">You can really go on, can't you? It's done, let's move on.</string>
  <string id="6111354">All right, I get it already.</string>
  <string id="6111355">This is my life. It is the whole of me. If these causes do not interest you, perhaps it is time for our paths to diverge.</string>
  <string id="6111358">I cannot pull back from what I am. Would you have me leave?</string>
  <string id="6111359">Stay, Anders. We can work this out together.</string>
  <string id="6111360">Stay with me.</string>
  <string id="6111364">Don't give up just because of complications. I thought you were more dedicated than that.</string>
  <string id="6111365">Stay with me.</string>
  <string id="6111366">Why is it you can say nothing without making me want to wring your neck?</string>
  <string id="6111369">Fine, yes! I cannot give up on this cause so easily.</string>
  <string id="6111378">Thank you. I will think on what you've said.</string>
  <string id="6111381">I want nothing more to do with you.</string>
  <string id="6111382">Leave now.</string>
  <string id="6111383">Understood.</string>
  <string id="6111386">Get yourself out of this. I've got nothing more I can say.</string>
  <string id="6111387">You're on your own.</string>
  <string id="6111391">I hope we both live to see the Circle fall.</string>
  <string id="6111395">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="6111396">Get to the point.</string>
  <string id="6111398">I retrieved a sack of human remains for you. Didn't you show it to the guard?</string>
  <string id="6111399">Did you show anyone the bones?</string>
  <string id="6111400">I did. They said the remains could've been gathered together by scavengers looking for bits of gold and jewelry.</string>
  <string id="6111407">Come to my house a moment, Hawke. There's something I should probably show you.</string>
  <string id="6111408">Do you think we could stop by my house in the alienage? There's something I ought to show you.</string>
  <string id="6111411">I'm leaving. Don't expect to see me here again.</string>
  <string id="6111412">I'm going to attend the girl's funeral. Perhaps her parents will believe she died at the templars' hands.</string>
  <string id="6111413">I can't go on like this.</string>
  <string id="6111414">Fenarel</string>
  <string id="6111416">Master Ilen</string>
  <string id="6111418">Junar</string>
  <string id="6111420">Maren</string>
  <string id="6111423">Hahren Paivel</string>
  <string id="6111431">Pol</string>
  <string id="6111436">Two of Yevhen's three sons were rescued.</string>
  <string id="6111437">Chandan</string>
  <string id="6111439">Harshal</string>
  <string id="6111441">Radha</string>
  <string id="6111443">Ineria</string>
  <string id="6111447">I've spent the past few years continuing my investigation into the murders of Ninette, Mharen, and the other women.</string>
  <string id="6111463">They said there was no way to tell if the remains even belonged to the missing women.</string>
  <string id="6111468">What have you learned about Gascard DuPuis?</string>
  <string id="6111469">Tell me about your suspicions.</string>
  <string id="6111470">He's a reclusive nobleman who's rarely seen outside his estate in Hightown.</string>
  <string id="6111480">And I'm supposed to be the outside help.</string>
  <string id="6111481">And so you've come to me.</string>
  <string id="6111482">What do you need me to do?</string>
  <string id="6111483">I will help if I can.</string>
  <string id="6111484">No one else believes you. Why should I?</string>
  <string id="6111485">Why should I get involved?</string>
  <string id="6111536">Please, my mother. Don't let her lose another baby!</string>
  <string id="6111537">I haven't eaten all day.</string>
  <string id="6111538">I can't get my brother off the boat. The grippe's got him bad.</string>
  <string id="6111539">Is there any flour? We've been out for a week. The children are eating sawdust.</string>
  <string id="6111540">I asked at thirty farms for work. Not one is hiring Fereldans.</string>
  <string id="6111541">I should have stayed home and took my chances with the Blight.</string>
  <string id="6111542">I got five kids to feed! Where do I find work?</string>
  <string id="6111543">My wife died yesterday. I'm taking up a collection to afford the burning.</string>
  <string id="6111549">If you're wise, you'll stay far away from Merrill. No sane person would touch what she's taken up.</string>
  <string id="6111552">We have our bows trained on you, shemlen. Conduct your business with the Keeper quickly.</string>
  <string id="6111553">Sealed Door</string>
  <string id="6111558">I don't think the guards raiding the estate met that particular reception.</string>
  <string id="6111559">I think Gascard's expecting us.</string>
  <string id="6111560">Looks like we're in the right place.</string>
  <string id="6111561">Why couldn't he have had guard dogs instead?</string>
  <string id="6111562">There's dark magic here. Gascard must be the man we're looking for.</string>
  <string id="6111563">Looks like Emeric's right. Gascard is trying to hide something.</string>
  <string id="6111573">We owe you a debt for taking Merrill from here. Be welcome among us, human.</string>
  <string id="6111580">I think these have been used in blood magic.</string>
  <string id="6111581">Hmm. Blood magic. Someone's been naughty.</string>
  <string id="6111585">Screams Help me! Please! He's gone mad!</string>
  <string id="6111586">Golem Control Rod</string>
  <string id="6111590">It's not often we allow humans into our camp. Take care not to abuse the privilege.</string>
  <string id="6111592">I'm as Fereldan as you. I won't harm your healer.</string>
  <string id="6111593">We're on the same side.</string>
  <string id="6111594">Fereldan? But... you, your clothes... I figured you for a Kirkwaller. Sorry. </string>
  <string id="6111597">Maker bless the rule of our King Alistair.</string>
  <string id="6111598">Maker bless the rule of our Queen Anora.</string>
  <string id="6111601">I'm not turning your healer over to the templars.</string>
  <string id="6111602">I won't hurt him.</string>
  <string id="6111603">Right. Like anyone turns down the reward for an apostate.</string>
  <string id="6111606">Let's shut their mouths.</string>
  <string id="6111607">Shut her mouth, boys.</string>
  <string id="6111608">Shut his mouth, lads.</string>
  <string id="6111609">Does this really seem like a good idea?</string>
  <string id="6111610">Are you threatening me?</string>
  <string id="6111611">Don't question me!</string>
  <string id="6111612">Back off!</string>
  <string id="6111613">Let's show these folks a little Fereldan justice!</string>
  <string id="6111614">Let's show this bitch a little Fereldan justice!</string>
  <string id="6111615">Let's show this bloke a little Fereldan justice!</string>
  <string id="6111618">You're not... you're not him!</string>
  <string id="6111627">Ninette's Ring</string>
  <string id="6111631">Sack of Bones</string>
  <string id="6111640">Great. Better not be a thanks for your service last drink.</string>
  <string id="6111652">Door</string>
  <string id="6111654">Very well, Serah Hawke. I... guess I'll see you there?</string>
  <string id="6111656">Wait!</string>
  <string id="6111659">Are these accusations true?</string>
  <string id="6111660">The Circle, a prison?</string>
  <string id="6111661">Ask any mage in Kirkwall. Over a dozen were made Tranquil just this year.</string>
  <string id="6111664">The more people you ask, the worse the rumors become.</string>
  <string id="6111665">Forcing mages into servitude is not the way to prevent the rise of another Imperium.</string>
  <string id="6111666">Mages need their freedom.</string>
  <string id="6111667">That's not usually the response I get. Perhaps we will work together better than I expected.</string>
  <string id="6111668">I doubt the Divine would agree with that.</string>
  <string id="6111669">That's a little controversial.</string>
  <string id="6111670">The Divine is only a mouthpiece for the Chantry. The Maker does not speak through her.</string>
  <string id="6111673">Mages fall to demons! The Chantry can't trust them with the same freedoms as normal men.</string>
  <string id="6111674">Mages must be contained.</string>
  <string id="6111675">You are a mage yourself. I feel the power in you. How can you say that?</string>
  <string id="6111678">Never mind. I do not seek debate, only your aid. </string>
  <string id="6111679">And who are you to decide that how the Maker created me isn't normal.</string>
  <string id="6111682">Now, will you aid me or no?</string>
  <string id="6111685">You will never take another mage as you took him!</string>
  <string id="6111688">My maps are yours. As am I, if you wish me to join your expedition.</string>
  <string id="6111711">Maker, why did I say that?</string>
  <string id="6111715">Did she just...? No.</string>
  <string id="6111719">Did he just...? No.</string>
  <string id="6111727">You've... ruined everything.</string>
  <string id="6111749">Emeric was certain you were the killer.</string>
  <string id="6111750">Emeric suspected you.</string>
  <string id="6111751">Of course he was. But I was trying to find the killer, just like him.</string>
  <string id="6111754">Our paths crossed, and he just assumed I was the murderer.</string>
  <string id="6111755">I could report you to the templars for blood magic.</string>
  <string id="6111756">You're a blood mage.</string>
  <string id="6111757">Yes, I've used blood magic and lyrium to augment my powers.</string>
  <string id="6111764">Who killed your sister?</string>
  <string id="6111765">Tell me about the killer.</string>
  <string id="6111802">No, I've worked too hard! It can't end like this!</string>
  <string id="6111808">Never good to be the last to hear of these things.</string>
  <string id="6111855">The guard captain... Aveline... is a treasure. You have my thanks, serah.</string>
  <string id="6111929">You have a task to perform. You shouldn't linger here.</string>
  <string id="6111933">For someone who insists that she has chosen to leave, you certainly can't seem to stay away, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6111937">Don't get your smallclothes in a twist, Hahren. I'm leaving again soon enough.</string>
  <string id="6111949">Nobody's lingering. We'll be away promptly, Hahren.</string>
  <string id="6111969">If you walk the paths of Sundermount, walk softly. Something out there hungers for the unwary.</string>
  <string id="6111983">Serah Hawke. It's been some time. You're here in Hightown now, right? I think the captain mentioned it.</string>
  <string id="6111986">I see your uncle now and then on my patrols but... we don't talk.</string>
  <string id="6111987">No ill effects from the ambush, I trust?</string>
  <string id="6111988">Have you fully recovered?</string>
  <string id="6111989">Guard is a good career if you're careful. A short one if you're not.</string>
  <string id="6111992">They got me pretty good, I'll admit, but they fared worse, so I can't complain.</string>
  <string id="6111993">I'm just making a delivery. This is for you.</string>
  <string id="6111994">Here, take this.</string>
  <string id="6111995">This is for you. It's apparently very important.</string>
  <string id="6111996">I have something you may need.</string>
  <string id="6111997">I have it on good authority that you are going to enjoy this.</string>
  <string id="6111998">A secret gift.</string>
  <string id="6112007">Last bottle of the Agreggio. I've been saving it for a special occasion.</string>
  <string id="6112010">And what's that?</string>
  <string id="6112013">The anniversary of my escape.</string>
  <string id="6112016">Astia valla femundis.</string>
  <string id="6112019">Care to hear the story?</string>
  <string id="6112020">I thought you avoided talking about this.</string>
  <string id="6112021">You want to discuss it now?</string>
  <string id="6112022">Not on special occasions.</string>
  <string id="6112023">Then go ahead.</string>
  <string id="6112024">Not interested.</string>
  <string id="6112026">Why not?</string>
  <string id="6112027">Go ahead. Get it out of your system.</string>
  <string id="6112033">I'd like that.</string>
  <string id="6112042">Another time, maybe.</string>
  <string id="6112043">Not really.</string>
  <string id="6112044">Fair enough.</string>
  <string id="6112045">I enjoy listening to you talk.</string>
  <string id="6112046">Tell me anything you like.</string>
  <string id="6112047">And I enjoy a man willing to speak his mind.</string>
  <string id="6112050">There are few pleasures greater than speaking with a beautiful woman.</string>
  <string id="6112053">Let's see. You've heard of Seheron? The Imperium and the Qunari have fought over the island for centuries, now.</string>
  <string id="6112056">I was there with Danarius during a Qunari attack. I managed to get him to a ship—but there was no room for a slave.</string>
  <string id="6112059">I was left behind. I barely got out of the city alive.</string>
  <string id="6112060">You escaped only by chance.</string>
  <string id="6112061">So it wasn't your choice.</string>
  <string id="6112062">That time, yes.</string>
  <string id="6112065">I thought Danarius considered you valuable?</string>
  <string id="6112066">He abandoned you?</string>
  <string id="6112067">Laughs He wasn't given a choice. The look on his face as the ship pulled out was priceless.</string>
  <string id="6112070">There's nothing like war for covering one's escape.</string>
  <string id="6112071">Sounds like fun.</string>
  <string id="6112072">I had no intention of escaping. That time.</string>
  <string id="6112075">There are rebels in the Seheron jungles called Fog Warriors. They found me and took me in, nursed me back to health.</string>
  <string id="6112078">I stayed with them for a time. Until Danarius finally came for me.</string>
  <string id="6112079">Whether you wanted to go or not, I assume.</string>
  <string id="6112080">And you refused to go.</string>
  <string id="6112081">Were you with these Fog Warriors willingly?</string>
  <string id="6112082">Didn't you want to leave?</string>
  <string id="6112083">He was relieved to see you'd survived, right?</string>
  <string id="6112084">I can see where this is going.</string>
  <string id="6112085">Relieved to see his investment hadn't ended up in Qunari hands, perhaps.</string>
  <string id="6112088">I'd grown fond of the rebels. They bowed to no master and fought for their freedom. It was... beyond my experience.</string>
  <string id="6112091">When Danarius came, they refused to let him take me.</string>
  <string id="6112097">He ordered me to kill them. So I did. I killed them all.</string>
  <string id="6112098">You gave up.</string>
  <string id="6112099">So much for freedom.</string>
  <string id="6112100">Why would you do such a thing?</string>
  <string id="6112101">What? Why?</string>
  <string id="6112102">Once a slave always a slave?</string>
  <string id="6112103">Old habits die hard?</string>
  <string id="6112104">It felt inevitable. My master had returned and this, this fantasy life was over.</string>
  <string id="6112107">But once it was done, I looked down at their bodies. I felt... I couldn't...</string>
  <string id="6112110">I ran. And never looked back.</string>
  <string id="6112111">Didn't Danarius stop you?</string>
  <string id="6112112">How did you get away?</string>
  <string id="6112113">Couldn't you have found other Fog Warriors? Become a rebel?</string>
  <string id="6112114">You didn't stay in Seheron?</string>
  <string id="6112115">I have to wonder why you stayed with Danarius as long as you did.</string>
  <string id="6112116">Why didn't you leave earlier?</string>
  <string id="6112117">I don't see why you didn't kill him right there.</string>
  <string id="6112118">Danarius should be dead.</string>
  <string id="6112119">This can't be easy to talk about.</string>
  <string id="6112120">Thank you for telling me.</string>
  <string id="6112121">Gripping stuff. You should write it down.</string>
  <string id="6112122">It's a good story.</string>
  <string id="6112125">And the captain makes sure we're careful.</string>
  <string id="6112126">All right.</string>
  <string id="6112129">It's a copper relief of... marigolds? And it helpfully says so. Marigolds.</string>
  <string id="6112132">Well. How crafty. Is there a meaning to this that I should know?</string>
  <string id="6112133">Tell me this wasn't a waste of my time.</string>
  <string id="6112134">You mean there isn't?</string>
  <string id="6112135">I... can't do that.</string>
  <string id="6112138">Right. I'm sure we both have things to do. Of varying import. Serah Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6112139">Just keep it. I'm sure it's more than it seems.</string>
  <string id="6112140">There must be.</string>
  <string id="6112141">It would have to be.</string>
  <string id="6112142">Possibly Here, you throw this away?</string>
  <string id="6112143">It's apparently garbage.</string>
  <string id="6112144">Well, it certainly conveys that.</string>
  <string id="6112145">Am I now?</string>
  <string id="6112154">Guardsman Donnic?</string>
  <string id="6112157">Yes. Serah Hawke, right? Out of Lowtown until recently.</string>
  <string id="6112160">You're a friend of the captain. What can I do for you?</string>
  <string id="6112166">I am not seeing the sense to this.</string>
  <string id="6112167">Is there some reason Aveline just made us look like idiots?</string>
  <string id="6112168">Why did Aveline want us to give him that?</string>
  <string id="6112169">This story bends like a biscuit. What was that about?</string>
  <string id="6112170">Aveline better have good reason for this.</string>
  <string id="6112175">I'll take you at your word.</string>
  <string id="6112178">Thanks for this, uh... thing.</string>
  <string id="6112193">Dead Messenger</string>
  <string id="6112197">Dead Messenger</string>
  <string id="6112198">This dead man is clutching a messenger's pouch, which has the seal of the Grey Wardens.</string>
  <string id="6112199">Dark Epiphany</string>
  <string id="6112200">During the day, deliver the Grey Warden letters to a dead drop near the foundries in Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6112202">The Warden letters were returned. Check back at Gamlen's house for word.</string>
  <string id="6112215">Grey Warden Documents</string>
  <string id="6112217">I used to wish I had just been taken by the Circle. Like our cousins. I could have been the Hero of Ferelden.</string>
  <string id="6112220">Maybe then Mother would have stopped second-guessing herself.</string>
  <string id="6112223">Mother watched her cousin lose so many children to the Circle. It was her worst fear.</string>
  <string id="6112226">And then one of them became the Hero of Ferelden and saved us all. </string>
  <string id="6112229">The Maker works in mysterious ways, right?</string>
  <string id="6112230">We're home now.</string>
  <string id="6112236">Bethany</string>
  <string id="6112281">Anso said he will remain in the Lowtown Bazaar for a while longer.</string>
  <string id="6112285">Elves seem drawn here as much as they're pushed. At some point, are they not caging themselves?</string>
  <string id="6112295">We need to talk. In the barracks, please.</string>
  <string id="6112296">We need to talk. At my office in the barracks.</string>
  <string id="6112299">Not out here, Hawke. Let's take this back to the barracks.</string>
  <string id="6112339">When you have a moment, maybe we could talk?</string>
  <string id="6112345">One ingredient was found. There are three left to locate.</string>
  <string id="6112346">Two ingredients were found. There are two left to locate.</string>
  <string id="6112347">Three ingredients were found. There is only one left to locate.</string>
  <string id="6112348">All ingredients were found. Take them to Clara.</string>
  <string id="6112351">Let's just go, already.</string>
  <string id="6112512">Carver</string>
  <string id="6112514">Alchemically Sealed Flask</string>
  <string id="6112518">Purified Deathroot</string>
  <string id="6112522">Twice-Distilled Quicksilver</string>
  <string id="6112526">Ebon Rathleek</string>
  <string id="6112544">Some mage sent that thing here to kill him. Why would anyone...</string>
  <string id="6112550">He suspected a man named Gascard DuPuis. Did he do this?</string>
  <string id="6112551">I killed Gascard.</string>
  <string id="6112552">He's dead.</string>
  <string id="6112553">I can't be certain of anything. Gascard may have tricked me.</string>
  <string id="6112554">It's not that simple.</string>
  <string id="6112555">Gascard played me, and now he's escaped to Darktown.</string>
  <string id="6112556">Yes. He fooled me.</string>
  <string id="6112564">Aren't you Hawke? Emeric left not long ago. He said you'd arranged to meet tonight.</string>
  <string id="6112565">Perhaps you're mistaken.</string>
  <string id="6112566">Are you sure?</string>
  <string id="6112567">Did I tell him that? I must have completely forgotten.</string>
  <string id="6112568">Really?</string>
  <string id="6112569">There was no such arrangement.</string>
  <string id="6112570">Nonsense.</string>
  <string id="6112571">I am not mistaken. You sent him a message a half hour ago. Look.</string>
  <string id="6112574">I didn't send this.</string>
  <string id="6112577">You didn't? Strange.</string>
  <string id="6112612">Only your uncle would own something called a wallop mallet.</string>
  <string id="6112614">Wallop mallet? What a name that is!</string>
  <string id="6112615">Isn't there a mallet hanging on the wall in Gamlen's house?</string>
  <string id="6112618">What's a wallop mallet? Maybe we should ask your uncle.</string>
  <string id="6112620">Ingredient Chest</string>
  <string id="6112634">Darktown's a big place, but we'll find him. He's an apostate, and Meredith will want him hunted down.</string>
  <string id="6112656">Maybe I should go back and talk to Gamlen about this.</string>
  <string id="6112662">Any new disappearing acts?</string>
  <string id="6112663">Why have you sent for me?</string>
  <string id="6112664">I came as soon as I could.</string>
  <string id="6112673">Perhaps we should pay a visit to Gamlen's would-be captor.</string>
  <string id="6112674">I'd like to pay a visit to whoever is setting up these fun little games.</string>
  <string id="6112675">So they still insist on playing games...</string>
  <string id="6112676">It's time to end this charade.</string>
  <string id="6112683">Looks like we found the crates.</string>
  <string id="6112684">Aha! The crates we were looking for!</string>
  <string id="6112685">I wonder what's in these crates.</string>
  <string id="6112686">Well, here are the crates we were looking for.</string>
  <string id="6112696">Only one way to find out what's inside.</string>
  <string id="6112703">I believe this market rivals Denerim, but I haven't visited in a very long time.</string>
  <string id="6112704">The heart of the city. For both commerce and crime, judging from my reports.</string>
  <string id="6112705">My term as captain has not been popular here. But you get used to it.</string>
  <string id="6112710">A place where we should be coming together. For most, it's barely a nod as they pass. </string>
  <string id="6112713">It is.. unfortunate this place is necessary.</string>
  <string id="6112716">Money enough comes through here. Why we have such trouble with smugglers I don't know.</string>
  <string id="6112719">I feel like there's a different law at work in this place. Someone else's rules.</string>
  <string id="6112730">Outside the city, outside the rules. That's what they like to think.</string>
  <string id="6112733">The guards don't get here often enough.</string>
  <string id="6112736">Watch yourself. Having a member of the guard along carries little weight here.</string>
  <string id="6112737">Watch yourself. Captain of the guard carries little weight here.</string>
  <string id="6112751">There's extra for each scroll we deliver intact!</string>
  <string id="6112752">If those letters make it to the Wardens, it'll be your hides!</string>
  <string id="6112753">Orders are clear. No witnesses.</string>
  <string id="6112788">It's a trap!</string>
  <string id="6112870">No! Please, messere...</string>
  <string id="6112882">No... Oh, Maker, please... Forgive me.</string>
  <string id="6112888">They will die! I will have every last templar for these abuses!</string>
  <string id="6112889">It's over, Anders. They're all dead.</string>
  <string id="6112890">Calm down.</string>
  <string id="6112891">The templars are gone. You can stop glowing.</string>
  <string id="6112892">What's wrong with you?</string>
  <string id="6112893">We'll kill them all. I promise.</string>
  <string id="6112894">They will die.</string>
  <string id="6112895">Every one of them will feel justice's burn.</string>
  <string id="6112898">I am no demon! Are you one of them, that you would call me such!</string>
  <string id="6112901">No! Andraste, please, take it away. I've been good. I've served the Chantry—</string>
  <string id="6112904">Silence!</string>
  <string id="6112905">Anders, that girl is a mage. We rescued her from being made Tranquil.</string>
  <string id="6112906">Don't hurt her!</string>
  <string id="6112907">She is theirs! I can feel their hold on her!</string>
  <string id="6112910">She's the reason you're fighting, Anders. Don't turn on her now.</string>
  <string id="6112916">You are here under my command! Not another step!</string>
  <string id="6112917">Back down, Anders!</string>
  <string id="6112918">Justice... answers to nobody!</string>
  <string id="6112921">This is not the way to do it. Save your fire for the templars!</string>
  <string id="6112924">Please, messere...</string>
  <string id="6112930">Maker, no. I almost... If you weren't here...</string>
  <string id="6112960">You're out of control, Anders!</string>
  <string id="6112961">Get a hold of yourself!</string>
  <string id="6112962">I thought you told me you were a good spirit?</string>
  <string id="6112963">This is Justice?</string>
  <string id="6112964">Get over yourself and let's finish this.</string>
  <string id="6112965">Are you done?</string>
  <string id="6112966">I will have my vengeance!</string>
  <string id="6112972">Lyrium smugglers built these tunnels. To service the templars who crave the stuff.</string>
  <string id="6112973">I have personally led five mages to freedom through these tunnels. They bent to kiss the ground through the sewage.</string>
  <string id="6112974">It tells you something of Kirkwall's attitude, that they house their mages in an old slave prison.</string>
  <string id="6112975">The templars are despicable. They fear to fight us, so they destroy our minds instead.</string>
  <string id="6112976">It would be better as open warfare. At least then mages might get a fair fight.</string>
  <string id="6112977">If we find evidence of Ser Alrik's plan, I'm taking it straight to the grand cleric.</string>
  <string id="6112980">She will not be able to claim neutrality then.</string>
  <string id="6112984">This is it. This tunnel will take us into the Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6112987">Are you ready to help me find evidence of the Tranquil Solution?</string>
  <string id="6112988">Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6112989">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6112990">Just tap the stone here...</string>
  <string id="6112993">I'll be back when I'm ready.</string>
  <string id="6112994">Not yet.</string>
  <string id="6112995">We should go before Ser Alrik puts it into action.</string>
  <string id="6112996">I'll be waiting.</string>
  <string id="6113002">Have you noticed how many Tranquil are in the Gallows courtyard lately?</string>
  <string id="6113005">And don't tell me I'm just sensitive to it. I've been watching and every day there are new Tranquil, selling their bloody wares.</string>
  <string id="6113008">Good mages, too. People I know passed their Harrowing.</string>
  <string id="6113009">Doesn't Chantry law say that mages who pass their Harrowing can't be made Tranquil?</string>
  <string id="6113010">That's against the law.</string>
  <string id="6113011">Exactly.</string>
  <string id="6113014">Are you imagining some sinister plot to turn all the mages in Kirkwall Tranquil?</string>
  <string id="6113015">You think there's a plan?</string>
  <string id="6113016">I'm not imagining it.</string>
  <string id="6113019">What's it to you how many Tranquil there are?</string>
  <string id="6113020">So what?</string>
  <string id="6113021">The templars are using the Rite of Tranquility to silence those who speak against them.</string>
  <string id="6113024">They're working on a deliberate plan to turn every mage in Kirkwall within the next three years.</string>
  <string id="6113025">Whatever you think of templars, you can't imagine they're so heartless—</string>
  <string id="6113026">They wouldn't do that.</string>
  <string id="6113027">They're worse.</string>
  <string id="6113030">And here I was worried you were having delusions of persecution again.</string>
  <string id="6113031">You're crazy.</string>
  <string id="6113032">There are groups in Kirkwall who help those fleeing the Circle. I've talked to people on the inside.</string>
  <string id="6113035">Who's behind this?</string>
  <string id="6113036">We must stop them.</string>
  <string id="6113037">The plan is the work of a templar named Ser Alrik.</string>
  <string id="6113040">I've had a run-in with him myself. He's the one who did the ritual on Karl. Nasty piece of work, likes to make mages beg.</string>
  <string id="6113041">What happened between you and Ser Alrik?</string>
  <string id="6113042">A run-in?</string>
  <string id="6113043">I've been involved with an... underground resistance. Mages, living free in Kirkwall, who help others escape.</string>
  <string id="6113046">I can't tell you any more, for your sake and theirs. You have too much involvement with the Guard and nobility.</string>
  <string id="6113049">Suffice it to say, I've been in the Gallows. I've seen his work firsthand.</string>
  <string id="6113050">What else do you know about Ser Alrik?</string>
  <string id="6113051">Tell me about this templar.</string>
  <string id="6113052">The knight-commander is at least sincere in her convictions. However misguided, she believes she's helping people.</string>
  <string id="6113055">Ser Alrik's a sadist. Cold-blooded as a lizard.</string>
  <string id="6113058">He likes to experiment on mages, find out what it takes to push them into the arms of demons.</string>
  <string id="6113059">Then perhaps the blame can be laid on him, and not every templar?</string>
  <string id="6113060">Not all templars are that bad.</string>
  <string id="6113061">That's what I hope. If we bring the evidence of this plan to light, there must be men who'll stand against it.</string>
  <string id="6113064">Perhaps even the grand cleric will finally be forced to act.</string>
  <string id="6113067">Don't templars have anything better to do than come up with new ways to torment mages?</string>
  <string id="6113068">What are they, bored?</string>
  <string id="6113069">No.</string>
  <string id="6113072">How do we stop them?</string>
  <string id="6113073">Do you have a plan?</string>
  <string id="6113074">I've been working with a group, a secret mage underground that helps others escape the Gallows. They have a way in.</string>
  <string id="6113077">My friends in the mage underground know a way inside.</string>
  <string id="6113080">A secret entrance under the walls of the Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6113083">Come with me, tonight, please. Help me find the evidence of Ser Alrik's Tranquil Solution.</string>
  <string id="6113084">What do you mean, Tranquil Solution?</string>
  <string id="6113085">Tranquil solution?</string>
  <string id="6113086">That's what he calls it. His idea of a peaceful solution to the mage problem—to sunder the mind of every mage in the Free Marches!</string>
  <string id="6113089">I'm told he's bringing his proposal to Val Royeaux, to the Divine herself.</string>
  <string id="6113092">He would turn every mage in Thedas into a drooling simpleton under his command!</string>
  <string id="6113093">If this plot exists, it must be exposed.</string>
  <string id="6113094">Of course, I'll help.</string>
  <string id="6113095">I'll be there. Though this Ser Alrik would be a fool to keep such a plan in writing.</string>
  <string id="6113096">Of course, I'll help.</string>
  <string id="6113097">Then let us pray he's a fool as well as a bastard.</string>
  <string id="6113100">Let us go before they can act.</string>
  <string id="6113101">Of course, I'll help.</string>
  <string id="6113102">Thank you. I confess, I wasn't sure you'd share my outrage. I'm glad I can count on this much.</string>
  <string id="6113105">I am honored by your trust.</string>
  <string id="6113108">I wouldn't let you face this alone.</string>
  <string id="6113109">Of course, I'll help.</string>
  <string id="6113110">You are the one bright light in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6113113">I've always feared being made Tranquil. Now more than ever.</string>
  <string id="6113116">I couldn't live to see you Tranquil at that monster's hand.</string>
  <string id="6113119">I'd rather die than have that monster strip away my feelings for you.</string>
  <string id="6113122">I'm ready to go when you are. Our entrance is concealed not far from here.</string>
  <string id="6113126">I'm sorry. I cannot stir more trouble between the mages and templars of Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6113127">You're on your own.</string>
  <string id="6113128">I don't want to break into the Gallows unless I know I can get out again.</string>
  <string id="6113129">You're on your own.</string>
  <string id="6113130">I will take no part in this.</string>
  <string id="6113131">You're on your own.</string>
  <string id="6113132">You can't be neutral.</string>
  <string id="6113135">If you don't help, then you're standing by while the templars work themselves up to massacre us.</string>
  <string id="6113170">I believe I finally have a suspect, a man called Gascard DuPuis.</string>
  <string id="6113220">I've been looking into the murders of several women for the past few years.</string>
  <string id="6113223">I now believe these women were abducted and killed by the same man: Gascard DuPuis.</string>
  <string id="6113231">Is there something I can help you with, Emeric?</string>
  <string id="6113232">What do you need?</string>
  <string id="6113233">I jump at any chance to visit the Gallows. It's such an uplifting place.</string>
  <string id="6113234">It's no trouble.</string>
  <string id="6113238">There you are.</string>
  <string id="6113241">I don't let anyone who crossed me get this big in this town.</string>
  <string id="6113244">On him, lads.</string>
  <string id="6113250">Hawke, wasn't it?</string>
  <string id="6113253">Apparently your uncle was right. Been hearing a lot of good things. Guess I should have fought harder to recruit you.</string>
  <string id="6113262">Hawke, wasn't it?</string>
  <string id="6113265">It's really too bad we didn't get you. Seems your uncle was right after all.</string>
  <string id="6113274">Why hello there. Remember me?</string>
  <string id="6113277">You still owe me from what you gave to that urchin. Since you've done so well for yourself...</string>
  <string id="6113278">You're right. I probably could pay you back.</string>
  <string id="6113279">We can work this out.</string>
  <string id="6113280">I'm not paying you for goods you stole in the first place.</string>
  <string id="6113281">Forget it.</string>
  <string id="6113282">Too late.</string>
  <string id="6113285">Your uncle still owes us... but I figure why bleed a stone? You've done so well, after all.</string>
  <string id="6113286">If my uncle owes you, talk to him. Not me.</string>
  <string id="6113287">Gamlen's debts aren't mine.</string>
  <string id="6113288">Oh, but it's more than that.</string>
  <string id="6113291">If Gamlen owes you, I'm sure we can come to an arrangement.</string>
  <string id="6113292">We can work this out.</string>
  <string id="6113293">I think it's well past that.</string>
  <string id="6113296">I've done so well because I've carved my way through half of Kirkwall! You really want to cross me?</string>
  <string id="6113297">Are you joking?</string>
  <string id="6113298">You spurned my offer. And lost us some serious coin.</string>
  <string id="6113301">I intend to take what you owe—with interest.</string>
  <string id="6113345">And you're as direct as I've been told. Good.</string>
  <string id="6113348">As I mentioned in my message, I require your help.</string>

  <string id="6113493">We were wrong.</string>
  <string id="6113496">Maybe they deserve to win. Maybe they're right.</string>
  <string id="6113499">Ah, and here we get to the crux of the matter. I cannot lay a finger on DuPuis.</string>
  <string id="6113502">It's Orlesian. I believe he is descended from nobility.</string>
  <string id="6113505">No, I know where DuPuis is. I just can't get to him.</string>
  <string id="6113508">When I became convinced of his guilt, I went to the city guard and demanded that they do something.</string>
  <string id="6113511">The guards raided his mansion and found nothing. They were forced to apologize, and I was reprimanded.</string>
  <string id="6113514">Meredith forbade me from continuing my investigation. But she didn't say I couldn't seek outside help.</string>
  <string id="6113515">The will was found. Gamlen gambled away the riches that were left to him.</string>
  <string id="6113518">They're still here? But they should have left ages ago!</string>
  <string id="6113520">We're not giving you up.</string>
  <string id="6113521">Well, let them come.</string>
  <string id="6113524">Right. What do we have on hand?</string>
  <string id="6113527">Strip the camp, and we'll ready a fitting welcome.</string>
  <string id="6113530">Less talk, more preparation. What do we have on hand?</string>
  <string id="6113535">What is the Keeper thinking? What if the templars come? Or an angry mob! This is madness!</string>
  <string id="6113571">Were you the only person investigating these murders?</string>
  <string id="6113572">Who else is looking into this?</string>
  <string id="6113573">Yes, unfortunately. The templar order believes this is a matter for the city guard.</string>
  <string id="6113582">He knew two of the murdered women and made inquiries about the others.</string>
  <string id="6113585">It cannot be a coincidence.</string>
  <string id="6113588">I'm sorry, Emeric, but that's the truth of it.</string>
  <string id="6113589">I had no choice but to continue the investigation on my own.</string>
  <string id="6113596">Help Wanted</string>
  <string id="6113606">I have something for you.</string>
  <string id="6113607">You'll need to go to Gascard DuPuis's estate after nightfall. </string>
  <string id="6113610">Please figure out what DuPuis is hiding. If he's innocent, find evidence to prove me wrong.</string>
  <string id="6113619">You're back. Of course you are. You're efficient. Get things done. Good or ill.</string>
  <string id="6113631">Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6113632">I knew I could count on you.</string>
  <string id="6113635">My hands are tied. I can't do this on my own.</string>
  <string id="6113638">Because the killer will get away unless we do something about it.</string>
  <string id="6113642">Bringing you here wasn't exactly a favor.</string>
  <string id="6113645">I'm not sure this was a kindness.</string>
  <string id="6113648">I'm not sure thanks applies to this. Not without a lot of irony, anyway.</string>
  <string id="6113657">This was all incredibly stupid. And you made it wonderful.</string>
  <string id="6113658">You were dead set on messing this up. Don't forget that.</string>
  <string id="6113659">You put up a fight.</string>
  <string id="6113672">You were right. Donnic's not like the others.</string>
  <string id="6113673">Just be happy.</string>
  <string id="6113674">Hawke?</string>
  <string id="6113677">He's a lucky man. Don't look back.</string>
  <string id="6113737">It's just that simple.</string>
  <string id="6113747">That's not funny. I need your help, urgently.</string>
  <string id="6113750">And I thank you once again.</string>
  <string id="6113756">Laughs</string>
  <string id="6113784">He's lying! He hurt me!</string>
  <string id="6113787">I've explained this! I need your blood to track you down if he took you. It was for your protection!</string>
  <string id="6113790">Let go of me!</string>
  <string id="6113796">A powerful and experienced blood mage. I believe he uses the women for some ritual.</string>
  <string id="6113805">His victims are attractive, healthy women with few social ties.</string>
  <string id="6113808">I'm not proud of what I've done, but I had to. He took my sister from me.</string>
  <string id="6113813">As you wish.</string>
  <string id="6113819">Fenris?</string>
  <string id="6113822">I have been thinking of you. In fact, I have been able to think of little else.</string>
  <string id="6113828">Command me to go, and I shall.</string>
  <string id="6113830">Don't go.</string>
  <string id="6113831">Shut up.</string>
  <string id="6113834">No need.</string>
  <string id="6113837">Did I say anything?</string>
  <string id="6113845">I don't remember inviting you.</string>
  <string id="6113846">Leave.</string>
  <string id="6113847">As you wish.</string>
  <string id="6113848">You have the worst timing.</string>
  <string id="6113849">Now's not good.</string>
  <string id="6113850">Ah. That is nothing new, I fear.</string>
  <string id="6113853">I will leave you be.</string>
  <string id="6113858">The rebels had wounded him. The soldiers he brought attempted to capture me—unsuccessfully.</string>
  <string id="6113861">It was weeks before Danarius was able to mount the hunt in earnest, but by then, I was already gone.</string>
  <string id="6113862">Even if I did, I felt... unworthy.</string>
  <string id="6113865">I had no way of knowing if I could truly escape from Danarius then. I didn't even know what that meant. I simply had to get away.</string>
  <string id="6113868">I stowed aboard a ship to the mainland and moved south... chased by my former master every step of the way.</string>
  <string id="6113869">How well did you know these Fog Warriors?</string>
  <string id="6113870">You regretted killing them?</string>
  <string id="6113871">I knew them only a few months, but in that time, I felt as if I truly lived.</string>
  <string id="6113874">They were bold. Strong. Free with their affections.</string>
  <string id="6113877">I was in awe of them, and owed them everything. And I turned on them even so.</string>
  <string id="6113878">You have not been a slave.</string>
  <string id="6113881">A slave does not dream of freedom, or wonder at possibilities. You think only of your master's desires, and what the next hour will bring.</string>
  <string id="6113884">It did not occur to me that I could be anything else until I had a taste of it.</string>
  <string id="6113885">But there are stories of slaves rebelling all the time. They did in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6113886">All slaves feel that way?</string>
  <string id="6113887">The ritual that gave me my markings also stripped me of my memory.</string>
  <string id="6113890">Whatever I was before may as well have never been. Perhaps if I knew, I might have felt differently.</string>
  <string id="6113891">I wasn't running from him. Not at first.</string>
  <string id="6113894">You think they teach slaves how to write?</string>
  <string id="6113900">I have never spoken about what happened, to anyone. I've never wanted to.</string>
  <string id="6113903">Perhaps this is what it means to have a friend.</string>
  <string id="6113904">It might mean more than that.</string>
  <string id="6113905">Just friends?</string>
  <string id="6113906">Or maybe it means we just fight together.</string>
  <string id="6113907">Let's not go crazy.</string>
  <string id="6113908">Laughs You could be right.</string>
  <string id="6113911">Perhaps you're right.</string>
  <string id="6113912">I agree.</string>
  <string id="6113916">Might want to take it easy on that bottle.</string>
  <string id="6113917">Or too much wine.</string>
  <string id="6113918">It's the last one, I swear.</string>
  <string id="6113921">To you, Hawke. A finer mage I have never met.</string>
  <string id="6113922">To you, Hawke. May I fight at your side for years to come.</string>
  <string id="6113923">You and I don't always agree, but...</string>
  <string id="6113924">But...?</string>
  <string id="6113925">You were saying...?</string>
  <string id="6113926">I... have never allowed anyone too close.</string>
  <string id="6113929">When my markings were created, the pain was... extraordinary. And the memory lingers.</string>
  <string id="6113932">But you are a man unlike any other, Hawke. With you it might be different.</string>
  <string id="6113933">But you are unlike any woman I have ever met. With you it might be different.</string>
  <string id="6113934">We could find out.</string>
  <string id="6113935">I'm willing.</string>
  <string id="6113936">On another evening, perhaps.</string>
  <string id="6113940">Stop right there.</string>
  <string id="6113941">There's no need to continue.</string>
  <string id="6113944">I don't think so, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6113947">Don't take this the wrong way, but...</string>
  <string id="6113950">Of course. The wine made me bold, nothing more.</string>
  <string id="6113953">Ah. I thought... no, pay me no heed.</string>
  <string id="6113956">I'm not sure we should...</string>
  <string id="6113957">This is a little sudden.</string>
  <string id="6113958">Of course. A conversation for another time, perhaps.</string>
  <string id="6113961">But nothing. This isn't a bonding moment.</string>
  <string id="6113962">We're not friends.</string>
  <string id="6113963">You don't need to say it. I understand.</string>
  <string id="6113964">You had to tell someone.</string>
  <string id="6113965">To much wine will make anyone chatty.</string>
  <string id="6113966">But you're drunk?</string>
  <string id="6113967">Let's just say you've earned my respect.</string>
  <string id="6113970">A last toast, then: to the fallen.</string>
  <string id="6113975">You can always ask.</string>
  <string id="6113978">Oh, this should be good.</string>
  <string id="6113981">It should be a small matter, but I worry.</string>
  <string id="6113984">I need you to give something to Guardsman Donnic. Here, in the barracks. No questions, and he is not to know it's from me.</string>
  <string id="6113985">Donnic? The one we pulled from an ambush?</string>
  <string id="6113986">This is the guard we rescued?</string>
  <string id="6113987">The event that put me here. But this is... a different need of the guard and its captain.</string>
  <string id="6113990">And you're doing very badly at the no questions part.</string>
  <string id="6113991">I should know who I'm dealing with.</string>
  <string id="6113992">Who is Donnic?</string>
  <string id="6113993">Bad start to the no questions rule. Fine.</string>
  <string id="6113996">Sure, he was almost killed a few years ago, but the previous captain took risks as a rule. We all have scars.</string>
  <string id="6114000">It must be something important if you're going to all this trouble.</string>
  <string id="6114001">What's the package?</string>
  <string id="6114002">That's none of your business.</string>
  <string id="6114005">Make it my business.</string>
  <string id="6114008">That seems abrupt, even for you.</string>
  <string id="6114011">How very Qunari of you.</string>
  <string id="6114014">I already regret this. I'm not about to make it worse by... exposing unnecessary facts.</string>
  <string id="6114017">You can accept that or not, but that's all I can say.</string>
  <string id="6114018">You need me for something as simple as this?</string>
  <string id="6114019">Why don't you assign someone?</string>
  <string id="6114020">I protect many people—citizens well beyond the men and women I command.</string>
  <string id="6114023">But... who do I really know besides you?</string>
  <string id="6114026">I need a friend to do this. It's a short list.</string>
  <string id="6114028">All right.</string>
  <string id="6114030">No. I'm not a messenger.</string>
  <string id="6114031">I really have better things to do. You know that.</string>
  <string id="6114034">All right, Hawke. I'll shelve this for now. It's... not urgent.</string>
  <string id="6114037">Guardsman Donnic is just one of many under my command.</string>
  <string id="6114040">Fine. Give it here.</string>
  <string id="6114043">Very well, Aveline. If it means that much.</string>
  <string id="6114046">If that's all you need, I'll walk the hundred feet to him.</string>
  <string id="6114051">Aveline, I just don't see the need.</string>
  <string id="6114054">He's in your own barracks. Kick it across the floor to him.</string>
  <string id="6114055">I gave the Keeper my word.</string>
  <string id="6114058">I'm glad I could help.</string>
  <string id="6114061">If this is what you wanted, then I'm glad I could be of service.</string>
  <string id="6114064">How about a kiss, then?</string>
  <string id="6114067">You're so sweet, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6114070">I'm sure I could think of a better way for you to thank me.</string>
  <string id="6114073">Thank you. And please, hurry back with his reaction.</string>
  <string id="6114076">I appreciate this, Hawke. I really do.</string>
  <string id="6114079">But, if you change your mind, I don't think I can let this go.</string>
  <string id="6114085">So, how did Donnic react?</string>
  <string id="6114088">As stunned as I was, I'll wager.</string>
  <string id="6114091">As one might expect when confused?</string>
  <string id="6114094">To your garbage, you mean?</string>
  <string id="6114097">I thought it was clear. Metal is strong. Copper ages well. Flowers are soft.</string>
  <string id="6114100">I've clearly gone about this the wrong way. Don't talk to him again.</string>
  <string id="6114110">I... I couldn't do it. What did he say?</string>
  <string id="6114111">You're too strong to trip on your own sword. Find a way to win.</string>
  <string id="6114112">Stop defeating yourself!</string>
  <string id="6114117">It's an adventure!</string>
  <string id="6114124">Not that it really matters to people like you!</string>

&#13;
The limitations put upon my research have greatly hampered progress. With just a few subjects, I could test certain critical hypotheses. However, the information sent about the Architect has proven invaluable to my efforts, and I am pleased to report limited success. As the Architect surmised, considerable untapped power exists within Grey Warden blood. When properly prepared, its effects can be remarkable.&#13;
&#13;
But my research has also revealed some alarming implications, which I've attached in the old Acanthan cipher. I urge you to send this to the First Warden at once.&#13;

  <string id="6114405">Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6114411">She'd do a lot better to just get this fellow alone in a room. Life's too short.</string>
  <string id="6114412">So much doubt. Unusual, but clearly important.</string>
  <string id="6114413">Too many hits to the head. Or not enough.</string>
  <string id="6114414">This is weird. Right?</string>
  <string id="6114415">A few too many knocks to the noggin.</string>
  <string id="6114416">Right.</string>
  <string id="6114417">Just... just hold on to it. If I take it back, I'll change my mind.</string>
  <string id="6114420">You could just have him hauled off.</string>
  <string id="6114423">If you don't, then you don't, but at least it's out of my hands.</string>
  <string id="6114429">A Bitter Pill</string>
  <string id="6114432">So, you've given him sufficient time—has your demon granted everything he promised?</string>
  <string id="6114435">I have driven myself mad asking what it was. World-shattering power? Riches enough to buy all of Kirkwall?</string>
  <string id="6114438">What was worth turning on me? Killing me? Did you even know I would wake alive?</string>
  <string id="6114439">I just played along to get the sloth demon's help. I wasn't going through with it.</string>
  <string id="6114440">It was a ruse.</string>
  <string id="6114451">Obviously, you don't trust me.</string>
  <string id="6114452">Don't question my decisions.</string>
  <string id="6114453">Obviously, I cannot.</string>
  <string id="6114456">I will not be with a man who would sell out himself and an innocent for personal gain.</string>
  <string id="6114459">I will not stay with a woman who would sell out herself and an innocent for personal gain.</string>
  <string id="6114462">Since you're both on such good terms with demons, perhaps Merrill would be more receptive to your advances.</string>
  <string id="6114466">You mean...?</string>
  <string id="6114469">Feynriel isn't possessed. I killed the sloth demon.</string>
  <string id="6114472">I don't know what to say. I assumed you lied to Arianni. It's not easy to dismiss the memory of you striking me down.</string>
  <string id="6114475">But I suppose even had I known your plan, Justice wouldn't listen.</string>
  <string id="6114476">I thought he'd be all for tricking a demon.</string>
  <string id="6114477">He would disapprove?</string>
  <string id="6114478">Justice isn't capable of feigning friendship with a demon to achieve an end.</string>
  <string id="6114479">Do you need someone to mediate between the voices in your head?</string>
  <string id="6114480">You two never talk anymore.</string>
  <string id="6114481">Hmm. There's an idea.</string>
  <string id="6114484">It's sounding more and more like he's the one in charge.</string>
  <string id="6114485">You need to control him.</string>
  <string id="6114486">I've stayed out of the Fade since we merged. I don't like being a passenger in my own skin.</string>
  <string id="6114489">I suppose Justice feels like that every day. Shackled to my body and every decision I make.</string>
  <string id="6114490">If I knew Justice would attack me, I never would have done it.</string>
  <string id="6114491">I never meant to hurt you.</string>
  <string id="6114492">You made a deal with a demon! How did you think a spirit of justice would respond?</string>
  <string id="6114495">What was I supposed to do? Stand there while Justice ripped my head off?</string>
  <string id="6114496">You attacked me!</string>
  <string id="6114497">If you had fought the demon, Justice and I would have both done battle beside you.</string>
  <string id="6114502">I don't deal with demons. I know you know another mage who's not so discriminating.</string>
  <string id="6114505">Perhaps you'd prefer talking to her.</string>
  <string id="6114512">No wonder it's become a prison for him.</string>
  <string id="6114518">Was it that bad?</string>
  <string id="6114524">I'm sorry, it's not... it was fine.</string>
  <string id="6114527">No. That is insufficient. It was better than anything I could have dreamed.</string>
  <string id="6114528">Was it too strange to be with another man?</string>
  <string id="6114529">Is something wrong?</string>
  <string id="6114531">Your markings... they hurt, don't they?</string>
  <string id="6114532">Was it the pain?</string>
  <string id="6114533">This is as far as it goes, then?</string>
  <string id="6114534">But that's it?</string>
  <string id="6114535">It can be a lot to take in, I know.</string>

  <string id="6114794">Sighs All right, I can fix this. I need... I need three goats and a sheaf of wheat. You'll take them to his mother.</string>
  <string id="6114800">It's a dowry tradition. Maybe it will smooth the process.</string>
  <string id="6114803">Hold a moment. You're sweet on the boy.</string>
  <string id="6114806">So help me, whore, I will break you.</string>
  <string id="6114809">Oh, this is glorious. All this flailing is her idea of courtship.</string>
  <string id="6114810">The process? Oh my.</string>
  <string id="6114813">Please. Don't.</string>
  <string id="6114816">It's a courtship. The mother of all awkward ones, but still.</string>
  <string id="6114817">A dowry? Then... this isn't about accusations.</string>
  <string id="6114820">No, it's not.</string>
  <string id="6114823">She's courting the man. With a fear reserved for dragons.</string>
  <string id="6114824">Don't be silly. A dowry would only matter if you were courting him.</string>
  <string id="6114827">Merrill...</string>
  <string id="6114830">You're courting him!</string>
  <string id="6114831">I think my jaw just landed in the Deep Roads somewhere.</string>
  <string id="6114834">Not a word, dwarf.</string>
  <string id="6114837">I wouldn't dream of mocking your... unconventional courtship.</string>
  <string id="6114838">Wait, you think these idiocies were courtship?</string>
  <string id="6114841">A dowry? You're trying to court him?</string>
  <string id="6114844">Something along those lines, yes.</string>
  <string id="6114845">So this ridiculous investigation was...</string>
  <string id="6114848">A ridiculous courtship.</string>
  <string id="6114849">I don't appreciate being led around like this.</string>
  <string id="6114850">You lied to me?</string>
  <string id="6114851">Aveline. You know you can talk to me.</string>
  <string id="6114852">Why not just tell me?</string>
  <string id="6114853">What am I to say? That a grown woman can't speak her mind?</string>
  <string id="6114854">How, exactly, did you think this mess would work?</string>
  <string id="6114855">This makes no sense.</string>
  <string id="6114856">I don't know what I thought. I've been focused on being captain for so long, that's all I know.</string>
  <string id="6114862">That was… a long time ago. It was easier. Or seemed to be.</string>
  <string id="6114865">The guards are in my care. I hurt when they hurt. But Donnic...</string>
  <string id="6114868">I'm confused. Wasn't lady man-hands married already?</string>
  <string id="6114869">It can't be a complete mystery. You were married once, right?</string>
  <string id="6114870">But you were married, were you not?</string>
  <string id="6114871">But you've done it before. I mean, been married.</string>
  <string id="6114872">Correct me if I'm about to get punched, but weren't you married?</string>
  <string id="6114873">But you were married.</string>
  <string id="6114919">I like the doggie.</string>
  <string id="6114922">Bark?</string>
  <string id="6114925">Barks</string>
  <string id="6114928">Barks</string>
  <string id="6114941">Huh. Looks like they're having a nice chat.</string>
  <string id="6114944">Maybe Sandal picked up some mabari-speak from our time at the Hero of Ferelden's camp.</string>
  <string id="6114950">Now that I'm living here, there isn't room for you in the bed. Do you understand?</string>
  <string id="6115007">This isn't combat. I can't talk to him. The only place I'm comfortable anymore is on patrol.</string>
  <string id="6115013">And killing highwaymen doesn't afford much opportunity for banter.</string>
  <string id="6115016">And I'm tired of embarrassing myself.</string>
  <string id="6115035">That ruckus has been going on for some time. Can you go calm him down?</string>
  <string id="6115063">Whines</string>
  <string id="6115067">Cheer up, old boy. Maybe you can bunk with Sandal!</string>
  <string id="6115071">Anders requested help searching for proof of the Tranquil solution, but was refused.</string>
  <string id="6115072">Enchantment!</string>
  <string id="6115075">Happy bark!</string>
  <string id="6115080">That won't work on me. I'm a cat person.</string>
  <string id="6115096">I'd like to speak with you about our... sleeping arrangements.</string>
  <string id="6115099">Do you think he could use another bed?</string>
  <string id="6115100">Does he take up too much space at the foot of the bed?</string>
  <string id="6115101">Not enough room?</string>
  <string id="6115112">Is it because he watches us when we... you know?</string>
  <string id="6115113">He makes you uncomfortable?</string>
  <string id="6115114">There's plenty of room. It's not like we're sleeping in a tent.</string>
  <string id="6115115">What's the problem?</string>
  <string id="6115119">Whines</string>
  <string id="6115121">Well, it's just that... he snores. And sometimes... he stinks like a bog.</string>
  <string id="6115124">Whimpers</string>
  <string id="6115127">Oh don't be sad. I still like you very much. Perhaps you could sleep with Sandal?</string>
  <string id="6115271">You've been nosing around outside your commission?</string>
  <string id="6115272">How did you find out?</string>
  <string id="6115273">I have contacts, and they're complaining about a lack of meat—-thugs and such. Someone is hiring.</string>
  <string id="6115276">And, one or two were told to prepare for travelers.</string>
  <string id="6115279">You want to be good at this job, you pay attention to what's missing, and when people arrange escape routes.</string>
  <string id="6115281">Head for the general area. Once we're close, I'll track the actual ambush site.</string>
  <string id="6115292">I began to remember. My life before. Just flashes...</string>
  <string id="6115295">It's too much. This is too fast. I cannot... do this.</string>
  <string id="6115296">Your life before? What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="6115297">What did you remember?</string>
  <string id="6115298">I've never remembered anything from before the ritual. But there were... faces. Words.</string>
  <string id="6115301">For just a moment, I could recall all of it. And then it slipped away.</string>
  <string id="6115308">So you're ending it.</string>
  <string id="6115309">I see where this is going.</string>
  <string id="6115312">You're going to leave.</string>
  <string id="6115315">It isn't you, it's me?</string>
  <string id="6115318">I wasn't expecting anything else, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6115319">I didn't want more.</string>
  <string id="6115320">Then... perhaps this is for the best.</string>
  <string id="6115323">I need to leave.</string>
  <string id="6115326">We can work through this.</string>
  <string id="6115327">But I care about you.</string>
  <string id="6115328">I'm sorry. I feel like such a fool.</string>
  <string id="6115331">All I wanted was to be happy... just for a little while. Forgive me.</string>
  <string id="6115332">This should never have happened in the first place. Forgive me.</string>
  <string id="6115337">I have been thinking about what happened in the Fade.</string>
  <string id="6115340">That a demon could have played so easily on my fears... disturbs me.</string>
  <string id="6115343">I failed you. I won't let that happen again.</string>
  <string id="6115344">I have to admit, I was surprised.</string>
  <string id="6115345">That's good to hear.</string>
  <string id="6115346">No more so than myself.</string>
  <string id="6115349">The demon was using magic on your mind, it's as simple as that.</string>
  <string id="6115350">It wasn't your fault.</string>
  <string id="6115351">And yet she didn't manage to influence you.</string>
  <string id="6115354">Everyone gets one free demonic possession before I hold it against them.</string>
  <string id="6115355">Don't worry about it.</string>
  <string id="6115356">Good to know.</string>
  <string id="6115359">As for the boy, we shall see what he becomes, and if he regrets the mercy you provided.</string>
  <string id="6115362">The boy met a sad end—one I hope you took to heart. Many mages meet such a fate.</string>
  <string id="6115365">But that is not important now. Let's just hope we face nothing similar in the future.</string>
  <string id="6115368">I apologized for my weakness, but the more I think about it, the more I believe you are also to blame.</string>
  <string id="6115371">Why did you take me into the Fade? We should have hunted the boy's body down and killed him.</string>
  <string id="6115372">If you didn't want to come, you should have said so.</string>
  <string id="6115373">You were willing.</string>
  <string id="6115374">I was willing to stand by your side. You shouldn't have been there in the first place.</string>
  <string id="6115377">If the boy could be helped, I had to do something.</string>
  <string id="6115378">Feynriel deserved a chance.</string>
  <string id="6115379">Might you have mentioned this brilliant plan earlier?</string>
  <string id="6115380">A little late now.</string>
  <string id="6115381">You are strong, Hawke. But not all mages are like you.</string>
  <string id="6115384">One day you will learn that not every mage is worth saving, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6115387">I simply hope we don't all regret the day you learn just how true that is.</string>
  <string id="6115390">Maybe we're not friends, but who else do I have?</string>
  <string id="6115393">I've been focused on being captain for so long, that's all I know.</string>
  <string id="6115396">So you've been by yourself since we came to Kirkwall?</string>
  <string id="6115397">You've been alone this long?</string>
  <string id="6115401">Wait, you've gone four years without? You must creak like a rusty hinge.</string>
  <string id="6115406">I can't imagine you having trouble speaking your mind.</string>
  <string id="6115407">Why is this difficult for you?</string>
  <string id="6115408">It's just... fear. I know it's foolish, but I can't get away from it.</string>
  <string id="6115411">What about you and Fenris? How do you deal with the danger of your lives?</string>
  <string id="6115414">What about you and Isabela? I know she doesn't have two thoughts to rub together, but the danger of your lives must worry you.</string>
  <string id="6115417">What about you and Anders? He's all but cursed. How do you live with that danger?</string>
  <string id="6115420">What about you and Merrill? She's all but daring the Fade to take her. How do you live with that danger?</string>
  <string id="6115426">Maybe we're not the best example.</string>
  <string id="6115432">I want him to know that I feel... but if something happened to him...</string>
  <string id="6115435">Something already happened and he's fine.</string>
  <string id="6115438">He's a guard, like you. He can handle himself.</string>
  <string id="6115441">If it made sense, I wouldn't need you. I feel paralyzed. I hate it.</string>
  <string id="6115451">I have enough problems without playing matchmaker.</string>
  <string id="6115452">I'm not helping.</string>
  <string id="6115453">I can drag him in here right now. Just say the word.</string>
  <string id="6115454">I could just tell him.</string>
  <string id="6115455">Well, this little dance certainly isn't helping. So what will?</string>
  <string id="6115456">If you need this, I'll help.</string>
  <string id="6115457">I'm the captain. He's my guardsman. I can't get past that.</string>
  <string id="6115464">Oh, and how would that look! The captain ordering her guardsman to... to... it wouldn't help.</string>
  <string id="6115470">So go where you're not captain and guardsman.</string>
  <string id="6115473">What, just... go out somewhere? Like it's that easy?</string>
  <string id="6115474">What? Too simple?</string>
  <string id="6115475">Yes, it can be.</string>
  <string id="6115476">Tell Donnic... invite him to the Hanged Man.</string>
  <string id="6115479">Don't tell him about me, make something up. It's a surprise, or just you, or a group. Anything to get him there.</string>
  <string id="6115482">He's not like the others. I don't want him to think he's meeting the captain.</string>
  <string id="6115485">If you can't commit to even that, you may as well quit now.</string>
  <string id="6115486">Then don't try at all.</string>
  <string id="6115487">Wait! Hawke... tell Donnic... invite him to the Hanged Man.</string>
  <string id="6115490">It's not about you. It's not about anyone. Just me.</string>
  <string id="6115496">Many people have their lives because of me.</string>
  <string id="6115497">I am... diligent on behalf of my men. And I've neglected many other things.</string>
  <string id="6115498">What makes Donnic so special when someone closer to you might be interested?</string>
  <string id="6115499">Why him and not someone else?</string>
  <string id="6115500">Nothing. Not a thing. Not rich, not the most skilled, I daresay he's not even the best looking.</string>
  <string id="6115503">But he's... something. He's not like the others.</string>
  <string id="6115506">He thinks I'm interested in him.</string>
  <string id="6115509">He thinks I arranged this to get to you.</string>
  <string id="6115512">I'm an idiot.</string>
  <string id="6115514">If you were that far gone, you'd have hidden from the start.</string>
  <string id="6115515">You know that's not true.</string>
  <string id="6115551">Something is wrong. This was where the spirit was bound. But now, it feels... empty.</string>
  <string id="6115555">They're looking for us, Uncle.</string>
  <string id="6115558">I hoped to avoid violence, but the templars are determined to make that impossible.</string>
  <string id="6115561">You're not with the templars, are you? Can you help us?</string>
  <string id="6115562">I'm not with them. What's going on?</string>
  <string id="6115563">I might help.</string>
  <string id="6115564">Oh, just attack the templars? You know they practically run this city, right?</string>
  <string id="6115565">Fight the templars?</string>
  <string id="6115566">I'm all too aware.</string>
  <string id="6115569">I don't know you. I have no reason to help.</string>
  <string id="6115570">Why should I?</string>
  <string id="6115571">My name is Arl Teagan.</string>
  <string id="6115574">My name is Bann Teagan.</string>
  <string id="6115577">And this is my nephew, Connor.</string>
  <string id="6115580">Uncle, they're here for me. I caused enough suffering at Redcliffe. If you are harmed...</string>
  <string id="6115583">Loghain and Jowan are to blame, not you. I will not let these templars imprison you.</string>
  <string id="6115588">I take it your nephew is a mage?</string>
  <string id="6115589">Why do they want Connor?</string>
  <string id="6115590">I'm a mage of the Circle Tower of Ferelden.</string>
  <string id="6115593">There's no use keeping it a secret. Yes, I'm a mage.</string>
  <string id="6115596">Years ago, I fell prey to a demon. I did... unspeakable things.</string>
  <string id="6115599">The Kirkwall templars must have learned of that incident.</string>
  <string id="6115602">Connor is a good boy. A good man.</string>
  <string id="6115609">A fight's inevitable. I won't kill any templars for you.</string>
  <string id="6115610">I won't fight templars.</string>
  <string id="6115611">What's the plan?</string>
  <string id="6115612">I'll help.</string>
  <string id="6115616">We made it.</string>
  <string id="6115619">We must get below decks, Uncle.</string>
  <string id="6115623">Hand over the abomination.</string>
  <string id="6115626">He's not possessed, you fool. You have no right!</string>
  <string id="6115629">The Maker will shed no tears if the boy and his uncle die. Attack!</string>
  <string id="6115632">We just need to make it to the ship.</string>
  <string id="6115633">Our ship isn't far. Once we're aboard, we should be safe.</string>
  <string id="6115636">Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6115712">Gallows Dungeon</string>
  <string id="6115713">Darktown</string>
  <string id="6115715">Darktown</string>
  <string id="6115719">Gallows Dungeon</string>
  <string id="6115729">Gallows Dungeon</string>
  <string id="6115733">What was it you wanted me to do again?</string>
  <string id="6115734">Can you refresh my memory?</string>
  <string id="6115735">You... don't remember?</string>
  <string id="6115738">My sons went down into the Deep Roads after hearing stories about you and Varric finding your fortunes down there!</string>
  <string id="6115741">I'm begging you, please find them before the darkspawn do!</string>
  <string id="6115752">No one ever understood. Not the Keeper, not my clan... just you.</string>
  <string id="6115753">Considering how they've treated you, I'd say they're not worth all your trouble.</string>
  <string id="6115754">They're idiots.</string>
  <string id="6115755">When the eluvian is finished, they'll appreciate all you've done for them.</string>
  <string id="6115756">They'll come around.</string>
  <string id="6115757">I'm sensitive, handsome, and supportive. What else could you possibly want?</string>
  <string id="6115758">I'm a great guy.</string>
  <string id="6115762">We cannot let this man escape justice.</string>
  <string id="6115765">Abandoned Slaver Den</string>
  <string id="6115769">But poor you, no life of your own.</string>
  <string id="6115772">We both place others above ourselves. I happen to do it clothed.</string>
  <string id="6115775">You're splitting hairs, but wishing someone would split yours.</string>
  <string id="6115778">I've had enough of your loose lips. Like many, I'm sure.</string>
  <string id="6115780">And you still wish to take him back to the guard?</string>
  <string id="6115781">Let's take him back to the guard and be done with him.</string>
  <string id="6115782">Easier to bury a knife in his ribs than drag him back to the guard.</string>
  <string id="6115783">Let's get him back to the guard before he tries any more foolishness.</string>
  <string id="6115784">Let's get him back to the guard. I don't want to look at him anymore.</string>
  <string id="6115785">Let's take him to the guard and get this over with.</string>
  <string id="6115786">You sure you don't want to stab him before we take him back to the guard? At least once?</string>
  <string id="6115787">That's enough. I'm taking you to the guard.</string>
  <string id="6115788">What can I say? I'd do anything to help someone as sweet as you, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6115789">I'm a great girl.</string>
  <string id="6115792">Hawke?</string>
  <string id="6115797">I can't give up on them. They need me, even if they don't know it.</string>
  <string id="6115798">It's all right. Even if they hate me forever, I'll know I helped them.</string>
  <string id="6115799">Nothing! Oh, not that I'm saying that I want you... I'll just stop talking now.</string>
  <string id="6115800">You're too good to me. I don't deserve you.</string>
  <string id="6115813">Search the hideout to find Magister Hadriana.</string>
  <string id="6115816">Oh, touché. Prig!</string>
  <string id="6115819">If I might put this back on track.</string>
  <string id="6115820">Blood Sacrifice</string>
  <string id="6115832">You're the first real friend I've ever had.</string>
  <string id="6115835">Ma serannas, lethallin.</string>
  <string id="6115836">Ma serannas, lethallan.</string>
  <string id="6115857">Slattern!</string>
  <string id="6115860">But you understand. I feel paralyzed. I hate it.</string>
  <string id="6115863">If any of us could choose, it'd be so much easier.</string>
  <string id="6115864">So go out. Get him drunk. Shame is a great equalizer.</string>
  <string id="6115865">Let him decide if that bothers him.</string>
  <string id="6115866">If the existing relationship prevents a new one, go somewhere you are equal.</string>
  <string id="6115867">Being in the barracks doesn't help. Go somewhere you can talk.</string>
  <string id="6115868">There are places in this city where no one cares that you're captain.</string>
  <string id="6115872">Oh! Hawke! Come in. I... was just...</string>
  <string id="6115875">Am I crazy?</string>
  <string id="6115878">What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="6115879">What? No, of course not.</string>
  <string id="6115880">Yes, but in a good way.</string>
  <string id="6115894">Let's find this idiot before he gets himself killed.</string>
  <string id="6115895">I suppose we should go after him.</string>
  <string id="6115896">Let's find this idiot before he gets himself killed.</string>
  <string id="6115897">This man is getting on my nerves. Let's get after him, then.</string>
  <string id="6115898">So are we going after him, or what?</string>
  <string id="6115899">Now we have to run after him?</string>
  <string id="6115936">Who could blame you? Farewell.</string>
  <string id="6115941">You remind me of someone... I hold dear. Though I never had the courage to say that to her.</string>
  <string id="6115944">You're very brave. Take this, with my blessings.</string>
  <string id="6115953">I thought the arulin'holm would fix everything. The mirror would work, and everything would be right again...</string>
  <string id="6115956">But I keep dreaming of Pol's face.</string>
  <string id="6115959">Everyone that I care for thinks I'm a monster.</string>
  <string id="6115960">If they don't appreciate you, it's their loss.</string>
  <string id="6115961">Forget about them.</string>
  <string id="6115962">What happened in that cave wasn't your fault. Pol did that to himself.</string>
  <string id="6115963">You didn't kill Pol.</string>
  <string id="6115964">I don't think you're a monster, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6115965">Everyone?</string>
  <string id="6115969">An inactive golem.</string>
  <string id="6115970">Golem</string>
  <string id="6115977">Use the control rod.</string>
  <string id="6115979">Leave the golem alone.</string>
  <string id="6115980">Even if they've given up on me, I can't do the same. I suppose... that means I'm not really like them.</string>
  <string id="6115983">I know. But I caused it. Or the clan did, filling his head with terrible stories about me.</string>
  <string id="6115986">I don't know what I would do without you.</string>
  <string id="6115995">It's hard to imagine someone more loveable than you.</string>
  <string id="6115996">No one could think that.</string>
  <string id="6115997">That's so untrue. I can think of someone...</string>
  <string id="6116000">I... you've been so good to me.</string>
  <string id="6116003">You're a true friend, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6116006">Someday, I'll make this up to you, lethallin.</string>
  <string id="6116007">I'll find a way to make this up to you, lethallan. That's a promise.</string>
  <string id="6116010">Oh, thank goodness you're here! I thought you went to the Hanged Man.</string>
  <string id="6116011">By the Dread Wolf! Why is my house always such a mess when people are here? It's clean sometimes, I swear!</string>
  <string id="6116013">Orana</string>
  <string id="6116032">I don't need you, or Marethari, or anyone else to look after me!</string>
  <string id="6116040">Back at my house... I should never have said—</string>
  <string id="6116043">I didn't mean it.</string>
  <string id="6116044">I never want to see you again, doesn't leave much room for interpretation.</string>
  <string id="6116045">Then what did you mean?</string>
  <string id="6116046">People say a lot of things when they're angry. I knew you didn't mean it.</string>
  <string id="6116047">I already forgave you.</string>
  <string id="6116048">I get thrown out of houses so often, I hardly even notice anymore. No harm done.</string>
  <string id="6116049">I get that a lot.</string>
  <string id="6116052">And I almost went there to look for you first, but then I thought you might have gone to see your uncle instead...</string>
  <string id="6116055">And I'm rambling, aren't I?</string>
  <string id="6116056">As usual.</string>
  <string id="6116057">Yes, you are.</string>
  <string id="6116058">Why were you looking for me, Merrill?</string>
  <string id="6116059">What's the matter?</string>
  <string id="6116060">I don't mind. You're adorable when you're flustered.</string>
  <string id="6116061">It's cute.</string>
  <string id="6116063">I have taken every possible precaution.</string>
  <string id="6116065">Magister Hadriana</string>
  <string id="6116069">I can save my people with this mirror! Just stay out of it!</string>
  <string id="6116070">Someone has to be there when this falls apart.</string>
  <string id="6116071">You need me.</string>
  <string id="6116072">Do you really want me to leave you alone?</string>
  <string id="6116073">Is that what you want?</string>
  <string id="6116074">Is it really so bad to have someone watching out for you?</string>
  <string id="6116075">You don't have to do it alone.</string>
  <string id="6116078">I don't want you thinking about me that way.</string>
  <string id="6116079">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6116080">Everyone wants to control my thoughts...</string>
  <string id="6116083">Fine. I hear you, strictly professional.</string>
  <string id="6116084">You... and Karl?</string>
  <string id="6116085">Together?</string>
  <string id="6116089">Have you found Emeric yet?</string>
  <string id="6116090">I hope Emeric isn't in trouble.</string>
  <string id="6116091">Emeric should have let the investigation go when Meredith told him to.</string>
  <string id="6116095">Maker watch over you.</string>
  <string id="6116096">Keep safe, and come back at soon as possible.</string>
  <string id="6116097">I hope you find something that proves I haven't been imagining things.</string>
  <string id="6116099">I've always believed people fall in love with a whole person, not just a body.</string>
  <string id="6116102">Does it bother you that I've... been with men?</string>
  <string id="6116103">Let's not speak of this again.</string>
  <string id="6116104">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6116105">I just had... never considered...</string>
  <string id="6116106">I've never thought about it.</string>
  <string id="6116107">Well, perhaps I'll give you time to consider, then... In as much detail as you fancy.</string>
  <string id="6116110">This is hardly the time or place, anyway.</string>
  <string id="6116113">Not after Karl...</string>
  <string id="6116114">I'm just glad it didn't take me any longer to find out.</string>
  <string id="6116115">No.</string>
  <string id="6116119">It's hard to believe Karl is dead. And at my hand.</string>
  <string id="6116122">Damn the templars! I should have come to Kirkwall sooner.</string>
  <string id="6116128">I was afraid of this.</string>
  <string id="6116129">That thing was sent to kill him.</string>
  <string id="6116130">A templar should be able defend himself from a magical creature. If he was any good at it.</string>
  <string id="6116131">Oh, poor Emeric.</string>
  <string id="6116132">I hope you weren't expecting to find him alive.</string>
  <string id="6116133">Someone didn't like him poking his nose into their business.</string>
  <string id="6116134">The other templars are going to want to hear about this.</string>
  <string id="6116135">I warn you, though. I'm not a safe man to get involved with. I'll hurt you.</string>
  <string id="6116136">They'll pay for what they did.</string>
  <string id="6116137">Those bastards!</string>
  <string id="6116138">Well, pardon me!</string>
  <string id="6116141">Fenris stormed off and will not be found in his home. Go to your Hightown mansion to hear more from him.</string>
  <string id="6116145">I am trying to save my people! Why can't you understand that?</string>
  <string id="6116146">You're not saving anyone! You're putting everyone around you in jeopardy.</string>
  <string id="6116147">You're endangering everyone.</string>
  <string id="6116148">I don't want to see you get hurt.</string>
  <string id="6116149">I'm trying to protect you.</string>
  <string id="6116150">You're trying to save them with an evil mirror and blood magic! That doesn't strike you as unlikely to work?</string>
  <string id="6116151">Because it's crazy.</string>
  <string id="6116155">You know how it is.</string>
  <string id="6116158">Still creepy.</string>
  <string id="6116159">That doesn't make it better.</string>
  <string id="6116160">Fine! What would you do? How would you try to stand against the templars?</string>
  <string id="6116163">You're lucky they never found you. Most of us, they hunt us down before we've even learned our letters.</string>
  <string id="6116166">How can you say that? You should know better than anyone!</string>
  <string id="6116169">Doesn't every mage deserve the freedom you've had?</string>
  <string id="6116172">Darktown</string>
  <string id="6116174">Here come the excuses.</string>
  <string id="6116177">I will not risk...</string>
  <string id="6116180">That's the problem. Risk, or so help me, I will bed the man myself!</string>
  <string id="6116181">Then I'll clear the way and you'll talk to Donnic.</string>
  <string id="6116182">No excuses! Arrange a patrol.</string>
  <string id="6116183">Putting you in danger just makes it worse.</string>
  <string id="6116189">I think that pretty much forces the issue.</string>
  <string id="6116190">A friendly ultimatum.</string>
  <string id="6116191">But I can't fight and talk...</string>
  <string id="6116194">I'll clear the way and you can see if he's the one.</string>
  <string id="6116197">You're too good at this. Is it any wonder you've all but taken Hightown?</string>
  <string id="6116198">Again, she deflects.</string>
  <string id="6116199">More excuses?</string>
  <string id="6116200">Come on, you want this!</string>
  <string id="6116201">It's ringing a little hollow, girl.</string>
  <string id="6116202">And if you run away, they hunt you down. Again and again and again.</string>
  <string id="6116203">Rage demons. They seek the dreamer's power.</string>
  <string id="6116207">No.</string>
  <string id="6116210">I am Justice. Anders has told you of me.</string>
  <string id="6116213">Come. I sense Feynriel's mind straining. We will not have much time.</string>
  <string id="6116214">I had not thought to return in such a way.</string>
  <string id="6116217">It is good to feel the breath of the Fade again, not the empty air of your world.</string>
  <string id="6116222">A Reply from Starkhaven</string>
  <string id="6116223">Meredith's Apology</string>
  <string id="6116224">A Thank You Note</string>
  <string id="6116225">A demon of sloth. It exists to make men forget their purpose and their pride—do not relax around it!</string>

Thank you kindly for your last shipment. It arrived in almost perfect condition. The requested payment is on its way. Please use the artifact with care. The creatures can be difficult to control, even for an experienced mage.&#13;

A pleasure doing business,&#13;
Your friend</string>

  <string id="6116251">I have made this place a sanctum of healing and salvation. Why do you threaten it?</string>

  <string id="6116255">You will never take another mage as you took him!</string>

  <string id="6116278">Messere DuPuis,&#13;
&#13;
Please accept my humble apologies for recent events. The templar, Emeric, has been reprimanded for his wrongful accusations and for arousing suspicions within the city guard that led to the raid on your estate. I will see that he is restrained in future.&#13;
&#13;
Sincerely yours, &#13;
Knight-Commander Meredith</string>
  <string id="6116279">Messere DuPuis,&#13;
&#13;
This is in regards to your inquiry into missing mages. I would like to remind you that the duty of seeking out missing mages, if there were any to begin with, would fall to the templars of Starkhaven, not a minor nobleman from Kirkwall. &#13;
&#13;
I would also like to take this opportunity to remind you that the Circle of the Magi, as a whole, does not welcome casual inquiries about the mages in its care. &#13;
&#13;
Thank you,&#13;
First Enchanter Raddick</string>
  <string id="6116280">There can be no peace.</string>
  <string id="6116283">There can be no turning back.</string>
  <string id="6116286">The Circle has failed us, Orsino! Even you should be able to see that!</string>
  <string id="6116289">The time has come to act. There can be no half-measures.</string>
  <string id="6116303">Perhaps you could stop jerking me around and tell me where your son is.</string>
  <string id="6116304">Tell me the truth.</string>
  <string id="6116311">Your boys don't sound bright enough to follow a map. I'm sure they didn't get too far.</string>
  <string id="6116312">Your sons sound like morons.</string>
  <string id="6116313">You made it my problem. I'm fixing it.</string>
  <string id="6116314">Have you seen any harm I've done? Have you any proof, or is it just your fear talking?</string>
  <string id="6116316">It can work! It will work!</string>
  <string id="6116317">Stop trying to save me!</string>
  <string id="6116318">Why is it everyone questions what I want when I've just said it?</string>
  <string id="6116319">You're not trying to help me. You're trying to sabotage my work!</string>
  <string id="6116321">My boys aren't stupid. Foolhardy, maybe. But not stupid.</string>
  <string id="6116324">You're the only one who knows where they went. They were following the path of your expedition. </string>
  <string id="6116327">Dead Refugee</string>
  <string id="6116329">Tread carefully, lethallin. May the Trickster never find you in the beyond.</string>
  <string id="6116332">Oh, Harshal... I'm so sorry. I'll tell Ineria for you...</string>
  <string id="6116337">Falon'Din guide you, lethallan.</string>
  <string id="6116359">Right. Let's clear this route so our lovebirds have nothing to do but talk.</string>
  <string id="6116362">If this doesn't work, I'm drugging them both.</string>
  <string id="6116363">Love will be in the air. Also, arrows.</string>
  <string id="6116364">There are worse reasons to fight. Several better, I wager, but so it goes.</string>
  <string id="6116365">A clumsy affair, but fitting, I suppose.</string>
  <string id="6116366">This is so exciting! Do you think they'll kiss? I hope they kiss.</string>
  <string id="6116370">Aveline's patrol route for her and Donnic. Make way for romance.</string>
  <string id="6116373">You're squandering something you don't understand.</string>
  <string id="6116374">Then you will have nothing.</string>
  <string id="6116375">But... look at you two.</string>
  <string id="6116376">Come on, look what you're denying the boy.</string>
  <string id="6116378">That's his room over there.</string>
  <string id="6116384">The cave must be near camp. The Keeper would just warn the hunters away, otherwise.</string>
  <string id="6116388">Pol... what was he thinking? He acted like I was a monster...</string>
  <string id="6116389">The way everyone looked at me in the camp when we arrived...</string>
  <string id="6116390">I've never hurt the clan!</string>
  <string id="6116394">You are a monster.</string>
  <string id="6116395">Don't blame yourself, Kitten. Sometimes men do senseless things.</string>
  <string id="6116396">Maybe he was thinking, Aaah! Blood mage! That seems the most likely scenario.</string>
  <string id="6116400">What have they been saying about me? They must think I'm worse than the Blight!</string>
  <string id="6116406">Very well, Hawke. You pushed.</string>
  <string id="6116409">You'll have the route. And I will live to regret this, I'm sure.</string>
  <string id="6116410">You can't ignore advice from such a stable source.</string>
  <string id="6116411">Trust your friends.</string>
  <string id="6116412">Would it have ended any worse?</string>
  <string id="6116418">I need to talk to him, but I'm a mess unless I'm on patrol. I'm good at that.</string>
  <string id="6116421">Killing highwaymen doesn't exactly provide an intimate setting, though.</string>
  <string id="6116428">I think you're on to something, there.</string>
  <string id="6116429">Trust me to help.</string>
  <string id="6116444">You'll have the route. And I... will think of something to say.</string>
  <string id="6116452">They had no reason to be afraid of me! None of this makes any sense.</string>
  <string id="6116473">I didn't mean for it to affect you.</string>
  <string id="6116476">Well it has, but no longer.</string>
  <string id="6116482">All right, Hawke. No more. I need to focus on what's important, as I always have.</string>
  <string id="6116485">I won't trouble you with it again.</string>
  <string id="6116486">Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6116491">Growls</string>
  <string id="6116492">Easy, boy. What is it?</string>
  <string id="6116493">What's the matter?</string>
  <string id="6116494">I'm sure the furniture's very sorry for whatever it did, old boy.</string>
  <string id="6116495">What did the wardrobe do?</string>
  <string id="6116496">Be quiet!</string>
  <string id="6116497">Stop that.</string>
  <string id="6116505">Varania said she would wait at the Hanged Man until my coin ran out.</string>
  <string id="6116511">Are you certain it's her?</string>
  <string id="6116514">An elf matching your description, on the ship you named. And alone, as far as I could tell.</string>
  <string id="6116517">I need to know if it's a trap!</string>
  <string id="6116520">I did as you asked, Fenris. Now it's up to you.</string>
  <string id="6116526">You talk to him, Hawke. I've had my fill for today.</string>
  <string id="6116529">Venhedis! Fasta vass!</string>
  <string id="6116530">Swearing won't accomplish anything. </string>
  <string id="6116531">Calm down.</string>
  <string id="6116532">Maybe I can help, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6116533">What's wrong?</string>
  <string id="6116534">Maybe it's just me, but I'd swear you're upset.</string>
  <string id="6116535">Problems?</string>
  <string id="6116536">Sighs It's my sister.</string>
  <string id="6116539">I didn't tell you, but I followed up on Hadriana's information. Everything she said was true.</string>
  <string id="6116542">I had to keep it quiet, but I eventually contacted Varania and sent her coin enough to come meet me. And now she's here.</string>
  <string id="6116543">She was in Qarinus after all?</string>
  <string id="6116544">Where did you find her?</string>
  <string id="6116545">My sister left Magister Ahriman's service, and I found her in Minrathous. That made things more difficult.</string>
  <string id="6116548">But according to the men I paid, it's just as Hadriana said: she's not a slave. She's a tailor, in fact.</string>
  <string id="6116551">Getting a letter to her was difficult, and she didn't believe me at first... but she's finally come.</string>
  <string id="6116552">Just standing here won't help.</string>
  <string id="6116553">So go and meet her.</string>
  <string id="6116554">It's not that easy.</string>
  <string id="6116557">You're worried Danarius knows?</string>
  <string id="6116558">You think it's a trap.</string>
  <string id="6116559">The more it seems he doesn't know, the more certain I become he does!</string>
  <string id="6116562">Yes, everything's gone exactly according to plan. What could be worse?</string>
  <string id="6116563">So, what's the problem?</string>
  <string id="6116564">Yes, yes, laugh at me.</string>
  <string id="6116567">Come with me, Hawke. I need you there when I meet her.</string>
  <string id="6116568">Come with me, Hawke. If this is a trap, I need someone who can fight to back me up.</string>
  <string id="6116569">Where is she?</string>
  <string id="6116570">Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6116572">Forget it.</string>
  <string id="6116573">I'm not going, and neither should you.</string>
  <string id="6116576">It's too dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6116579">You think I don't have better things to do?</string>
  <string id="6116582">I can't stop now. Varania's already waiting for me.</string>
  <string id="6116585">I thought you said there was no point in meeting her.</string>
  <string id="6116586">Are you sure?</string>
  <string id="6116587">I can't simply leave it like this. I have to know.</string>
  <string id="6116590">If we go to the Hanged Man during the day, she'll be there. For the next week, at least.</string>
  <string id="6116593">It would mean a lot to me. That's all I ask.</string>
  <string id="6116594">I know you owe me no favors, but if we happen to go there anyway...</string>
  <string id="6116598">Admitting it is a good step. Where are you heading next?</string>
  <string id="6116599">I won't argue with that.</string>
  <string id="6116600">The barracks. Ferelden? The deepest hole I can find?</string>
  <string id="6116603">You've never been the hiding type.</string>
  <string id="6116606">I know, all right, but I freeze up. The only place I'm not a mess is on patrol.</string>
  <string id="6116616">Maker, where is Donnic? I have to... head this off before it goes to the viscount.</string>
  <string id="6116619">Maybe a formal apology. Something that shows the guards they can still trust me.</string>
  <string id="6116622">How would you know? He wasn't blind to you.</string>
  <string id="6116625">No, but you were.</string>
  <string id="6116628">What are you talking about? Are you...</string>
  <string id="6116631">You're their captain, not a golem. They expect you to have feelings.</string>
  <string id="6116632">They'll understand.</string>
  <string id="6116633">Not if they get in the way of the job.</string>
  <string id="6116636">You don't know that.</string>
  <string id="6116639">I won't be that stupid again.</string>
  <string id="6116642">Try the copper marigolds again. In hindsight, they weren't the worst option.</string>
  <string id="6116643">I suggest awkward gifts.</string>
  <string id="6116644">It's not funny!</string>
  <string id="6116647">I beg to differ.</string>
  <string id="6116650">You'll beg for more than that if you keep this up!</string>
  <string id="6116653">Coughs</string>
  <string id="6116656">My apologies, Serah Hawke, but I need a moment with the captain.</string>
  <string id="6116659">Guardsman Donnic?</string>
  <string id="6116662">Please.</string>
  <string id="6116671">Giggles</string>
  <string id="6116675">Guardsman Donnic... did not file a complaint.</string>
  <string id="6116678">You took it further than I intended. I can't seem to hold you back.</string>
  <string id="6116679">Better than I wanted.</string>
  <string id="6116680">You've finally mastered the obvious. I'll take your word on the second part.</string>
  <string id="6116681">It was certainly stupid.</string>
  <string id="6116683">I won't. I've sunk my teeth in, and I'm not letting go.</string>
  <string id="6116684">See, if I could say things like that, I wouldn't have needed you.</string>
  <string id="6116687">I heard. Keep it to yourself.</string>
  <string id="6116690">I just... there's no way I can ever repay you.</string>
  <string id="6116693">Perhaps it's simple. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6116704">Hey, can I ask you something?</string>
  <string id="6116707">You know me better than anyone. There was never anything there but... did you ever wonder about you and I?</string>
  <string id="6116708">That would be all kinds of wrong. You're... like a dangerous sister.</string>
  <string id="6116709">No, of course not. Never.</string>
  <string id="6116710">I am so glad, because there is just... you've always been a great friend.</string>
  <string id="6116713">Shout when you need me, Hawke. I'll always be here for you.</string>
  <string id="6116716">Just... knock first.</string>
  <string id="6116719">I suppose it would be similar to how Wardens think of Blights.</string>
  <string id="6116720">It'd be epic, but destructive.</string>
  <string id="6116721">You're off to a bad start.</string>
  <string id="6116724">It becomes their reason for living, but Maker, the carnage...</string>
  <string id="6116727">Then the world is lucky I couldn't ask for a better friend.</string>
  <string id="6116730">You. There's no way I can ever repay you. I just...</string>
  <string id="6116733">Kisses</string>
  <string id="6116736">Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6116739">I'm charming myself into obsolescence.</string>
  <string id="6116742">You'll get the chance. I was mute, and now I want to sing.</string>
  <string id="6116745">Please don't.</string>
  <string id="6116748">Any longer and the darkspawn would have had you.</string>
  <string id="6116749">I'm glad I found you in time.</string>
  <string id="6116750">Next time, leave the darkspawn-stomping to the people with the big swords. Sound good?</string>
  <string id="6116751">This is no place for you.</string>
  <string id="6116752">The stories weren't made up just to frighten children. These monsters are real.</string>
  <string id="6116753">You're an idiot.</string>
  <string id="6116754">Believe me, I know that now.</string>
  <string id="6116757">I knew Iwan was up to something. He got so evasive every time I asked about the blighted sword.</string>
  <string id="6116760">I still can't believe he betrayed us. Do you think he's alive?</string>
  <string id="6116761">I was a fool to think we could do this by ourselves.</string>
  <string id="6116764">Or maybe I should get a bigger sword...</string>
  <string id="6116767">All this talk about swords is making me blush!</string>
  <string id="6116782">The templars have become more active in their hunt for me. I won't be able to stay here long.</string>
  <string id="6116789">He wouldn't tell us about the sword, but I never imagined he'd leave us to rot!</string>
  <string id="6116794">Our entrance to the Gallows is in the sewers. Not too far from here.</string>
  <string id="6116797">Last time I was here, we picked this place clean. What's your brother looking for?</string>
  <string id="6116798">What sword?</string>
  <string id="6116800">There were no working golems when I was here.</string>
  <string id="6116801">Golems?</string>
  <string id="6116811">You the one looking for the Amaranthine traitors?</string>
  <string id="6116814">He kept it close. Said he was going to use one of the golems to get past the others and reach the treasure.</string>
  <string id="6116815">Why would you shy away from loving someone just because they're like you?</string>
  <string id="6116818">She is theirs! I can feel their hold on her!</string>
  <string id="6116821">Justice... answers to nobody!</string>
  <string id="6116824">I will have my vengeance!</string>
  <string id="6116827">Silence!</string>
  <string id="6116828">Every one of them will feel justice's burn.</string>
  <string id="6116834">They will die! I will have every last templar for these abuses!</string>
  <string id="6116844">The tavern is never empty, even at this time of day.</string>
  <string id="6116847">Uh. Here we go.</string>
  <string id="6116850">Oh, now this is strange.</string>
  <string id="6116853">I remember more drunks, last time we were here.</string>
  <string id="6116856">Where is everyone?</string>
  <string id="6116859">Nobody's here?</string>
  <string id="6116862">Looks like you were right about the trap.</string>
  <string id="6116865">This may be a trap after all, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6116868">Somehow, I don't think this reunion will go smoothly.</string>
  <string id="6116871">We don't know that yet. Let's see if Varania is here.</string>
  <string id="6116967">Speak to Anders at his clinic about what happened to him and Vengeance.</string>
  <string id="6116970">All we wanted was to have the same adventure you did down in the Deep Roads.</string>
  <string id="6116974">I... what?</string>
  <string id="6116977">The women? They're missing, and you can't find them.</string>
  <string id="6116980">Ah, right. I cannot lie, serah. I tire of searching.</string>
  <string id="6116984">Here's your reward. Keep looking, though.</string>
  <string id="6116985">No luck? Keep searching. Nobles aren't great at lying low.</string>
  <string id="6116986">You here about the Amaranthine traitors?</string>
  <string id="6116989">Who?</string>
  <string id="6116994">Indeed.</string>
  <string id="6116997">Some hare-brained nobles in Amaranthine were conspiring against the Warden-Commander.</string>
  <string id="6117000">A truly stellar idea, if you know anything about her.</string>
  <string id="6117003">A truly stellar idea, if you know anything about him.</string>
  <string id="6117006">We caught most of the conspirators. But a few fled by sea and came here. We're offering a bounty.</string>
  <string id="6117007">And the city guard is all right with me killing foreign nobles?</string>
  <string id="6117008">Is this legal?</string>
  <string id="6117009">We tried getting permission. Lots of bowing, lots of flowery phrases, and a great deal of nothing from the viscount.</string>
  <string id="6117012">I came here to do a job. So if the viscount gets his precious feelings hurt he can take it up with the Warden-Commander.</string>
  <string id="6117014">Is Amaranthine in trouble?</string>
  <string id="6117015">Sounds like the Warden-Commander could be deposed if she's not careful.</string>
  <string id="6117018">Sounds like the Warden-Commander could be deposed if he's not careful.</string>
  <string id="6117021">True, the Amaranthine nobles are still a trifle upset about the whole burning down of their city.</string>
  <string id="6117024">But the farmers and rural nobles think the Warden-Commander can do no wrong.</string>
  <string id="6117025">But with Vigil's Keep and all the trading costers, I think the Warden'll do just fine.</string>
  <string id="6117026">It doesn't help that the Warden is Orlesian, but the commander defeated the darkspawn hordes. A few petulant nobles are child's play.</string>
  <string id="6117027">But this is the Hero of Ferelden. Same one that defeated Loghain, an Archdemon, the Mother, and no doubt more. Who do you think will win?</string>
  <string id="6117028">I'll pass on this.</string>
  <string id="6117029">I'm not interested.</string>
  <string id="6117030">Suit yourself.</string>
  <string id="6117033">Tell me what I need to know.</string>
  <string id="6117034">I'm in.</string>
  <string id="6117035">Here's a list of names and descriptions. Any time you end one of the bastards, let me know and I'll reward you.</string>
  <string id="6117038">Better act fast, though. We're looking for them, too.</string>
  <string id="6117041">Speak to Anders at his clinic about his loss of control.</string>
  <string id="6117044">Man in the Closet</string>
  <string id="6117049">That's the last of them. You do good work.</string>
  <string id="6117052">Come, men, back to the Vigil. And away from this cesspool of a city.</string>
  <string id="6117055">We should search the rest of the city.</string>
  <string id="6117056">The Conspirators</string>
  <string id="6117057">Posted on behalf of the Silver Order of Vigil's Keep:&#13;
&#13;
Several conspirators against the rightful ruler of Amaranthine are hiding amongst the good citizens of Kirkwall. A sizeable coin reward is offered to any that can dispatch these traitors. To assist in this endeavor, contact Sergeant Joanna in Lowtown.</string>

&#13;
Several conspirators against the rightful ruler of Amaranthine are hiding amongst the good citizens of Kirkwall. A sizeable coin reward is offered to any that can dispatch these traitors. To assist in this endeavor, contact Sergeant Joanna in Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6117065">You're one of the Amaranthine conspirators. There's a bounty on your head.</string>
  <string id="6117068">Curse you!</string>
  <string id="6117089">Bounty hunter!</string>
  <string id="6117092">One of Joanna's louts!</string>
  <string id="6117107">The darkspawn smashed the chest. Fine! But did they have to piss on it, too? These are my best boots.</string>
  <string id="6117108">We're too late. The darkspawn smashed the chest.</string>
  <string id="6117109">Looks like the darkspawn got here first. That sword is in splinters now.</string>
  <string id="6117110">It looks like the darkspawn smashed the chest.</string>
  <string id="6117111">Is this it? But... who broke everything? Oh, right. Darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6117112">Too late. Darkspawn got here before us.</string>
  <string id="6117116">I'm no easy prey.</string>
  <string id="6117181">Barks</string>
  <string id="6117182">All right. Let's see.</string>
  <string id="6117183">Something in the wardrobe?</string>
  <string id="6117184">Come on, boy. Let's go into another room.</string>
  <string id="6117185">Come on, let's go.</string>
  <string id="6117186">If you can't get along with the wardrobe, I'll have to separate you.</string>
  <string id="6117187">Don't make me muzzle you.</string>
  <string id="6117188">Stop that racket! Go lay down!</string>
  <string id="6117189">Enough!</string>
  <string id="6117190">Whines</string>
  <string id="6117246">So Iwan is dead. That's what he gets for his treachery.</string>
  <string id="6117247">That's Iwan, isn't it? Poor bugger.</string>
  <string id="6117248">Stupid sodding boy.</string>
  <string id="6117249">Is this Iwan? All these dwarves look the same to me.</string>
  <string id="6117250">This is Iwan, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6117251">This must be Iwan. Poor boy.</string>
  <string id="6117252">And this must be Iwan.</string>
  <string id="6117259">Senseless. All of them. Out of their minds.</string>
  <string id="6117260">What point did that carnage serve?</string>
  <string id="6117261">Maker, there was no need for this.</string>
  <string id="6117262">I'm not one to turn down a fight, but what point did this serve?</string>
  <string id="6117263">A fight with no reason, unless you follow the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6117264">They threw their lives away. For the Qun?</string>
  <string id="6117265">What... was the point to this?</string>
  <string id="6117266">Bah! Throwing their lives away for nonsense.</string>
  <string id="6117270">She may not have known about this, but clearly Petrice set a trail right to us.</string>
  <string id="6117274">He was free. Void take their Qun, he was free!</string>
  <string id="6117275">But... the creature was free.</string>
  <string id="6117276">I... have no words. That poor creature.</string>
  <string id="6117277">What is wrong with these things?</string>
  <string id="6117278">I would choose death over servitude, but I do not follow the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6117279">The creature was free. There was no need for that.</string>
  <string id="6117280">That was not right. It wasn't, was it?</string>
  <string id="6117281">Daft thing. No sense in their heads.</string>
  <string id="6117284">Determined from the start. Petrice set a trail.</string>
  <string id="6117287">Free, and the creature still chose death.</string>
  <string id="6117291">There was no need for this carnage.</string>
  <string id="6117294">Petrice better have an answer for the trail that led the others here.</string>
  <string id="6117297">If this was her doing, I have a few questions for her.</string>
  <string id="6117298">Why arrange this, only to subvert it? I need answers.</string>
  <string id="6117299">It seems likely she set them on us, but why?</string>
  <string id="6117300">We did what she wanted. Why give us away?</string>
  <string id="6117301">If she set them on us, I would know why.</string>
  <string id="6117302">She sent us on an errand only to lead them to us? Why?</string>
  <string id="6117303">But, this was her idea. Why work against it?</string>
  <string id="6117304">Why mess up her own job? Of course, we haven't been paid yet...</string>
  <string id="6117306">Bloody darkspawn shit on everything they touch. There's nothing here.</string>
  <string id="6117404">The Red Iron said you might help me.</string>
  <string id="6117407">Athenril said you might help me.</string>
  <string id="6117413">Some raider captains are having secret meetings at night in Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6117417">He's dead. There's nothing a healer can do now.</string>
  <string id="6117418">I'm sorry, Merrill. It's too late.</string>
  <string id="6117419">I think he's beyond even the Keeper's skill now.</string>
  <string id="6117426">Please don't open the door!</string>
  <string id="6117429">Barks</string>
  <string id="6117432">You've caught a burglar. Good boy!</string>
  <string id="6117444">The job's simple: break up the meeting and kill every one of the bastards.</string>
  <string id="6117445">That's not much to go on.</string>
  <string id="6117446">Anything else?</string>
  <string id="6117447">It's enough to do the job.</string>
  <string id="6117448">Just tell me where they are.</string>
  <string id="6117449">I'll take care of them.</string>
  <string id="6117450">All the details are in this letter.</string>
  <string id="6117453">If you manage to eavesdrop on the meeting before you kill them, there'll be extra in it for you.</string>
  <string id="6117456">I'll be here.</string>
  <string id="6117459">I have a lot going on right now. Perhaps later.</string>
  <string id="6117460">Some other time.</string>
  <string id="6117461">Come back when you're done.</string>
  <string id="6117462">Those raider captains still need killing.</string>
  <string id="6117463">Understood.</string>
  <string id="6117469">My legs are cramping! Please just let me go.</string>
  <string id="6117472">You're not helping.</string>
  <string id="6117475">Good.</string>
  <string id="6117478">Be gone. And don't do it again.</string>
  <string id="6117479">Go, then.</string>
  <string id="6117486">Intruders!</string>
  <string id="6117487">You hear that?</string>
  <string id="6117491">I lost two of my men for damned wheat!</string>
  <string id="6117494">If it flies Amaranthine colors, you sink her.</string>
  <string id="6117497">Careful, lickspittle. My men and I aren't accustomed to taking orders.</string>
  <string id="6117500">The viscount's pardon comes with strings. If Amaranthine is left unchecked, they will rule the Waking Sea.</string>
  <string id="6117503">Piss on that. What do I care?</string>
  <string id="6117506">A dozen war galleys hunting your kind to extinction says you'll care.</string>
  <string id="6117509">Messere, someone's nearby!</string>
  <string id="6117514">He's got friends!</string>
  <string id="6117518">Someone powerful in Kirkwall wants the raiders to attack Amaranthine ships.</string>
  <string id="6117519">The raiders are dead.</string>
  <string id="6117522">As I suspected. You've earned a bonus.</string>
  <string id="6117527">You've done Ferelden and Amaranthine a great service.</string>
  <string id="6117537">Ogre</string>
  <string id="6117591">Alessa</string>
  <string id="6117612">I thought I could trust you!</string>
  <string id="6117613">You should see the look on your face.</string>
  <string id="6117614">Surprise!</string>
  <string id="6117615">Take her to Castillon. Or kill her. I don't care.</string>
  <string id="6117616">Do what you want with her.</string>
  <string id="6117617">Kill... me? What?</string>
  <string id="6117620">Chuckles I've dreamed about snapping that pretty neck.</string>
  <string id="6117623">H-Hawke... this wasn't the plan!</string>
  <string id="6117624">I hope you understand. We all do what we have to.</string>
  <string id="6117625">Sorry.</string>
  <string id="6117626">That wasn't what we—</string>
  <string id="6117627">I don't remember any plan.</string>
  <string id="6117628">What plan?</string>
  <string id="6117629">Do it. I'm tired of her squealing.</string>
  <string id="6117630">What are you waiting for?</string>
  <string id="6117631">No. No, wait—</string>
  <string id="6117634">Grunts</string>
  <string id="6117638">Chuckles I'd love to finish the job, but Castillon would never forgive me.</string>
  <string id="6117643">Do you now?</string>
  <string id="6117649">Hawke! This is—</string>
  <string id="6117658">It really is you.</string>
  <string id="6117661">Varania?</string>
  <string id="6117664">I... I remember you. We played in our master's courtyard while Mother worked. You called me...</string>
  <string id="6117667">Leto. That's your name.</string>
  <string id="6117670">What's wrong? Why are you so...?</string>
  <string id="6117671">It's a trap!</string>
  <string id="6117672">Draw your weapon!</string>
  <string id="6117673">Fenris, we have to get out of here!</string>
  <string id="6117674">We need to run!</string>
  <string id="6117675">I'll give you three guesses.</string>
  <string id="6117676">Oh, wonderful.</string>
  <string id="6117677">I'm sorry it came to this, Leto.</string>
  <string id="6117680">Ah, my little Fenris. Predictable as always.</string>
  <string id="6117681">Thank you, Champion, for sparing my miserable life. From here on, I swear—</string>
  <string id="6117682">If I let you go, others would take me for an easy mark.</string>
  <string id="6117683">I don't think so, thief.</string>
  <string id="6117684">I'll give you to the count of five before I sic my mabari on you.</string>
  <string id="6117685">I can be sporting.</string>
  <string id="6117689">Why don't we work something out? If you're good, I'll tell Castillon to go easy on you.</string>
  <string id="6117693">May the Dread Wolf never hear your footsteps, child.</string>
  <string id="6117696">Ma serannas, child. Your debt is paid in full.</string>
  <string id="6117699">It isn't too late to change your mind, da'len.</string>
  <string id="6117702">Dareth shiral, Keeper.</string>
  <string id="6117705">I'm ready. Let's depart.</string>
  <string id="6117708">Whines</string>
  <string id="6117713">Right, then. Bye!</string>
  <string id="6117726">I guess we have no choice but to go back to Anso and tell him.</string>
  <string id="6117729">Snorts Contrary to popular belief, I do have standards.</string>
  <string id="6117732">You're going to do whatever I want. I own you.</string>
  <string id="6117742">You sure about that?</string>
  <string id="6117759">Oh! I didn't hear. You must be the one the Keeper told me about. Aneth ara.</string>
  <string id="6117762">Did you hear that strange noise?</string>
  <string id="6117763">What was that?</string>
  <string id="6117764">Oh... I didn't hear anything.</string>
  <string id="6117765">This should be fun.</string>
  <string id="6117766">What...? No!</string>
  <string id="6117770">What? Surely you wouldn't...</string>
  <string id="6117773">One...</string>
  <string id="6117776">But...</string>
  <string id="6117779">Two... </string>
  <string id="6117782">Yells</string>
  <string id="6117785">Three-four-five! Make sure our guest leaves quickly.</string>
  <string id="6117788">Happy bark!</string>
  <string id="6117791">It's the dungeons for you. Go fetch a watchman, boy.</string>
  <string id="6117792">You're going to jail.</string>
  <string id="6117793">Barks</string>
  <string id="6117796">Going to fetch the Watch. Dogs aren't that smart... right?</string>
  <string id="6117799">Smarter than you, anyway.</string>
  <string id="6117804">Yells</string>
  <string id="6117810">Might get a little crowded in there. I'll wait here.</string>
  <string id="6117811">I'll wait outside the room. Good luck.</string>
  <string id="6117812">I think you and Isabela can handle it from here.</string>
  <string id="6117813">I'll be out here. Yell if you need me.</string>
  <string id="6117814">Velasco might get suspicious if I follow you in.</string>
  <string id="6117818">I hope Isabela leaves an obvious trail.</string>
  <string id="6117821">Wait, what am I talking about? Isabela's never subtle.</string>
  <string id="6117822">They just dragged Isabela out of here. We should follow.</string>
  <string id="6117823">To the rescue, then?</string>
  <string id="6117824">Let's find Isabela's trail and get her back before something nasty happens.</string>
  <string id="6117825">No time to waste. Let's pick up Isabela's trail.</string>
  <string id="6117905">This belongs to Isabela.</string>
  <string id="6117906">This is Isabela's trail.</string>
  <string id="6117907">Looks like the trail Isabela left.</string>
  <string id="6117911">The trail leads to Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6117915">Isabela's leading me to the Docks.</string>
  <string id="6117916">Ah, Isabela. Always full of surprises.</string>
  <string id="6117917">This was unexpected.</string>
  <string id="6117918">Laughs You're not still using that as an excuse, are you? Oh, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6117921">Does this have something to do with those markings?</string>
  <string id="6117922">But you're no ordinary slave.</string>
  <string id="6117923">Yes. I imagine I must look strange to you.</string>
  <string id="6117926">I did not receive these markings by choice. Even so, they have served me well. Without them I would still be a slave.</string>
  <string id="6117927">You didn't need to lie to get my help.</string>
  <string id="6117928">You could have asked.</string>
  <string id="6117929">That remains to be seen.</string>
  <string id="6117932">No. There's more.</string>
  <string id="6117935">It sounds like you intend to do more than just talk.</string>
  <string id="6117936">Confront him?</string>
  <string id="6117937">Danarius wants to strip the flesh from my bones and has sent so many hunters that I have lost count.</string>
  <string id="6117940">And before that, he kept me on a leash like a Qunari mage, a personal pet to mock Qunari custom.</string>
  <string id="6117943">So, yes, I intend to do more than just talk.</string>
  <string id="6117944">If it means fighting more slavers, I'll help you.</string>
  <string id="6117947">Let's do this.</string>
  <string id="6117950">Very well. I'll help you.</string>
  <string id="6117953">Looks like it's going to be a long night.</string>
  <string id="6117956">We're done here.</string>
  <string id="6117959">I'm not going to help you kill someone.</string>
  <string id="6117962">I think I'm already too involved.</string>
  <string id="6117965">Please. I... am not used to asking for help, but I am asking now.</string>
  <string id="6117968">Danarius will never stop hunting me. This is my only chance. I cannot do it without you.</string>
  <string id="6117969">This is going to cost you.</string>
  <string id="6117970">You owe me.</string>
  <string id="6117971">You lured me into a trap, and now you want my help?</string>
  <string id="6117972">You tricked me!</string>
  <string id="6117973">If Anso had told you to divert an ambush of Tevinter bounty hunters, would you have done it?</string>
  <string id="6117974">I would have charged more.</string>
  <string id="6117975">If the pay was right.</string>
  <string id="6117976">My funds are limited, but I will find a way to repay you if you help me now. I swear it.</string>
  <string id="6117977">It should have been my decision.</string>
  <string id="6117978">That's not the point.</string>
  <string id="6117979">Good point.</string>
  <string id="6117980">Probably not.</string>
  <string id="6117981">Had I known of you earlier, I might have asked you personally. I had only Anso to rely on, I fear.</string>
  <string id="6117984">I am not lying to you now. Please help me do this.</string>
  <string id="6117986">It never ends.</string>
  <string id="6117989">I escaped a land of dark magic only to have it hunt me at every turn. It is a plague burned into my flesh and my soul.</string>
  <string id="6117992">And now I find myself in the company of yet another mage.</string>
  <string id="6118002">And now I find myself in the company of even more mages.</string>
  <string id="6118005">Are... you talking about me?</string>
  <string id="6118009">Find out.</string>
  <string id="6118010">I'll let you figure that out for yourself.</string>
  <string id="6118013">I don't know. What do you think I seek?</string>
  <string id="6118016">You want me to tell you and spoil all the fun?</string>
  <string id="6118019">You are skilled—I know that much.</string>
  <string id="6118022">You have an issue with mages?</string>
  <string id="6118023">Is this a problem?</string>
  <string id="6118024">I have an issue with magic and those who are careless with it.</string>
  <string id="6118027">Fame and fortune, like anyone.</string>
  <string id="6118028">Power.</string>
  <string id="6118029">I see.</string>
  <string id="6118032">I'm just trying to get by.</string>
  <string id="6118033">Survival.</string>
  <string id="6118034">Yet I have seen many crimes done in the name of survival.</string>
  <string id="6118037">I'm not seeking anything.</string>
  <string id="6118038">Nothing.</string>
  <string id="6118039">Yet danger will undoubtedly find you.</string>
  <string id="6118045">If you have a problem with my brother, you have a problem with me.</string>
  <string id="6118048">If you have a problem with my sister, you have a problem with me.</string>
  <string id="6118051">Not all mages are alike, or I'd be the first to act.</string>
  <string id="6118054">We're not all the same, nor are we worthy of your scorn.</string>
  <string id="6118057">Hawke isn't the only mage around here.</string>
  <string id="6118060">Well, thank you for the vote of confidence.</string>
  <string id="6118063">We all know the danger.</string>
  <string id="6118066">No pressure or anything.</string>
  <string id="6118070">That's not your concern.</string>
  <string id="6118071">I didn't ask for your opinion.</string>
  <string id="6118074">My friends are my business, aren't they?</string>
  <string id="6118077">And this affects you how, exactly?</string>
  <string id="6118080">My sister is stronger than you think.</string>
  <string id="6118081">Bethany has proven herself.</string>
  <string id="6118082">You tell him, Brother.</string>
  <string id="6118085">You tell him, Sis.</string>
  <string id="6118088">Some of us may surprise you, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6118091">Merrill's quite capable of handling herself.</string>
  <string id="6118092">Merrill has earned her place.</string>
  <string id="6118093">I am? I mean— yes, of course I am!</string>
  <string id="6118096">And she isn't the only one.</string>
  <string id="6118099">You're talking about a Grey Warden and a healer.</string>
  <string id="6118100">Anders has proven himself.</string>
  <string id="6118101">And a few other things. But let's not mention those.</string>
  <string id="6118104">I'm not blind. I know magic has its uses, and there are undoubtedly mages with good intentions.</string>
  <string id="6118107">But even the best-intentioned mage can fall prey to temptation, and then their power is a curse to inflict upon others.</string>
  <string id="6118110">No one's stopping you from moving on, you know.</string>
  <string id="6118113">Is that how you feel? It's terrible what those mages did to you.</string>
  <string id="6118116">Considering all the curses inflicted on us, I'd say it's an even trade.</string>
  <string id="6118119">I imagine I appear ungrateful. If so, I apologize, for nothing could be further from the truth.</string>
  <string id="6118122">I did not find Danarius, but I still owe you a debt. Here is all the coin I have, as Anso promised.</string>
  <string id="6118125">Should you find yourself in need of assistance, I would gladly render it.</string>
  <string id="6118126">He doesn't want me at all, just the markings on my skin.</string>
  <string id="6118129">Not so far.</string>
  <string id="6118132">The truth is I know nothing of the ritual that placed these markings on me. It was Danarius's choice, one he now regrets.</string>
  <string id="6118135">You didn't seem all that thrilled with me a moment ago.</string>
  <string id="6118136">You would help a mage?</string>
  <string id="6118137">You are not Danarius. Whether you are anything like him remains to be seen.</string>
  <string id="6118138">Are you going to have a problem with my companions?</string>
  <string id="6118139">Will you work with mages?</string>
  <string id="6118140">You should know some of my companions are mages.</string>
  <string id="6118141">Will you work with mages?</string>
  <string id="6118145">I will watch them carefully if we travel together. I can promise no more.</string>
  <string id="6118152">The viscount's son was taken?</string>
  <string id="6118153">Sounds like you have a job opportunity. Is it open to anyone?</string>
  <string id="6118156">Looks like I'm not the only one who saw the bounty posting.</string>
  <string id="6118159">Apparently so, and I am regretting it.</string>
  <string id="6118162">As I told the others, Viscount Dumar's son, Saemus, is missing. We suspect he was taken by a Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6118165">If you would like to try your hand at securing his safe return, feel free.</string>
  <string id="6118168">I have certainly granted no exclusivity to the Winters and their violent approach.</string>
  <string id="6118169">Sounds like you have a problem that needs fixing.</string>
  <string id="6118170">You're hiring mercenaries?</string>
  <string id="6118171">If this is about a rescue, that woman did not seem the type.</string>
  <string id="6118172">What was her problem?</string>
  <string id="6118179">You led him here.</string>
  <string id="6118182">Now, now, Fenris. Don't blame your sister. She did what any good Imperial citizen should.</string>
  <string id="6118185">I never wanted these filthy markings, Danarius! But I won't let you kill me to get them.</string>
  <string id="6118188">Laughs Oh, how little you know, my pet.</string>
  <string id="6118191">And this is your new master, then? The Champion of Kirkwall? Impressive.</string>
  <string id="6118192">And this is your new mistress, then? The Champion of Kirkwall? Quite lovely.</string>
  <string id="6118193">Fenris doesn't belong to anyone.</string>
  <string id="6118194">He's no one's slave.</string>
  <string id="6118195">Do I detect a note of jealousy? It's not surprising. The lad is rather skilled, isn't he?</string>
  <string id="6118199">Time to die.</string>
  <string id="6118200">I'm going to wipe that smirk off your face.</string>
  <string id="6118201">I've heard enough of you.</string>
  <string id="6118202">Charmed, I'm sure.</string>
  <string id="6118203">I'm sure we can come to some kind of arrangement.</string>
  <string id="6118204">We can negotiate.</string>
  <string id="6118205">No! He needs to die!</string>
  <string id="6118208">You weren't always this way, Fenris. Once upon a time you had affection for me. I remember it fondly.</string>
  <string id="6118211">Shut your mouth, Danarius!</string>
  <string id="6118214">Sighs The word is master.</string>
  <string id="6118217">If you want him, he's yours.</string>
  <string id="6118218">Take him.</string>
  <string id="6118219">What?</string>
  <string id="6118222">I thought I was the only one thinking that.</string>
  <string id="6118225">I hope you're joking.</string>
  <string id="6118228">Hand him back to a slaver? I...</string>
  <string id="6118231">No! Tell me you won't do this!</string>
  <string id="6118234">I knew a mage would be sensible. I will, of course, make it worth your while.</string>
  <string id="6118237">Interesting. I'll make it worth your while, of course. The power of the Imperium will be at your disposal.</string>
  <string id="6118240">Don't do this, Hawke. I know we are not friends, but I can't face him without you.</string>
  <string id="6118242">Very well.</string>
  <string id="6118243">Enough! I can't take the drama!</string>
  <string id="6118244">You're on your own, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6118245">Not a chance.</string>
  <string id="6118246">I suppose I should not be surprised.</string>
  <string id="6118252">Unbelievable.</string>
  <string id="6118258">This is wrong!</string>
  <string id="6118261">What shall it be, Fenris? Will you throw your life away?</string>
  <string id="6118264">No. I will go with you.</string>
  <string id="6118267">Lovely! Here's a token of my appreciation, Champion. I'm sure I can arrange to have something more... appropriate sent along soon.</string>
  <string id="6118270">Come alone, everyone! The boat leaves for Minrathous within the hour!</string>
  <string id="6118273">I have several, thanks to the... base types who responded to our call.</string>
  <string id="6118285">She is the type I feared we would attract.</string>
  <string id="6118288">This is more of a mess than you're letting on. No thanks.</string>
  <string id="6118289">I have enough trouble.</string>
  <string id="6118291">I will bring Saemus back.</string>
  <string id="6118292">I should know about the competition.</string>
  <string id="6118293">Tell me about the Winters.</string>
  <string id="6118294">There must be suspicions about why the boy went missing.</string>
  <string id="6118295">Why was Saemus taken?</string>
  <string id="6118296">This isn't a task for a guardsman?</string>
  <string id="6118297">Why not send the city guard?</string>
  <string id="6118298">There is a concern of appearance.</string>
  <string id="6118304">In these times, public embarrassment is preferable to official embarrassment.</string>
  <string id="6118305">The Qunari are not wild in the city. Petition their leader for the boy's return.</string>
  <string id="6118306">Appeal to the Arishok.</string>
  <string id="6118307">The Arishok has declared that it is not his role to do so.</string>
  <string id="6118310">Apparently their rebels, the Tal-Vashoth, are hunted anyway—killed for what they are, not for what they may have done.</string>
  <string id="6118313">That does not bode well for Saemus.</string>
  <string id="6118314">Why? What have you heard?</string>
  <string id="6118317">Nothing. Until now.</string>
  <string id="6118320">The Winters, out of Nevarra. They don't care one whit if Saemus is returned unharmed.</string>
  <string id="6118323">Their lead, Serah Ginnis, is hungry for a foothold in fair Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6118326">And frankly, we have enough of their kind.</string>
  <string id="6118327">There is truly nothing known. He is gone, and there have been sightings of a Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6118330">The only complication is that Saemus is known to be... of a sympathetic mind.</string>
  <string id="6118333">He may have placed himself in danger, but it is danger nonetheless.</string>
  <string id="6118336">If we used guards, it would allow Viscount Dumar's opponents to say this admits the Qunari threat, because the city responded.</string>
  <string id="6118339">I'll drag the boy back here soon enough.</string>
  <string id="6118342">The boy will be home soon enough.</string>
  <string id="6118345">Ready the reward, he'll be back in no time.</string>
  <string id="6118348">Declare it if you like, but the reward goes to whomever brings him back safe.</string>
  <string id="6118351">A discussion you are welcome to have with the Winters, should you encounter them. On the Wounded Coast.</string>
  <string id="6118352">Your refusal causes less grief than the acceptance of the Winters. I expect no end of trouble on the Wounded Coast.</string>
  <string id="6118355">And Saemus, poor lad, will be in the middle of it.</string>
  <string id="6118356">It's a stamen.</string>
  <string id="6118357">I don't see anything wrong.</string>
  <string id="6118358">Oh, a stamen! How silly of me to think it was that other thing.</string>
  <string id="6118361">Rivaini women would wear these so that their wombs would be fruitful and their marriages blessed with many children.</string>
  <string id="6118364">Or when they wished for... love.</string>
  <string id="6118365">I've made you uncomfortable. I apologize.</string>
  <string id="6118366">It was an inappropriate gift.</string>
  <string id="6118367">No... don't apologize. You didn't know what it meant. And I appreciate the thought. I really do.</string>
  <string id="6118370">Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6118371">Who needs love? I was just hoping for plain old lust.</string>
  <string id="6118372">I'm not looking for love.</string>
  <string id="6118373">Chuckles Lust? Lust I can manage.</string>
  <string id="6118377">Don't read too much into it.</string>
  <string id="6118378">I didn't mean for that.</string>
  <string id="6118379">Oh, I'm not going to.</string>
  <string id="6118382">Not that they worked, of course. Chuckles Seems to me you either have a fruitful womb, or you don't.</string>
  <string id="6118385">Thank you. It's nice to have something to remind me of my homeland.</string>
  <string id="6118388">Have you seen my wife, Ninette?</string>
  <string id="6118389">I offer a bounty for the return of my wife!</string>
  <string id="6118390">You! You there! You look capable! Can you help me?</string>
  <string id="6118391">I need to find my wife! Will no one help me?</string>
  <string id="6118396">What do you mean you can't help me?</string>
  <string id="6118399">This is a domestic matter, serah. If your wife has chosen to leave you, there's nothing we can do.</string>
  <string id="6118402">Ninette is my wife! She's legally bound to me. Bring her back!</string>
  <string id="6118405">We're done here.</string>
  <string id="6118406">Consider this payback.</string>
  <string id="6118411">Call the men back. We've got an appointment with the viscount.</string>
  <string id="6118414">Isn't that right, Saemus?</string>
  <string id="6118417">That one of their words? See, that's why you need to be dragged home. You're playing too nice with those things.</string>
  <string id="6118420">I'll wager you've gone even further than that. Haven't you, brat?</string>
  <string id="6118423">Useless! Why are we still paying those sluggards?</string>
  <string id="6118424">Ninette keeps the company of other men and makes no secret of it.</string>
  <string id="6118427">I'd be better off with her gone.</string>
  <string id="6118430">Sighs Well, as long as her family knows I had nothing to do with it. They'd ruin me otherwise.</string>
  <string id="6118431">You don't care that Ninette might be hurt or dead. You sicken me.</string>
  <string id="6118432">You're a terrible husband.</string>
  <string id="6118433">You've never lived with her!</string>
  <string id="6118436">I can't imagine why she'd leave you. You're such a prize.</string>
  <string id="6118437">And you wonder why she's gone.</string>
  <string id="6118438">Marriage is more trouble than it's worth.</string>
  <string id="6118439">Bah, marriage.</string>
  <string id="6118440">It wasn't always like this. We were in love once. She defied her parents to marry me.</string>
  <string id="6118443">Sometimes I wonder if I dreamed those years.</string>
  <string id="6118459">I met him soon after their ship foundered. I had run, again, to escape the Keep and my father.</string>
  <string id="6118462">Ashaad was to map the coast to find an answer for the Arishok.</string>
  <string id="6118465">Perhaps it isn't the right word.</string>
  <string id="6118468">I am the viscount's son, bound by everything that means. Ashaad did not care.</string>
  <string id="6118469">We were both seeking something. That was enough.</string>
  <string id="6118470">The viscount sends thugs to do a father's job. I was in no danger until his help arrived.</string>
  <string id="6118471">You could have told him this was your wish.</string>
  <string id="6118476">And now Ashaad is dead. It's not right.</string>
  <string id="6118477">Should his people be told?</string>
  <string id="6118482">There was much of Ashaad that I didn't understand, but it was so very worth trying.</string>
  <string id="6118483">Er, allow me to present one Serah Hawke, Your Excellency. She fulfilled the bounty.</string>
  <string id="6118484">Er, allow me to present one Serah Hawke, Excellency. He fulfilled the bounty.</string>
  <string id="6118487">It was my understanding you were captured alone, foolishly traipsing about the coast as you do.</string>
  <string id="6118490">I was not captured, I was with Ashaad. The Qunari. They are not monsters to be feared.</string>
  <string id="6118493">If you would just try to understand, others would see as well.</string>
  <string id="6118496">Better that you were thought abducted than to have their influence suspected in my own family... benign or not, it's too much.</string>
  <string id="6118498">Yes, your son went too far.</string>
  <string id="6118500">Saemus is right to question.</string>
  <string id="6118501">It’s not my place to take sides in this.</string>
  <string id="6118504">Forgive me, this is a private concern of yours.</string>
  <string id="6118507">A little too much insight into the office for me. </string>
  <string id="6118510">You're too closed minded. You've raised a smart child and should listen to him.</string>
  <string id="6118513">I respectfully disagree, Excellency. Your son is showing considerable wisdom.</string>
  <string id="6118516">Well, that's just foolish. Listen to your boy, he's making sense.</string>
  <string id="6118519">The boy could do with having some respect knocked into his head.</string>
  <string id="6118522">I agree, Excellency. Saemus, you should show greater respect to this office.</string>
  <string id="6118525">I have to agree, Excellency. The boy's a bit of a brat.</string>
  <string id="6118528">That is... quite enough! My apologies, Excellency, for this intrusion into personal matters! There is no... just... move!</string>
  <string id="6118544">Groans</string>
  <string id="6118547">You are no longer my master.</string>
  <string id="6118559">I had no choice, Leto.</string>
  <string id="6118562">Stop calling me that.</string>
  <string id="6118565">He was going to make me his apprentice. I would have been a magister.</string>
  <string id="6118568">You sold out your own brother to become a magister?</string>
  <string id="6118571">You have no idea what we went through. What I've had to do since Mother died. This was my only chance.</string>
  <string id="6118574">And now you have no chance at all.</string>
  <string id="6118577">Please... don't do this. Please tell him to stop!</string>
  <string id="6118578">Wait! Don't kill her.</string>
  <string id="6118579">Fenris, stop.</string>
  <string id="6118580">Why not? She was ready to see me killed.</string>
  <string id="6118583">What is she to me other than just one more tool of the magisters?</string>
  <string id="6118585">She's your sister.</string>
  <string id="6118586">I know what it's like to kill your own sister.</string>
  <string id="6118589">I killed my brother. I know what I'm talking about.</string>
  <string id="6118592">This is your family, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6118595">If this is what you really want, then do it.</string>
  <string id="6118596">Go ahead, then.</string>
  <string id="6118597">Yes. If this is what you really want.</string>
  <string id="6118600">Your sister's as much a victim as you were.</string>
  <string id="6118601">She's not responsible.</string>
  <string id="6118605">Get out.</string>
  <string id="6118611">You said you didn't ask for this, but that's not true.</string>
  <string id="6118614">You wanted it. You competed for it. When you won you used the boon to have Mother and I freed.</string>
  <string id="6118617">Why are you telling me this?</string>
  <string id="6118620">Freedom was no boon. I look on you now and I think you received the better end of the bargain.</string>
  <string id="6118624">You deserve to die.</string>
  <string id="6118625">You have this coming.</string>
  <string id="6118628">After what you've done?</string>
  <string id="6118631">Stop what? Stop killing a traitor?</string>
  <string id="6118635">It's not my place.</string>
  <string id="6118636">Fenris does as he likes.</string>
  <string id="6118639">This can't be stopped now.</string>
  <string id="6118642">Hey, I'm a neutral party here.</string>
  <string id="6118645">I would have given you everything.</string>
  <string id="6118648">Gasps</string>
  <string id="6118657">I thought discovering my past would bring a sense of belonging, but I was wrong.</string>
  <string id="6118660">Magic has tainted that, too. There is nothing for me to reclaim.</string>
  <string id="6118663">I am alone.</string>
  <string id="6118664">I'm here, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6118665">You have me.</string>
  <string id="6118669">You have friends.</string>
  <string id="6118670">You're not alone.</string>
  <string id="6118671">Oh? And who would those be? You?</string>
  <string id="6118674">Yes. A mage as my only friend.</string>
  <string id="6118677">Are we really so terrible?</string>
  <string id="6118680">Is that what we are?</string>
  <string id="6118683">It sure isn't me.</string>
  <string id="6118686">You do have friends, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6118689">Hey now, you could do worse.</string>
  <string id="6118692">We're all alone, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6118693">Get used to it.</string>
  <string id="6118694">That's easy for you to say.</string>
  <string id="6118697">Danarius is dead, Fenris. You're finally free.</string>
  <string id="6118698">Put the past behind you.</string>
  <string id="6118699">I don't feel free.</string>
  <string id="6118702">You heard what Varania said. I wanted these. I fought for them.</string>
  <string id="6118705">I feel unclean, like this magic is not only etched into my skin, but has also stained my soul.</string>
  <string id="6118708">And now this.</string>
  <string id="6118711">Let's go. I need to get out of here.</string>
  <string id="6118717">Varania must be around here somewhere.</string>
  <string id="6118721">I don't want to talk about this. Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6118723">Just tell me if you hear more rumblings from the Coterie about protection. Blondie's got enough trouble...</string>
  <string id="6118726">Thanks. I'm in real danger of forgetting that.</string>
  <string id="6118729">It came all the way from Orzammar. And has been worn by several generations of miserly rat bastards.</string>
  <string id="6118732">Just what I always wanted. Now I can sign trade negotiations with blinding efficiency!</string>
  <string id="6118735">I guess I should be dealing with that pile of letters from my Orzammar agent.</string>
  <string id="6118738">Poor sod's been kept out of the city for six months. If Harrowmont isn't killed soon, he'll be writing me novels.</string>
  <string id="6118739">Well, now I guess I can't weasel out of writing to my contact in Bhelen's court. Fun times!</string>
  <string id="6118742">Fifty pages of spying on the Assembly, all about golems and war and crazy smiths. My head hurts just thinking about it.</string>
  <string id="6118743">The great thing about Bhelen dissolving the Assembly: so much less bureaucracy. The bad thing: it's still Orzammar.</string>
  <string id="6118750">It's just the way the wind is blowing. I'll keep an ear to the ground and let you know if it turns ugly.</string>
  <string id="6118753">I'll expect that favor returned some day.</string>
  <string id="6118754">You owe me.</string>
  <string id="6118755">Keep that shard away from people. We don't want half of Kirkwall going mad.</string>
  <string id="6118756">Just be careful.</string>
  <string id="6118757">I appreciate that, Varric. Just no murderous rampages, all right?</string>
  <string id="6118758">Try not to go crazy.</string>
  <string id="6118759">I'm sure you can handle it.</string>
  <string id="6118760">I know.</string>
  <string id="6118761">Back in Bartrand's house you seemed... not quite yourself.</string>
  <string id="6118762">You sure you're all right?</string>
  <string id="6118763">Me nervous? Nah. Cursed insanity-causing shards of evil make me feel warm and fuzzy.</string>
  <string id="6118764">I'm not worried!</string>
  <string id="6118771">Look, I just want to say, it has been an honor knowing you.</string>
  <string id="6118772">You wouldn't say something like that unless you wanted something.</string>
  <string id="6118773">Get on with it.</string>
  <string id="6118774">You're a good friend, Varric.</string>
  <string id="6118775">I feel the same.</string>
  <string id="6118776">Are you about to die? Am I? Why so serious all of a sudden?</string>
  <string id="6118777">Something's wrong!</string>
  <string id="6118784">Thanks, Hawke. I promise I'll think of you whenever I argue pointlessly with some blighter.</string>
  <string id="6118787">If you think that was bad, I should tell you about the Blackmarsh.</string>
  <string id="6118791">Normally, you'd be right. This time, it's sincere. Try not to choke or anything in surprise.</string>
  <string id="6118792">I know. It's hard to imagine what you'd do without me.</string>
  <string id="6118793">Don't panic. I just needed to get that off my chest.</string>
  <string id="6118805">You know it's six years today? Six years since I found you dragging your tail out of Bartrand's office.</string>
  <string id="6118808">Here's to whatever comes next!</string>
  <string id="6118811">Hey, brontos have loads of charm! Of the rock-licking, dull variety, but it's still charm.</string>
  <string id="6118812">You know what I admire most about you, Hawke? Your eloquence. It's inspiring.</string>
  <string id="6118813">I've been called worse.</string>
  <string id="6118820">Well, that sounds ominous. But don't sweat, Hawke. I pay my debts.</string>
  <string id="6118821">I don't plan on waving it around in the street. Don't worry.</string>
  <string id="6118822">Don't worry. I've been cutting back on those lately.</string>
  <string id="6118823">See? Nothing to worry about!</string>
  <string id="6118826">See, when you say things like that, Blondie, it just makes me glad I didn't know you sooner.</string>
  <string id="6118829">Who goes to a place named Blackmarsh on purpose? Now, if they called it Beermarsh... no, still doesn't work.</string>
  <string id="6118832">You've got a point. The marsh part does cancel out anything else. Flowermarsh? Kittenmarsh? Nope. No good.</string>
  <string id="6118835">Ah, you've got company. I'll see you later.</string>
  <string id="6118838">Hawke! What can I do for you?</string>
  <string id="6118847">I knew you'd understand.</string>
  <string id="6118850">I think getting out of that house cleared my head. I feel fine now.</string>
  <string id="6118855">What was Anders here for?</string>
  <string id="6118856">Why was Anders here?</string>
  <string id="6118942">Blondie didn't tell you? He comes down here now and then. He loses at cards to Isabela, and I buy him drinks.</string>
  <string id="6118945">This is the best tavern in Kirkwall, Hawke! As a favor to you, I put Blondie on my tab.</string>
  <string id="6118948">Only place in Kirkwall he can get a decent drink. Blondie comes by here, and I put him on my tab.</string>
  <string id="6118951">He's got some stories about his days in Ferelden that sound implausible even to me.</string>
  <string id="6118954">He's not bad for a mage. Crazy, but that's most everyone in this city.</string>
  <string id="6118955">Any news in the city I should know about?</string>
  <string id="6118956">Heard anything important?</string>
  <string id="6118957">I'm not here on business. Just dropping by.</string>
  <string id="6118958">I just came to visit.</string>
  <string id="6118959">I wouldn't say no to a pint.</string>
  <string id="6118960">Why don't you buy me a drink?</string>
  <string id="6118967">And this is still the rankest pit in Thedas. Never changes.</string>
  <string id="6118970">After what happened here, I can't imagine anyone's eager to move into the viscount's palace.</string>
  <string id="6118973">The grand cleric reminds me of my mother. A really tall version of Mother. With a nicer hat.</string>
  <string id="6118980">All the most interesting things in Kirkwall happen in Hightown after dark. True story.</string>
  <string id="6118983">If you want to see something funny, flirt with Edwina. Go on, I dare you.</string>
  <string id="6118986">Did I pay my tab this month? Ah, I'll sort it out later.</string>
  <string id="6118989">I got used to this place being filled with oxmen. It's strange not seeing them around.</string>
  <string id="6118992">What is that smell? I think someone's murdered an elf in the alley. Watch your step.</string>
  <string id="6118995">Great, this reminds me that I have five shipping manifests to look over when I get home.</string>
  <string id="6118998">I don't care what people say, the sound of waves is not soothing.</string>
  <string id="6118999">Nothing you don't know already: The viscount's departure. A vacuum of power. Trouble's brewing.</string>
  <string id="6119002">Drinking is business, Champion. You know that.</string>
  <string id="6119005">I should make you buy the drinks, O Champion of Kirkwall!</string>
  <string id="6119008">Sighs Get rid of one threat and another appears. I'm starting to think this city is in love with crisis.</string>
  <string id="6119011">Hope you're ready for it, my friend. I'm keeping Bianca close.</string>
  <string id="6119012">Of course, you also seem to thrive on turmoil. Lucky for you.</string>
  <string id="6119017">There is no middle ground? It sounds like you've both been hardheaded.</string>
  <string id="6119018">You're both stubborn fools.</string>
  <string id="6119019">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6119020">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6119096">You're here. I wasn't sure you would come.</string>
  <string id="6119099">Justice does not approve of my obsession with you. He believes you're a distraction.</string>
  <string id="6119105">It is one of the few things on which he and I disagree.</string>
  <string id="6119113">I've been trying to write down my arguments. To convince someone like you that the Circle is abusive and unjust.</string>
  <string id="6119116">You're a mage!</string>
  <string id="6119119">Your own sister is one of us!</string>
  <string id="6119122">Your own sister was one of us!</string>
  <string id="6119125">You are an intelligent woman.</string>
  <string id="6119128">You're not a stupid man.</string>
  <string id="6119131">How can you not see? Mages' gifts are granted by the Maker. How is it any man can call himself a templar and set himself above us?</string>
  <string id="6119135">So, what arguments have you come up with?</string>
  <string id="6119136">What are you writing?</string>
  <string id="6119137">Andraste suffered at the hands of magisters, thus she feared the influence of magic.</string>
  <string id="6119140">But if the Maker blamed magic for the magisters' actions in the Black City, why would He still gift us with it?</string>
  <string id="6119143">The oppression of mages stems from the fears of men, not the will of the Maker. What do you think?</string>
  <string id="6119147">You make a strong case.</string>
  <string id="6119148">It's a good argument.</string>
  <string id="6119165">What's so wrong with the way things are?</string>
  <string id="6119166">Why is the Circle so bad?</string>
  <string id="6119167">Would you willingly enter a place where they say your very existence is a sign of the Maker's hatred?</string>
  <string id="6119170">You saw Ser Alrik's plan! How many other templars want mages to be their mindless slaves?</string>
  <string id="6119173">You saw what they did to Karl! Every mage lives in fear of the Tranquil brand.</string>
  <string id="6119176">For all they warn about demons, the most common way for a Circle mage to die is by his own hand.</string>
  <string id="6119177">Have you ever thought what it's like to be a templar?</string>
  <string id="6119178">You need to see both sides.</string>
  <string id="6119179">We all know their case. Magic is dangerous. We've both seen mages succumb.</string>
  <string id="6119182">But while we're treated like children, we'll never take responsibility for our actions. We must be empowered to police ourselves!</string>
  <string id="6119185">I'm pretty sure there's some training involved.</string>
  <string id="6119186">It's not just any man.</string>
  <string id="6119187">Any fool with a sword can sign on to the templars. They rule by violence, not divine right.</string>
  <string id="6119190">You know how I feel. It's pointless to say more.</string>
  <string id="6119191">I'm not arguing with you.</string>
  <string id="6119192">You defy the Circle yourself, yet condemn the rest of your kind to it!</string>
  <string id="6119195">I will make you see! I swear, if I convince no one else in Thedas, I'll at least have you by my side before this is done.</string>
  <string id="6119196">I refuse to let you embrace a mad cause that will get you hanged.</string>
  <string id="6119197">I won't let you hurt yourself.</string>
  <string id="6119198">I hate your politics. Doesn't mean we don't have other things in common.</string>
  <string id="6119199">Let's agree to disagree.</string>
  <string id="6119200">I swear, I don't know whether to kiss you or kill you. You're everything I hate.</string>
  <string id="6119203">A mage, who turns on her own kind to serve the templars.</string>
  <string id="6119206">A mage, who turns against his own people to curry favor with the templars.</string>
  <string id="6119209">You let your own sister be dragged off to the Circle, even after you saw what they did to Karl.</string>
  <string id="6119212">You condemn mages as weak-willed, then make a deal with the first demon who offers.</string>
  <string id="6119215">You sent that boy Feynriel to be imprisoned in the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6119218">You turned those apostates from Starkhaven over to that mad templar.</string>
  <string id="6119221">But I can't stop thinking about you. For three years, you've haunted my sleep. I wake aching for you.</string>
  <string id="6119224">It is madness. This can only end in ruin.</string>
  <string id="6119228">You've been warning me for years. You haven't hurt me yet.</string>
  <string id="6119229">We can make it work.</string>
  <string id="6119230">I'm willing to risk it.</string>
  <string id="6119231">Do that again.</string>
  <string id="6119235">But I can't stop thinking about you. For years I've told myself there's nothing there, but I can feel it smoldering between us.</string>
  <string id="6119237">Let's do something about it.</string>
  <string id="6119241">I've been wondering when you'd notice.</string>
  <string id="6119242">I feel it too.</string>
  <string id="6119246">Be careful. You've seen what's inside me. I'm not always a gentle man.</string>
  <string id="6119252">If your door is open tonight, I will come to you. If not, I'll know you took my warning at last.</string>
  <string id="6119257">There is nothing between us. Do you understand?</string>
  <string id="6119258">Never say that again.</string>
  <string id="6119259">Perfectly.</string>
  <string id="6119262">But don't expect this to be the last you hear from me about the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6119265">Don't talk like you own me. There's nothing between us.</string>
  <string id="6119266">You will never convince me.</string>
  <string id="6119267">Fine! But don't expect me to bow my head because you're feeling inflexible.</string>
  <string id="6119270">The fight between mages and templars is larger than you and me.</string>
  <string id="6119271">The Chantry made its laws a thousand years ago, based on fear of an empire that has long since crumbled.</string>
  <string id="6119274">But its hold is too strong to change in increments. There must be a revolution.</string>
  <string id="6119275">You want to overthrow the Chantry?</string>
  <string id="6119276">Revolution?</string>
  <string id="6119280">The Chantry does many good things. But it cannot remain a part of our society if it won't accept mages.</string>
  <string id="6119283">If it can't acknowledge that its templars are beyond its control, it must be torn down.</string>
  <string id="6119284">Who's telling me this, Justice or you?</string>
  <string id="6119285">Is this Justice talking?</string>
  <string id="6119286">Who would you listen to?</string>
  <string id="6119289">Justice is no malevolent influence, as you seem to think. He is the embodiment of righteousness.</string>
  <string id="6119292">If he disapproves of something, it is wrong.</string>
  <string id="6119293">What I saw in the Gallows hardly seemed righteous!</string>
  <string id="6119294">He tried to kill that girl!</string>
  <string id="6119295">Your spirit of righteousness murdered an innocent girl.</string>
  <string id="6119296">He killed that girl!</string>
  <string id="6119297">You said yourself: he's turned into a creature of mindless vengeance.</string>
  <string id="6119298">You told me he's changed.</string>
  <string id="6119299">I hear your warning, Hawke. But I would not turn my back on this cause, Justice or no.</string>
  <string id="6119305">I'll do my best to see that the fewest innocents are hurt in the process.</string>
  <string id="6119306">At least you're flexible.</string>
  <string id="6119307">Glad you're open-minded.</string>
  <string id="6119308">You're impossible.</string>
  <string id="6119309">I give up.</string>
  <string id="6119310">Change is coming. Neither you nor anyone can stop that.</string>
  <string id="6119313">You don't think small.</string>
  <string id="6119314">That's ambitious.</string>
  <string id="6119315">I've been blessed with powers and opportunities beyond normal men.</string>
  <string id="6119318">If I don't use them for good, I might as well have spent my life mucking cattle barns.</string>
  <string id="6119319">You've lost your mind if you think you can single-handedly destroy the Chantry.</string>
  <string id="6119320">You're mad.</string>
  <string id="6119321">It will not be single-handed.</string>
  <string id="6119324">Sooner or later, everyone in Kirkwall will have to choose a side.</string>
  <string id="6119333">What are you doing?</string>
  <string id="6119339">Putting out milk. I miss having a cat around. But I think the refugees have scared them all off. Or maybe eaten them.</string>
  <string id="6119378">You know, I've been meaning to thank you.</string>
  <string id="6119381">Having someone like you making a name for yourself in Kirkwall, it's done a lot for mages.</string>
  <string id="6119384">You're the kind of leader we need. To tell the world we won't be punished any longer for our Maker-given gifts.</string>
  <string id="6119385">I don't care about the politics. I just don't want to see the templars lock you up.</string>
  <string id="6119386">I'm doing it for you.</string>
  <string id="6119387">I will not stand by while the templars hunt and murder our people.</string>
  <string id="6119388">It's the right thing to do.</string>
  <string id="6119389">Oh, I love when you go all hot-headed revolutionary.</string>
  <string id="6119390">You're cute when you rebel.</string>
  <string id="6119391">When you get like this, I think it'd be hard for anyone to turn you down.</string>
  <string id="6119392">I like you like this.</string>
  <string id="6119396">I'm not interested in leading your revolution.</string>
  <string id="6119397">Keep me out of it.</string>
  <string id="6119398">Mages in this city look up to you. They want what you have.</string>
  <string id="6119404">Just knowing you exist is enough to light the fire.</string>
  <string id="6119405">You don't need to stick your neck out for the mages here, but you have.</string>
  <string id="6119408">One day, we'll make a world where your sister can be free again.</string>
  <string id="6119409">You let those apostates from Starkhaven start over. Maybe they can be an example for the world.</string>
  <string id="6119410">Maybe because of you, Feynriel will master his magic and return to teach us how the Tevinters do it.</string>
  <string id="6119411">It takes courage to step into the line of fire.</string>
  <string id="6119412">It would kill me to see the templars lock you up.</string>
  <string id="6119413">I'm doing it for you.</string>
  <string id="6119414">Mages cannot be treated as guilty just by association.</string>
  <string id="6119415">It's the right thing to do.</string>
  <string id="6119416">I can't tell you how reassuring that is. Sometimes, you're the only reason I don't think I'm crazy.</string>
  <string id="6119419">I've always had a thing for scrappy underdogs.</string>
  <string id="6119420">I root for the little guy.</string>
  <string id="6119421">Don't tease me. You made it clear we're just friends. And that's enough for me.</string>
  <string id="6119424">I've tried to hold back.</string>
  <string id="6119427">You saw what I did to that girl.</string>
  <string id="6119430">You saw what I almost did to that girl.</string>
  <string id="6119433">You've seen what I am.</string>
  <string id="6119436">But I'm still a man. Don't expect me to resist forever.</string>
  <string id="6119439">Whatever you think is going on between us, it's not.</string>
  <string id="6119440">Get a hold of yourself!</string>
  <string id="6119441">I'm sorry. I misunderstood. It won't happen again.</string>
  <string id="6119445">But I'm still a man. You can't tease me like this and expect me to resist forever.</string>
  <string id="6119446">I don't want you to resist.</string>
  <string id="6119447">Kiss me.</string>
  <string id="6119448">How long will it take before I drive you mad?</string>
  <string id="6119449">I like to tease you.</string>
  <string id="6119450">Pants</string>
  <string id="6119453">If we could die tomorrow, I didn't want it to be without doing that.</string>
  <string id="6119454">So, that's it? Now you're ready to die?</string>
  <string id="6119455">Is that all?</string>
  <string id="6119456">This will be a disaster. But I can't live without it.</string>
  <string id="6119459">We could die tomorrow. I don't want it to be before I tell you how I feel.</string>
  <string id="6119460">I've never felt this way about anyone.</string>
  <string id="6119461">I love you.</string>
  <string id="6119462">Ooh. Is it in verse? I hope it's in verse.</string>
  <string id="6119463">Tell me.</string>
  <string id="6119464">Don't tell me. Show me.</string>
  <string id="6119465">Forget talking.</string>
  <string id="6119466">I thought with Justice... this part of me was over.</string>
  <string id="6119469">I can't give you a normal life. If you're with me, we'll be hunted, hated. The whole world will be against us.</string>
  <string id="6119482">Don't thank me. It wasn't about you.</string>
  <string id="6119483">I'm not doing it for you.</string>
  <string id="6119484">I know. That's what makes it matter. You follow your convictions.</string>
  <string id="6119487">When you still believed in me after what I did to that poor girl...</string>
  <string id="6119490">When you still believed in me after I almost killed that poor girl...</string>
  <string id="6119493">When you told me that I did the right thing, with Justice...</string>
  <string id="6119496">I knew you meant it. You wouldn't say it just to make me feel better.</string>
  <string id="6119499">You make me think I can really do this, lead a revolution.</string>
  <string id="6119500">I didn't realize you were planning anything that big.</string>
  <string id="6119501">A revolution?</string>
  <string id="6119502">No small change would address the injustice that mages face.</string>
  <string id="6119505">The Chantry itself must be overturned.</string>
  <string id="6119508">There will always be mages born in Thedas. But templars are made by men... and they can be unmade.</string>
  <string id="6119509">Why does this matter so much to you?</string>
  <string id="6119510">Was the Circle that bad?</string>
  <string id="6119511">Why do you think your parents gave up everything to keep you and your sister out of the Circle?</string>
  <string id="6119514">You saw Ser Alrik's plan! How many templars would prefer that every mage was a mindless, drooling babe?</string>
  <string id="6119517">You saw what they did to Karl.</string>
  <string id="6119520">In the Circle, they tell you day and night that magic is sin. A mark on your soul of the Maker's hatred.</string>
  <string id="6119523">But for all the talk of demons, the most common death I saw for a mage was suicide.</string>
  <string id="6119524">Together, we'll win this fight.</string>
  <string id="6119525">I'll be with you.</string>
  <string id="6119526">Your faith inspires me.</string>
  <string id="6119529">Sometimes, I fear I cannot do this. Not while I struggle against this vengeance inside me.</string>
  <string id="6119532">Why do none of my friends ever just want to be the best wallop player in Lowtown?</string>
  <string id="6119533">You don't have small goals.</string>
  <string id="6119534">Laughs Would the great Hawke deign to associate with the best wallop player in Lowtown?</string>
  <string id="6119537">Seriously, though, I couldn't do this without your support. I couldn't... hold onto this spirit of vengeance inside me.</string>
  <string id="6119540">If you want to be an example to mages, you need to master yourself.</string>
  <string id="6119541">You need more self-control.</string>
  <string id="6119542">After what happened, I will never forget that.</string>
  <string id="6119545">Every day, I feel the need for vengeance growing inside me.</string>
  <string id="6119548">But I know you won't let me lose myself to him.</string>
  <string id="6119554">Yes! Oh, I've been waiting for someone to say that.</string>
  <string id="6119563">I can't believe I'm doing this, but... I need your help.</string>
  <string id="6119566">The eluvian won't work. Which I'm sure is news that fills your heart with joy.</string>
  <string id="6119572">Lethallin, I need to ask you for a favor.</string>
  <string id="6119575">Lethallan, I need to ask something of you.</string>
  <string id="6119578">I thought the arulin'holm would be the last thing I needed, but the eluvian still won't work.</string>
  <string id="6119581">I think... I think I have to go back to the... spirit that helped me at the start of all this.</string>
  <string id="6119582">You want me to help you summon a demon.</string>
  <string id="6119583">You mean the demon.</string>
  <string id="6119584">No, no! I'd never ask you to do that!</string>
  <string id="6119587">Why do you think this demon will help?</string>
  <string id="6119588">Why is this necessary?</string>
  <string id="6119589">He knows about the mirror. I don't know how much. He wouldn't tell me everything, and it's dangerous to trust...</string>
  <string id="6119592">Nothing bad ever comes from summoning demons!</string>
  <string id="6119593">What a good idea.</string>
  <string id="6119594">That's why... why I need you to come with me.</string>
  <string id="6119597">I've called to the spirit, but he doesn't seem to hear. He was sealed in an artifact on Sundermount. I have to look for him there.</string>
  <string id="6119600">But... if things go wrong... if he possesses me, I need you to strike me down.</string>
  <string id="6119601">You can't ask me to do that.</string>
  <string id="6119602">I could never do that.</string>
  <string id="6119603">Ma vhenan... please. I know it's a lot to ask.</string>
  <string id="6119606">What if you overpower me? What then?</string>
  <string id="6119607">And if I fail?</string>
  <string id="6119608">You've faced down Qunari and varterrals and ogres! You can do this.</string>
  <string id="6119611">You would risk becoming an abomination for this mirror? How is it worth that?</string>
  <string id="6119612">Think about this.</string>
  <string id="6119613">Ma vhenan, you of all people should understand. I would gladly sacrifice my life to help my people.</string>
  <string id="6119616">If it brings back this artifact of the elvhen, if it gives us even one piece of our history, it's worth any risk.</string>
  <string id="6119619">You want to summon a demon that may possess you, then have me kill you? How is that a plan?</string>
  <string id="6119620">Are you insane?</string>
  <string id="6119621">Please understand, ma vhenan, I owe it to my people to finish this.</string>
  <string id="6119624">You haven't left me any other choice!</string>
  <string id="6119627">Please do this for me.</string>
  <string id="6119630">There's no one else I trust.</string>
  <string id="6119636">If you care for me, help me.</string>
  <string id="6119637">You wanted to save me, didn't you? So save me from hurting anyone else.</string>
  <string id="6119638">You kept the arulin'holm from me so that no one would get hurt. So come with me now. Safeguard everyone.</string>
  <string id="6119642">Please, ma vhenan, I don't want to go into this alone.</string>
  <string id="6119643">Lethallin, please... come with me. I don't want... anything bad to happen.</string>
  <string id="6119644">I need you, lethallan. I'd never forgive myself if someone else got hurt because of me.</string>
  <string id="6119645">If you're determined to do this, then I'll come with you to make sure nothing goes wrong.</string>
  <string id="6119646">I'll do it.</string>
  <string id="6119647">Ma serannas! You've no idea what a relief that is!</string>
  <string id="6119650">The demon is sealed in a cave on Sundermount. The sooner we get this over with, the better.</string>
  <string id="6119651">Go to Marethari. Maybe there's an alternative to summoning the demon.</string>
  <string id="6119652">Talk to the Keeper first.</string>
  <string id="6119653">The Keeper would never help me! Why do you think I had to find the demon in the first place?</string>
  <string id="6119656">Talk to her if you wish. I've never had any luck with it.</string>
  <string id="6119657">The whole clan has moved on by now, anyway. You'll never find her.</string>
  <string id="6119658">I can't do it, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6119659">Absolutely not.</string>
  <string id="6119660">I hope you'll change your mind. If you won't help me, I'll have to do this alone.</string>
  <string id="6119663">Who bound this demon here and why?</string>
  <string id="6119664">What was the demon here for?</string>
  <string id="6119679">If you hadn't come, I'd be out looking for you.</string>
  <string id="6119680">I'm glad you're here.</string>
  <string id="6119681">So, he's kind of... an unwilling participant in our threesome?</string>
  <string id="6119682">He's still in there... right?</string>
  <string id="6119683">Maybe we should wait until the voices in your head are in agreement.</string>
  <string id="6119684">I'm not ready for this.</string>
  <string id="6119685">I understand.</string>
  <string id="6119688">I have seen you with Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6119691">Be careful. As innocent as she seems, she is still a blood mage.</string>
  <string id="6119694">She is just less honest about there being a third party in your bed.</string>
  <string id="6119695">I have seen you with Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6119698">Whatever you see in a maniac like that... perhaps at least your hand will tame him.</string>
  <string id="6119699">I have seen you whispering with Isabela.</string>
  <string id="6119702">If a quick tumble is all you're looking for, you can't go wrong there.</string>
  <string id="6119705">I thought perhaps you wanted something deeper.</string>
  <string id="6119706">It's better this way. You deserve a man who can promise you his whole soul.</string>
  <string id="6119709">But I will never stop thinking about you.</string>
  <string id="6119710">You are ashamed to lie with an apostate.</string>
  <string id="6119713">I will not bring it up again.</string>
  <string id="6119716">What was all that about?</string>
  <string id="6119717">What's going on?</string>
  <string id="6119718">My wife Ninette is missing. There's a reward for anyone who finds her.</string>
  <string id="6119730">Escape while you can. The Wounded Coast is overrun!</string>
  <string id="6119734">Please don't call it that.</string>
  <string id="6119748">When I was in the Circle, love was only a game. It gave the templars too much power if there was something you couldn't stand to lose.</string>
  <string id="6119753">The spiders have never strayed so far from their lairs before. It should be safe here.</string>
  <string id="6119754">They came upon my hunting party without warning. The rest are dead.</string>
  <string id="6119755">I hope those strangers that camped inland are still alive.</string>
  <string id="6119756">I appreciate what you've done. But I'm leaving. Now!</string>
  <string id="6119759">Screams</string>
  <string id="6119763">The Goddess demands sacrifice. Loose the hounds!</string>
  <string id="6119769">Oh, great Sophia, someone has killed the faithful!</string>
  <string id="6119772">This one knows. You. You have slain many of my pets.</string>
  <string id="6119781">Lowtown</string>
  <string id="6119782">Lowtown</string>
  <string id="6119786">Lowtown</string>
  <string id="6119804">It would kill me to lose you.</string>
  <string id="6119819">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6119823">No matter. There are more... with their tiny minds.</string>
  <string id="6119826">So many toys to play with, but you are too strong to bend.</string>
  <string id="6119827">Release whatever hold you have on these people.</string>
  <string id="6119828">Stop controlling them.</string>
  <string id="6119829">Don't you know? You're too old to be playing with toys.</string>
  <string id="6119830">You need to stop.</string>
  <string id="6119831">The Chant says, Suffer not an abomination to live.</string>
  <string id="6119832">You're going to die.</string>
  <string id="6119833">This one will feast upon your entrails and make a goblet of your skull.</string>
  <string id="6119838">Slave Guard</string>
  <string id="6119842">Master Slaver</string>
  <string id="6119844">Are you sure you want me here?</string>
  <string id="6119847">I thought you and Merrill... But perhaps you finally saw the demon's face behind that virginal smile.</string>
  <string id="6119848">I thought you and Fenris... Or did the beast finally turn on you?</string>
  <string id="6119849">Did you decide you wish something more than a quick tumble with Isabela?</string>
  <string id="6119861">He shouldn't have been able to leave! What happened to him?</string>
  <string id="6119871">I told her to go. You're the one I want to be with.</string>
  <string id="6119872">I left her.</string>
  <string id="6119873">We can't do this, Anders. I already gave my heart to Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6119874">I love her.</string>
  <string id="6119875">Fenris is gone. There's nothing more between us.</string>
  <string id="6119876">He left me.</string>
  <string id="6119877">I'm sorry he hurt you. But I can't be sorry if he led you to me.</string>
  <string id="6119880">Don't call him that! I'm sorry, Anders, we can't do this.</string>
  <string id="6119881">I love him.</string>
  <string id="6119882">Fine!</string>
  <string id="6119886">I'm only interested in you.</string>
  <string id="6119887">She meant nothing to me. You're the one I love.</string>
  <string id="6119890">He meant nothing to me. You're the one I care about.</string>
  <string id="6119893">She didn't want to tie herself down.</string>
  <string id="6119894">She left me.</string>
  <string id="6119895">I'm sorry if she hurt you. But I can't be sorry she's gone.</string>
  <string id="6119898">It never happened.</string>
  <string id="6119899">There was nothing between us.</string>
  <string id="6119900">I can't do this, Anders. I know what she is, but... I still love her.</string>
  <string id="6119901">I love her.</string>
  <string id="6119902">She will break your heart. I can see the appeal for a night or two, but there is no room in that woman for love.</string>
  <string id="6119910">Bah. Talking about it makes my head hurt. Good luck to you, serah.</string>
  <string id="6119915">They even send her flowers! To our home! And you wonder why I hate her?</string>
  <string id="6119926">I love you.</string>
  <string id="6119933">I've been holding back from saying that. You should have a normal life, not be tied down to a fugitive with no future.</string>
  <string id="6119936">But I don't ever want to leave you.</string>
  <string id="6119947">It would have taken powerful magic to break him free of this prison. </string>
  <string id="6119957">I happened.</string>
  <string id="6119961">Terror on the Coast</string>
  <string id="6119964">He thinks he'll get rich quick off this expedition.</string>
  <string id="6119967">He talked that fool Emrys and poor Merin into going.</string>
  <string id="6119971">I'm no one's nursemaid.  Let your boys get out of this themselves.</string>
  <string id="6119972">I don't care about your sons.</string>
  <string id="6119973">Something is causing the giant spiders along the Wounded Coast to become unusually aggressive. Search the area and uncover the source of the disturbance.</string>
  <string id="6119974">Kill the abomination Sophia Dryden.</string>
  <string id="6119975">Sophia Dryden was killed. The Wounded Coast is safer for the time being.</string>
  <string id="6119978">Keeper, what have you done?</string>
  <string id="6119981">The demon's plan was always for you to complete the mirror.</string>
  <string id="6119984">It would have been a doorway out of this prison and into our world. You would have been his first victim.</string>
  <string id="6120003">Ooh, I like him. He reminds me of someone.</string>
  <string id="6120008">I couldn't let that happen, da'len.</string>
  <string id="6120009">What did you do, destroy the demon?</string>
  <string id="6120010">So you banished the demon.</string>
  <string id="6120011">The demon hasn't been destroyed. Not yet. It's still here.</string>
  <string id="6120012">You stopped it. You saved Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6120013">Merrill is safe, then.</string>
  <string id="6120014">Not yet. The demon is still here.</string>
  <string id="6120015">You didn't think to mention that the demon was gone before we hiked all the way up here?</string>
  <string id="6120016">You could have said something.</string>
  <string id="6120017">It's not gone.</string>
  <string id="6120018">Well, she certainly cast a spell on me! Laughs</string>
  <string id="6120025">I couldn't fight it in the Fade while it was trapped. And I couldn't banish it without making it stronger.</string>
  <string id="6120031">Iwan called it the Heartdrinker. He says it's the masterwork of an ancient smith from this thaig.</string>
  <string id="6120034">He bought a book from one of the Orzammar caravans. It had the location of the sword.</string>
  <string id="6120037">Or at least to the golems who guard it.</string>
  <string id="6120038">This sounds familiar.</string>
  <string id="6120039">This sounds familiar.</string>
  <string id="6120042">Please, come tell my father as soon as you have news.</string>
  <string id="6120045">I need to find someone who'll help...</string>
  <string id="6120050">This is our territory. We don't want no templars!</string>
  <string id="6120053">Get back! I don't want to hurt you!</string>
  <string id="6120056">All he told me was he'd bought a control rod that was supposed to activate the guardians.</string>
  <string id="6120059">Maybe, but greed is hardly exclusive to dwarves.</string>
  <string id="6120064">Keeper!</string>
  <string id="6120067">What have you done? I don't want this. I never wanted this! Creators, please let this be a bad dream...</string>
  <string id="6120070">So I made myself its prison. Kill me, and it dies too. Merrill will finally be safe.</string>
  <string id="6120073">No! You can't ask... I won't do this!</string>
  <string id="6120076">You always knew your blood magic had a price, da'len. I have chosen to pay it for you.</string>
  <string id="6120079">Dareth shiral.</string>
  <string id="6120090">I'll wake up and feel like an idiot, and she'll scold me for not listening...</string>
  <string id="6120092">She was stupid.</string>
  <string id="6120098">I thank you, serah, for coming along when you did. I am Emeric.</string>
  <string id="6120101">Hunter</string>
  <string id="6120105">Sophia Dryden</string>
  <string id="6120109">You want the sword, you need the rod. What do you say? Everything I paid, plus ten percent for pain and suffering?</string>
  <string id="6120110">She brought this on herself. If she'd trusted you, she'd be alive.</string>
  <string id="6120111">You were trying to help your people. She should have had more faith.</string>
  <string id="6120112">Getting possessed never helps anything.</string>
  <string id="6120113">She didn't want this to happen to you.</string>
  <string id="6120114">She loved you, Merrill. She wanted to protect you.</string>
  <string id="6120115">I don't think anybody wanted this. Not even the demon. Marethari did what she had to.</string>
  <string id="6120122">Use the rod on the first golem. It should get you past the others.</string>
  <string id="6120125">And that must be the golem control rod. Perhaps the creatures it controls are further down this path.</string>
  <string id="6120128">Doesn't look like he got a chance to use the control rod. Maybe the golems are further in.</string>
  <string id="6120131">Looks like the golem control rod's still intact, though. Shall we go find something to use it on?</string>
  <string id="6120134">Nice rod, though! You suppose there's some big hard men up ahead to use it on?</string>
  <string id="6120137">He's still holding the golem control rod. He must never have reached his treasure.</string>
  <string id="6120140">And is that the control rod? I guess he never reached the guardians.</string>
  <string id="6120143">And his control rod. Let's find some golems.</string>
  <string id="6120148">Try the rod. Maybe it will do something.</string>
  <string id="6120149">It seems fairly unimpressive now. Try using the rod on it.</string>
  <string id="6120150">That little rod controls such a great creature? Do you suppose it resents that?</string>
  <string id="6120151">Ooh, is it time to use the rod?</string>
  <string id="6120152">Is this a golem? What is the rod supposed to do to it?</string>
  <string id="6120153">Use the control rod carefully—it will bring this creature to life.</string>
  <string id="6120154">He's hiding something! Tell us the truth. What happened to my poor Merin?</string>
  <string id="6120157">No! You bastard!</string>
  <string id="6120357">If there was a price to pay, I should have paid it! She had no right to interfere!</string>
  <string id="6120359">I don't know what to think now.</string>
  <string id="6120360">If she hadn't been so stubborn... if she had listened to me! She never believed in me.</string>
  <string id="6120407">You took a terrible risk, and you don't get to choose who suffers because of it.</string>
  <string id="6120408">That's not up to you.</string>
  <string id="6120409">Would you rather have died?</string>
  <string id="6120410">This could have been you.</string>
  <string id="6120411">You wanted to rebuild a mirror that kills people using magic you learned from a demon.</string>
  <string id="6120412">Merrill, you were being crazy.</string>
  <string id="6120415">I... I should go to the clan. Someone needs to know, needs to come... take care of her.</string>
  <string id="6120416">Did you learn nothing?</string>
  <string id="6120417">Waste of time?</string>
  <string id="6120418">Most people just say she left her husband.</string>
  <string id="6120419">That sort of attitude will never pay off.</string>
  <string id="6120420">Don't be pessimistic.</string>
  <string id="6120421">Ha! I was eager at first, but failure has leeched all enthusiasm from me.</string>
  <string id="6120422">Why did you even bother?</string>
  <string id="6120423">Why were you investigating?</string>
  <string id="6120427">This all started when Mharen—one of our Circle mages—disappeared. I found it odd. She was a bit older and hardly adventurous. </string>
  <string id="6120449">Then I heard about Ninette and two other missing women.</string>
  <string id="6120452">I think the disappearances are connected, and I suspect foul play is involved.</string>
  <string id="6120454">Keep control, and remember who is on your side.</string>
  <string id="6120455">Just remember I'm an ally.</string>
  <string id="6120456">Growls</string>
  <string id="6120459">Of course. I expected no different.</string>
  <string id="6120462">I went to all this trouble and you still want to die?</string>
  <string id="6120463">Sounds like garbage to me.</string>
  <string id="6120464">Have you mentioned any of this to the city guard?</string>
  <string id="6120465">Have you gone to the guards?</string>
  <string id="6120473">They say there's no proof the disappearances are connected.</string>
  <string id="6120479">They think the women just left home, that it happens all the time.</string>
  <string id="6120486">Yes! I took this risk willingly! That was my choice! She didn't have to save me!</string>
  <string id="6120515">This battle showed that I'm no longer the warrior I used to be. I know when to walk away.</string>
  <string id="6120557">Mages routinely flee the Circle. Perhaps Mharen just wanted freedom?</string>
  <string id="6120558">Maybe Mharen escaped.</string>
  <string id="6120559">She had always been loyal.</string>
  <string id="6120562">She received lilies from an unknown suitor, and some of us thought she may have gone to meet him.</string>
  <string id="6120565">Perhaps her disappearance is linked.</string>
  <string id="6120593">I've got a nasty feeling about this place.</string>
  <string id="6120594">Ooh, shades. What do you think that means?</string>
  <string id="6120595">Something is going on here, and I don't like it.</string>
  <string id="6120596">Those things were summoned by dark magic.</string>
  <string id="6120597">Why does everything we do have to involve magic?</string>
  <string id="6120598">I think someone doesn't want us here.</string>
  <string id="6120599">Demons. Summoned by another mage, no doubt.</string>
  <string id="6120600">I hate magic.</string>
  <string id="6120603">Emeric will want to see this, and I should bring the ring to Ghyslain. It might belong to Ninette.</string>
  <string id="6120615">Chest</string>
  <string id="6120627">It should be enough to convince them the disappearances are worth investigating.</string>
  <string id="6120630">Excuse me, serah. I have arrangements to make.</string>
  <string id="6120743">Big changes are coming, huh? Captain of the guard.</string>
  <string id="6120746">Thank you, Wesley.</string>
  <string id="6120747">He's been gone a long time to call on him like that.</string>
  <string id="6120748">Dwelling on the dead husband?</string>
  <string id="6120749">A year is just a collection of minutes... seconds. But yes, it's been a long time.</string>
  <string id="6120752">That you keep his memory speaks well of him.</string>
  <string id="6120753">He's in your thoughts?</string>
  <string id="6120754">Not sure I like being behind the dead in order of influence.</string>
  <string id="6120755">Wesley? What about me?</string>
  <string id="6120756">Of course I have you to thank. It's just... I've made a mess of things, time to time. But that failure...</string>
  <string id="6120759">He's not with me. I know that. Wesley's at the Maker's side, or he's not. Either way, he knows no pain.</string>
  <string id="6120762">What I keep is that moment. I won't let anyone down like that again.</string>
  <string id="6120763">Wesley's at the Maker's side, or he's not? What do you mean by that?</string>
  <string id="6120764">You doubt he's with the Maker?</string>
  <string id="6120765">Wesley believed, and if he was correct, then that's where he is.</string>
  <string id="6120768">But... this business of the less the Maker does, the more He's proven? I don't find it compelling.</string>
  <string id="6120771">But you married a templar.</string>
  <string id="6120774">I married a man. A good one. And he's gone.</string>
  <string id="6120777">I have heard the Chant. It is lovely. Perhaps that's all it needs to be.</string>
  <string id="6120778">I don't see how you can take the blame for the darkspawn horde.</string>
  <string id="6120779">You think you let Wesley down?</string>
  <string id="6120780">I didn't cause his death, but I also didn't prevent it.</string>
  <string id="6120783">Do you blame me?</string>
  <string id="6120786">I did. I didn't want to. I know why it had to be done, and so did Wesley.</string>
  <string id="6120789">I put him to the sword myself, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6120792">If not you, me.</string>
  <string id="6120795">At his behest.</string>
  <string id="6120798">Well, there is that.</string>
  <string id="6120801">I know in my head that it was right. So did Wesley.</string>
  <string id="6120804">But in my heart, that cut was cruel.</string>
  <string id="6120805">You clearly miss Wesley, but that's not the issue?</string>
  <string id="6120806">But this isn't about him?</string>
  <string id="6120807">Of course I miss him, but he's not coming back. Pining like a child serves no one.</string>
  <string id="6120810">So I remember him, but I let him rest.</string>
  <string id="6120813">You're not so kind to yourself, though.</string>
  <string id="6120816">No.</string>
  <string id="6120817">You were a pain before. You'll be insufferable as captain.</string>
  <string id="6120818">You'll be trouble from now on.</string>
  <string id="6120819">I should hope so.</string>
  <string id="6120822">Already plotting?</string>
  <string id="6120825">I've seen how the job can go bad. Never again. Every one of these men can count on that.</string>
  <string id="6120826">I can't imagine the captain of the guard will like wandering in my shadow.</string>
  <string id="6120827">Will you leave to be captain?</string>
  <string id="6120831">Which means someone will need to keep a close eye on you.</string>
  <string id="6120834">Besides, I'll be making the patrol schedule, and I don't intend to lead from a desk.</string>
  <string id="6120835">I could get used to having the law on my side.</string>
  <string id="6120836">So the captain's in my pocket.</string>
  <string id="6120837">You'll behave yourself, is what you'll do. I just sent Jeven to prison over corruption. I won't go the same road.</string>
  <string id="6120840">You never let me have any fun.</string>
  <string id="6120843">I think that's best for everyone.</string>
  <string id="6120844">I look forward to working with you, Guard-Captain Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6120845">Good work. I'm proud of you.</string>
  <string id="6120846">Still strange, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6120849">Captain of the guard. </string>
  <string id="6120852">Thank you for helping me get here, Hawke. It's where I should be.</string>
  <string id="6120855">Seriously though, keep your title in your office.</string>
  <string id="6120856">Just don't spout laws at me.</string>
  <string id="6120857">Excuse me?</string>
  <string id="6120860">We don't want to ruin a good relationship.</string>
  <string id="6120863">Right.</string>
  <string id="6120866">I'm with you, Hawke. To a point.</string>
  <string id="6120869">The greedy bastard didn't want to hire anyone else if it meant he had to share the spoils.</string>
  <string id="6120874">They entered the Deep Roads using the same passage you did. Please find them. I will see you rewarded for your efforts.</string>
  <string id="6120875">That passage is filled with darkspawn. I hope they eat you!</string>
  <string id="6120894">Maybe there's still something to salvage in this mess.</string>
  <string id="6120896">What? How dare you?</string>
  <string id="6120899">It's true.</string>
  <string id="6120902">No, this was just for fun.</string>
  <string id="6120903">Of course not.</string>
  <string id="6120904">Good.</string>
  <string id="6120907">Wrong Way</string>
  <string id="6120908">My father disowned me because of you!</string>
  <string id="6120911">I'm taking my sodding sword back!</string>
  <string id="6120918">I couldn't just sit by knowing monsters live down here.</string>
  <string id="6120919">I still can't believe the Grey Wardens accepted me. They treated me as one of Orzammar's own.</string>
  <string id="6120920">People shouldn't assume that the end of the Blight means the end of darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6120921">Without you, I would have died here three years ago. I would never have become a Warden.</string>
  <string id="6120922">Speak with Mother about her argument with Gamlen.</string>
  <string id="6120923">Find Grandfather Amell's will. Go to Darktown and break into the cellars of the old family estate.</string>
  <string id="6120924">Retrieve the will from the family vault.</string>
  <string id="6120926">Confront Gamlen with his father's will.</string>
  <string id="6120930">The will was found. Gamlen gambled away all his inherited riches.</string>
  <string id="6120933">Champion! Well-met. I never expected to find you here a second time.</string>
  <string id="6120936">I'm a Warden now. I couldn't sit by, knowing darkspawn still swarmed beneath our feet.</string>
  <string id="6120939">Both of you, send word to the Wardens in case we don't make it.</string>
  <string id="6120942">Of course. Thank you again for your aid, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6120945">Fenris has left for good to deal with Hadriana and Danarius on his own.</string>
  <string id="6120946">Do I know you from somewhere?</string>
  <string id="6120947">Who are you again, Merin?</string>
  <string id="6120948">You saved me when my fool of a brother wanted to throw me to the darkspawn so he could steal that old sword.</string>
  <string id="6120951">I knew when I saw you fighting those darkspawn that this was what I had to dedicate my life to. There is no more worthy cause.</string>
  <string id="6120954">Are you?</string>
  <string id="6120957">If you argue enough, you kind of convince yourself.</string>
  <string id="6120972">I've given up everything to rebuild my people's past, and you just threw my sacrifice in the garbage.</string>
  <string id="6120976">I wish the children would care more about this tree. It'll be up to them to mind it one day.</string>
  <string id="6120980">Holding Caves</string>
  <string id="6120984">Get out of my house. I never want to see you again!</string>
  <string id="6120987">You say you mean well, but right now... I'd rather be alone.</string>
  <string id="6120990">All right, let's go break some necks for the greater good.</string>
  <string id="6120991">I'll take the job.</string>
  <string id="6120992">All right, Aveline. I'll play guard for you.</string>
  <string id="6120993">I'm with you.</string>
  <string id="6120996">Bad Poet</string>
  <string id="6121001">My children have been in servitude—servitude—for a year. They should be nobility!</string>
  <string id="6121004">If wishes were poppy, we'd all be dreaming.</string>
  <string id="6121005">This is the way things are, Mother. Gamlen can't change it now.</string>
  <string id="6121006">Let's not fight.</string>
  <string id="6121007">You mean, this is real? No wonder I can't wake up.</string>
  <string id="6121008">This isn't a dream?</string>
  <string id="6121009">And here I thought that Fereldan you ran off with was a mage, not a jester.</string>
  <string id="6121012">Why was nothing set aside for us, Uncle?</string>
  <string id="6121013">Mother's right.</string>
  <string id="6121014">Your mother was supposed to marry the Comte de Launcet, and instead she ran off with some Fereldan apostate.</string>
  <string id="6121017">You don't get to stay the favorite when you do that.</string>
  <string id="6121020">Where is Father's will? If I could just see for myself—</string>
  <string id="6121023">It's not here, all right! It was read, it went in the vault. No one needed to look at it again.</string>
  <string id="6121024">I know the Amells were nobility, Mother, but not much else. Why don't you ever talk about them?</string>
  <string id="6121025">Tell me about our family.</string>
  <string id="6121026">The Amells have been a noble family in Kirkwall since Garahel drove out the Fourth Blight. But we've always carried magic in our blood.</string>
  <string id="6121029">The Hero of Ferelden was one of ours, you know. One of my cousin Revka's children. The Circle took them all.</string>
  <string id="6121032">It's been a stain on our lineage. No family of good standing would ever marry into a line with magic.</string>
  <string id="6121035">When I chose your father... I was bringing more magic into our line, not less. I think that's what hurt my parents the most.</string>
  <string id="6121036">Did Grandfather mention Mother in his will at all?</string>
  <string id="6121037">What exactly did the will say?</string>
  <string id="6121038">Our father died when you were still in short pants, lad. You can hardly expect me to remember.</string>
  <string id="6121041">Our father died when you were still in pinafores, girl. You can hardly expect me to remember.</string>
  <string id="6121044">Sounds like a yes to me.</string>
  <string id="6121045">Oh, of course not. Why should you do something reasonable?</string>
  <string id="6121046">Please, Uncle. We have a right to see it for ourselves.</string>
  <string id="6121047">Let her just look at it.</string>
  <string id="6121048">Maybe so.</string>
  <string id="6121051">That touched a nerve. What's in there that you don't want us to see?</string>
  <string id="6121052">Why so defensive?</string>
  <string id="6121053">Nothing!</string>
  <string id="6121056">But you won't be seeing the bloody thing. It's still locked up on the estate. And that's long out of my hands.</string>
  <string id="6121059">Take me to the vault.</string>
  <string id="6121060">I'm going to look.</string>
  <string id="6121061">Can't. It's in the cellar of the estate. Someone else lives there now.</string>
  <string id="6121064">You didn't take your parents' will?</string>
  <string id="6121067">What daft bastard leaves that behind?</string>
  <string id="6121070">It was old news. You think I've been sitting here for twenty-five years waiting for Leandra to slink back?</string>
  <string id="6121073">Who bought the estate, Gamlen? Perhaps I could speak to them. Was it the Reinhardts?</string>
  <string id="6121076">No one you know. Get used to Lowtown, Sister. That's where we're going to stay.</string>
  <string id="6121085">We should go carefully. Who knows what this many blood mages may have summoned to defend themselves?</string>
  <string id="6121086">I have never seen so many blood mages.</string>
  <string id="6121087">A whole sanctuary of blood mages... I hope we can stand against them.</string>
  <string id="6121088">How powerful are these blood mages? Can we do this without aid?</string>
  <string id="6121089">I will take great pleasure in rooting out this nest of blood mages. It will not be the first.</string>
  <string id="6121090">Really? We're going to just waltz in here and fight dozens of blood mages? Ourselves? All right. I'm game.</string>
  <string id="6121091">If all the mages here have Idunna's power and will, this will be a difficult fight.</string>
  <string id="6121092">I'm guessing these blood mages aren't going to lie down and die nicely. We need to be prepared for anything.</string>
  <string id="6121093">A whole nest of blood mages... This may be more than I can do alone.</string>
  <string id="6121094">Corff the Bartender</string>
  <string id="6121096">I told you before. I always say things that are painfully stupid.</string>
  <string id="6121097">Sometimes I think... you're too good to be with someone like me.</string>
  <string id="6121098">Laughs You know a lot of very stupid girls, do you?</string>
  <string id="6121099">Bethany, can you tell if there's a demon in him?</string>
  <string id="6121100">Is he possessed, Bethany?</string>
  <string id="6121101">Sorry. As it happens, I've tried to avoid learning much about demons.</string>
  <string id="6121104">That kind of knowledge is frowned on in an apostate.</string>
  <string id="6121112">I'm not like you. I wish that I were.</string>
  <string id="6121118">If you were Dalish, my people would have a kingdom by now.</string>
  <string id="6121121">You're beautiful and clever and you never make any mistakes, and I... I don't deserve you.</string>
  <string id="6121124">And half of Thedas would be attacking us. So maybe things worked out for the best.</string>
  <string id="6121125">Does it bother you that I'm human?</string>
  <string id="6121126">Do you wish I were Dalish?</string>
  <string id="6121127">I'm not an elf. There's not much use in wishing otherwise.</string>
  <string id="6121128">I am what I am.</string>
  <string id="6121129">I doubt that I'd have unified the elves and ushered in a golden age.</string>
  <string id="6121130">I doubt I'd have done much.</string>
  <string id="6121131">I guess I'll postpone making myself more elfy.</string>
  <string id="6121132">I won't sharpen my ears, then.</string>
  <string id="6121133">You put yourself down too much.</string>
  <string id="6121134">Don't say that.</string>
  <string id="6121135">I'm not as perfect as you think, Merrill. I'm not some sort of goddess.</string>
  <string id="6121136">Yes you do.</string>
  <string id="6121137">Perhaps you don't, but I deserve you. Did you think of that?</string>
  <string id="6121138">Maybe it doesn't matter.</string>
  <string id="6121139">Speak with Sergeant Joanna in Lowtown before the end of the day.</string>
  <string id="6121140">Hunt down the Amaranthine conspirators hidden throughout the city—they are wearing red Amaranthine finery. When a conspirator is killed, see Sergeant Joanna in Lowtown to receive a reward.</string>
  <string id="6121141">I'm here to help, whenever you need.</string>
  <string id="6121142">You can always count on me.</string>
  <string id="6121143">Oh, that's sweet. This is... strangely difficult. Please, hurry back with his reaction.</string>
  <string id="6121146">All right, but I'm starting to think you just like having me around.</string>
  <string id="6121147">If that's what you want.</string>
  <string id="6121148">You made a mess of it. But it's not the end of the world.</string>
  <string id="6121149">It's over. But I'm still here.</string>
  <string id="6121150">Sergeant Joanna must seek help elsewhere.</string>
  <string id="6121151">No! I'm not saying I'd change you for... I'm making things worse, aren't I?</string>
  <string id="6121154">I just... I'm one of the elvhen. I'm supposed to preserve who we are, and if I...</string>
  <string id="6121157">There are reasons that it's bad to... is it warm in here? Elgar'nan, I'll stop talking now.</string>
  <string id="6121160">After you left, I... I couldn't stop thinking about Pol, and the mirror, and everything that's happened.</string>
  <string id="6121167">Don't ever leave.</string>
  <string id="6121168">I love you.</string>
  <string id="6121169">Do you mean that? Would you have me here, living with you?</string>
  <string id="6121172">Would you tell the world, the knight-commander, that you love an apostate and you will stand beside him?</string>
  <string id="6121173">I want you right here. Until the day we die.</string>
  <string id="6121174">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6121175">For three years, I have lain awake every night, aching for you.</string>
  <string id="6121178">I'm still terrified I'll wake up.</string>
  <string id="6121181">Want a sandwich?</string>
  <string id="6121182">I'm hungry.</string>
  <string id="6121183">You will be an inspiration to generations of romantic poets.</string>
  <string id="6121186">So, not to bring up anything unpleasant, but... the templars were sniffing around my place yesterday.</string>
  <string id="6121189">I barely slipped out the back in time. Is there any chance I could, ah, stay here for a while?</string>
  <string id="6121193">Yes. Stay with me.</string>
  <string id="6121195">You want to live together?</string>
  <string id="6121196">Well, yes.</string>
  <string id="6121199">I thought you might appreciate not having to step over the drunkards in Darktown every time you want to see me.</string>
  <string id="6121202">What do you say?</string>
  <string id="6121203">I'm not ready for that kind of commitment.</string>
  <string id="6121204">No.</string>
  <string id="6121205">This was a bad idea. I think you should go.</string>
  <string id="6121206">Get out of here.</string>
  <string id="6121207">What?</string>
  <string id="6121210">I'm sorry. I just think you're more serious about this than I am. Let's forget it ever happened.</string>
  <string id="6121213">Sorry. You just weren't that good.</string>
  <string id="6121216">I said leave. I don't want to talk about it.</string>
  <string id="6121219">You're breaking up with me?</string>
  <string id="6121222">I... we talked about this. Everything you said, you... used me.</string>
  <string id="6121225">I won't forget this.</string>
  <string id="6121228">Bethany</string>
  <string id="6121229">Carver</string>
  <string id="6121232">I wonder if... if I've made a mistake. Leaving the Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6121242">Then come with me.</string>
  <string id="6121248">I will talk to the viscount about our estate.</string>
  <string id="6121252">Bethany seems unsettled. Talk to her.</string>
  <string id="6121254">Perhaps, but it's one you have to live with now.</string>
  <string id="6121255">Maybe you have.</string>
  <string id="6121256">You're just feeling homesick. Don't second-guess yourself.</string>
  <string id="6121257">You don't mean that.</string>
  <string id="6121258">Who could pass up life in Kirkwall? The city of sunshine and butterflies!</string>
  <string id="6121259">Of course not.</string>
  <string id="6121260">Carver seems disturbed by all of this. Talk to him.</string>
  <string id="6121267">Barks</string>
  <string id="6121313">This is it! Grandfather's will. Mother needs to see this as soon as possible.</string>
  <string id="6121314">We'll take it to her right now.</string>
  <string id="6121315">Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6121318">All right. But hurry.</string>
  <string id="6121324">We should show the will to Mother as soon as we can.</string>
  <string id="6121325">I still want to look around.</string>
  <string id="6121326">Not yet.</string>
  <string id="6121334">I suppose if I hadn't left my people, I never would have met you.</string>
  <string id="6121456">I wasn't! Not... exactly.</string>
  <string id="6121457">Laughs If you were an elf, Master Hawke, birds would swoop down out of the trees and compose songs just for you.</string>
  <string id="6121458">Oh, I don't know, you'd look handsome with pointy ears. Not that you don't now.</string>
  <string id="6121489">Golem</string>
  <string id="6121502">It's nothing. Never mind.</string>
  <string id="6121503">If you're worried about who sent the note, I can go in your place.</string>
  <string id="6121504">Can I help?</string>
  <string id="6121505">This gem sounds pretty impressive. It has a name and everything.</string>
  <string id="6121506">Doesn't seem like nothing.</string>
  <string id="6121507">It's nothing? Just like last time when I found grandfather's will?</string>
  <string id="6121508">You're hiding something.</string>
  <string id="6121509">You want to keep the gem for yourself, is that it?</string>
  <string id="6121510">You're hiding something.</string>
  <string id="6121511">Bah! Don't be stupid.</string>
  <string id="6121545">You recognize this, Uncle?</string>
  <string id="6121548">You found it, huh? The bleeding Gem of Keroshek.</string>
  <string id="6121551">It's not half as impressive as I thought it would be.</string>
  <string id="6121554">You going to tell who you got this from?</string>
  <string id="6121555">Guess what? You're a father! Congratulations!</string>
  <string id="6121556">I got it from your daughter.</string>
  <string id="6121557">Don't mess with me, girl. If you don't want to tell me, fine, but... wait...</string>
  <string id="6121558">Don't mess with me, boy. If you don't want to tell me, fine, but... wait...</string>
  <string id="6121561">Your whelp threw the gem at my feet before running off.</string>
  <string id="6121562">I got it from your daughter.</string>
  <string id="6121563">Gamlen, a girl claiming to be your daughter gave this to me.</string>
  <string id="6121564">I got it from your daughter.</string>
  <string id="6121565">You didn't tell Mother about our family's will, so I don't tell you this. Fair's fair, Uncle.</string>
  <string id="6121566">Why should I tell you?</string>
  <string id="6121568">It's not important, Uncle.</string>
  <string id="6121569">No.</string>
  <string id="6121570">Don't bother asking me again. I'm not going to tell you.</string>
  <string id="6121571">No.</string>
  <string id="6121572">Perhaps I found it in a clam shell.</string>
  <string id="6121573">No.</string>
  <string id="6121574">A clam shell. Really.</string>
  <string id="6121577">I see. So all of a sudden my business is none of my business.</string>
  <string id="6121581">What do you want now?</string>
  <string id="6121582">Whoever's sending you love notes attacked me.</string>
  <string id="6121583">You almost got me killed!</string>
  <string id="6121603">Enchantment?</string>
  <string id="6121606">No, not enchantment. Leandra. Can I see her?</string>
  <string id="6121637">Our family home. Did you ever think you'd be here?</string>
  <string id="6121640">You need to get out in the sun, not sit around in this hovel writing your manifesto.</string>
  <string id="6121641">You need to lighten up.</string>
  <string id="6121642">I am trying to save the lives and sanity of generations to come.</string>
  <string id="6121651">The Keeper—my whole clan—will object if we... not that they can possibly hate me any more, I suppose.</string>
  <string id="6121657">The Sink</string>
  <string id="6121660">What did I do?</string>
  <string id="6121663">You'll be the end of my boys!</string>
  <string id="6121665">Let them object.</string>
  <string id="6121667">There's no need for that.</string>
  <string id="6121685">I've made a mess of everything. I know that.</string>
  <string id="6121686">I wouldn't be so sure about that. Some people worship you from afar, you know...</string>
  <string id="6121687">Did you call the Maker a dirty name, then?</string>
  <string id="6121697">I always wanted to bring you children back to meet your grandparents.</string>
  <string id="6121700">Now, I wish we'd stayed in Ferelden.</string>
  <string id="6121701">What exactly did I do?</string>
  <string id="6121751">I know that you mean well. I just wish...</string>
  <string id="6121752">I wish... I were more like you.</string>
  <string id="6121754">Is Iwan truly mad?</string>
  <string id="6121755">Is Iwan truly mad?</string>
  <string id="6121756">I don't care what they think of us. I only care about you.</string>
  <string id="6121757">Their disapproval is a small price to pay for being with you.</string>
  <string id="6121758">I'll apologize to them later. I'll even pretend to be sorry.</string>
  <string id="6121759">Nothing is going to happen between us.</string>
  <string id="6121760">I'm not going to do anything that will get you in worse trouble with the Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6121761">The last thing I want is to disappoint the Keeper. I hear that's the stuff of nightmares.</string>
  <string id="6121814">No, of course not. That... would be impossible to imagine, wouldn't it?</string>
  <string id="6121817">Of course. That's... for the best, really.</string>
  <string id="6121820">It is terrible. I wouldn't want you to suffer that.</string>
  <string id="6121857">Anyway, I should go. Thank you for... talking with me, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6121888">A shield. Oh, and, Borne by the one true Ser Aveline. Lovely.</string>
  <string id="6121894">Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6121895">Is this an Orlesian thing? Because it's a bit insulting.</string>
  <string id="6121896">Why did you do that?</string>
  <string id="6121897">I'm sorry. I don't see where I went wrong.</string>
  <string id="6121898">Have I offended?</string>
  <string id="6121899">See? This is why I never get you anything.</string>
  <string id="6121900">No gratitude?</string>
  <string id="6121901">I have a shield. It belonged to Wesley. It has served me well.</string>
  <string id="6121904">I have a shield. It belonged to Wesley. You seem to recognize its worth as you pass it around.</string>
  <string id="6121907">Are you suggesting that I give it up entirely? Pawn it away and be done with it?</string>
  <string id="6121910">I had a shield. It belonged to Wesley. It was difficult to let it go, but I did so.</string>
  <string id="6121913">Utility over sentiment, right? We sold it, didn't we?</string>
  <string id="6121916">What are you going on about?</string>
  <string id="6121919">You're taking this a bit seriously.</string>
  <string id="6121922">And here I thought I was being nice.</string>
  <string id="6121925">You're not usually gentle in your criticism. So what, exactly, was your intent?</string>
  <string id="6121926">If you didn't think this would upset me, what was your intent?</string>
  <string id="6121927">How about you give me a reason for this little tiff.</string>
  <string id="6121928">No, you explain yourself.</string>
  <string id="6121929">You want me to give up on the last bits of my old life. Maybe I'm not willing to do that.</string>
  <string id="6121932">Better tell Donnic.</string>
  <string id="6121935">Oh, just let him rest.</string>
  <string id="6121939">You're over Wesley, aren't you?</string>
  <string id="6121940">If you're still aching for your husband, you may want to inform Donnic.</string>
  <string id="6121943">Last I checked, you were the one who decided to let the man rest.</string>
  <string id="6121946">It's not about Wesley.</string>
  <string id="6121949">It's not enough to want you to be happy?</string>
  <string id="6121950">To be nice?</string>
  <string id="6121951">Happy is for fools.</string>
  <string id="6121954">Okay, it's not the shield, is it.</string>
  <string id="6121957">No, and it's not Wesley.</string>
  <string id="6121960">You've got me doing a lot of things. Some I don't agree with. Some, I'm surprised I do.</string>
  <string id="6121963">I'm not sure where I'm going as it is. Replacing what I was with this... I mean, who is Ser Aveline to me?</string>
  <string id="6121966">Ser Aveline was a fine figure, but I don't revere failure, however glorious.</string>
  <string id="6121967">You don't want it, fine. I'll put it to use somewhere else.</string>
  <string id="6121968">Then I'll take it back.</string>
  <string id="6121969">I appreciate that, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6121972">Sometimes I wonder.</string>
  <string id="6121975">I thought of you when I found it. Maybe that was foolish.</string>
  <string id="6121976">It's just a gift for a friend.</string>
  <string id="6121977">I can appreciate that.</string>
  <string id="6121980">Then accept it on those merits. Nothing more.</string>
  <string id="6121983">It is a fine shield.</string>
  <string id="6121986">You do know that Orlesian smiths slap Ser Aveline’s name on every second piece of armor. This didn't really belong to her.</string>
  <string id="6121989">It does now.</string>
  <string id="6121992">If you're going to wallow in regrets, pick the one with better equipment.</string>
  <string id="6121993">I don't care, just use it.</string>
  <string id="6121994">No.</string>
  <string id="6121997">It's not a debate.</string>
  <string id="6122000">Then we agree. You have my sword, but out of loyalty, not service.</string>
  <string id="6122003">Keep the shield. It's not fit for a member of the guard.</string>
  <string id="6122007">Don't make it such a big deal.</string>
  <string id="6122008">So it's just a shield.</string>
  <string id="6122020">Come here, you! </string>
  <string id="6122021">Get up!</string>
  <string id="6122028">Poor thing! Maybe he'd be happier if we brought him with us more often.</string>
  <string id="6122037">We'll need to give them answers by tomorrow, Captain.</string>
  <string id="6122040">I'll have them. Dismissed.</string>
  <string id="6122043">The seneschal was particularly vocal—</string>
  <string id="6122046">Dismissed.</string>
  <string id="6122061">You'd think the captain of the guard could requisition a templar or two, but no, that would be demeaning.</string>
  <string id="6122064">Can't have them working for the people when eternity needs a nanny.</string>
  <string id="6122065">The viscount won't commit what I need, not to an interim captain, and not at risk of offending the templars.</string>
  <string id="6122068">I thought Captain Jeven left because of... personal failures, but this mess—it's just the way it is.</string>
  <string id="6122069">Poor girl, can't make everyone jump on command?</string>
  <string id="6122070">Tough it out.</string>
  <string id="6122071">I'm captain, not viscount. I didn't expect to sleep through this.</string>
  <string id="6122074">The occasional night would be nice, though. And it's mostly your fault.</string>
  <string id="6122077">Me?</string>
  <string id="6122080">The coin you brought to this city turned it like a lopsided cart.</string>
  <string id="6122081">You had to know cleaning up this mess would be difficult.</string>
  <string id="6122082">Not what you expected?</string>
  <string id="6122083">It's not the challenge. It's the unending part. And really, I blame you.</string>
  <string id="6122086">You poured money into a pot that was already full. Everything has shifted.</string>
  <string id="6122089">Good job validating the fears of every anti-Fereldan in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6122090">That's why I remain unimportant. Less pressure.</string>
  <string id="6122091">Glad it's not my job.</string>
  <string id="6122092">As if the return of the Amells hasn't set Hightown on its ear.</string>
  <string id="6122095">As long as it's off its ass.</string>
  <string id="6122098">Sure, have your fun. But the coin you poured into Kirkwall tipped what balance there was.</string>
  <string id="6122099">I didn't realize I was making it worse by getting ahead.</string>
  <string id="6122100">My success is your headache?</string>
  <string id="6122101">I'm just harassing you. Although you are a bit like the center of a hurricane.</string>
  <string id="6122104">You've changed fortunes for many people. Not always for the better.</string>
  <string id="6122105">After the last captain, you couldn't have expected this to be easy.</string>
  <string id="6122106">You knew Jeven left a mess.</string>
  <string id="6122107">At least I had the guards on my side. Once they understood, they rallied.</string>
  <string id="6122110">And those who didn't weren't fit to hold the crest.</string>
  <string id="6122113">Stack friends against the enemies, I don't know if I came out ahead. But it's for the better.</string>
  <string id="6122114">You were promoted fast. I expected something was unusual about that.</string>
  <string id="6122115">The old captain left a mess?</string>
  <string id="6122116">Jeven took strange risks, but there was nothing incriminating. He retired suddenly, and wasn't missed by many.</string>
  <string id="6122122">The men need a strong leader. I think the viscount made me captain just to shut me up about that.</string>
  <string id="6122123">Sounds like you're spreading yourself pretty thin.</string>
  <string id="6122124">You need more resources?</string>
  <string id="6122125">There are a lot of people in my charge. Someone has to look out for them.</string>
  <string id="6122128">You guard the guardsmen?</string>
  <string id="6122131">I don't turn people loose like Jeven. There's additional training, doubled patrols.</string>
  <string id="6122134">Costs are up, but I've halved injuries. I'll take it, and argue with Seneschal Bran later.</string>
  <string id="6122135">Grouse all you want, but the Aveline I know doesn't regret a second as captain.</string>
  <string id="6122136">You love it.</string>
  <string id="6122137">They'd have to drag me out of here. And I'm sure some are lining up to try.</string>
  <string id="6122140">You among them, I bet. Haven't had much time to follow you around.</string>
  <string id="6122143">That's probably best, from what I've seen.</string>
  <string id="6122146">Not that I need to. I can trust that you at least try to do right.</string>
  <string id="6122149">The door is right there. I'll put you to work.</string>
  <string id="6122150">So quit.</string>
  <string id="6122151">You've said that a few times. Bust heads for you and leave the paperwork behind.</string>
  <string id="6122154">It has its appeal. But that's not really me, is it?</string>
  <string id="6122157">Besides, I know what you get up to. A casual partnership is enough.</string>
  <string id="6122160">I'm with you if you need me, Hawke. And I'm watching, just to be safe.</string>
  <string id="6122163">Besides, you're not the worst thing on the street. I have to split my time where I'm needed.</string>
  <string id="6122166">I'm with you if you need me, Hawke. Just say the word.</string>
  <string id="6122208">You can't save me, Hawke. It's not worth trying.</string>
  <string id="6122211">Maybe then you'd think of me as... more than a bumbling idiot.</string>
  <string id="6122212">If you want to be more like me, then stand up for yourself.</string>
  <string id="6122213">Stop putting yourself down.</string>
  <string id="6122214">I worry about you, Merrill, but I don't think less of you.</string>
  <string id="6122215">I don't think you're an idiot.</string>
  <string id="6122216">Then we'd have nothing to talk about and we'd just stand around a lot. Awkward.</string>
  <string id="6122217">You don't want to be like me.</string>
  <string id="6122224">It's foolish of me to even dream that you might...</string>
  <string id="6122226">Maybe I already do.</string>
  <string id="6122228">You're a good friend.</string>
  <string id="6122230">I won't give up on you.</string>
  <string id="6122232">It's not you I'm protecting.</string>
  <string id="6122238">Gascard!</string>
  <string id="6122239">City life not agreeing with you?</string>
  <string id="6122240">What's wrong, boy?</string>
  <string id="6122241">Come on, let's play fetch the invisible ball!</string>
  <string id="6122242">Want to play?</string>
  <string id="6122363">I'm not letting you destroy your own life.</string>
  <string id="6122364">I'm not abandoning you.</string>
  <string id="6122365">You sure? I'm getting really good at this hero thing.</string>
  <string id="6122366">I'm trying to save everyone else from you.</string>
  <string id="6122367">I only want to make sure that no one else gets hurt.</string>
  <string id="6122368">You could muck about with demons and blood magic to your heart's content if it didn't endanger Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6122432">You're back!</string>
  <string id="6122435">I can still find the killer for you.</string>
  <string id="6122438">Hawke? What are you doing here? Do you have something?</string>
  <string id="6122439">My mother's gone. She received white lilies this morning.</string>
  <string id="6122440">The killer has my mother.</string>
  <string id="6122441">So soon? I wasn't expecting this.</string>
  <string id="6122444">You... could say that. I think my mother's been taken.</string>
  <string id="6122445">In a manner of speaking.</string>
  <string id="6122446">I want this killer, and you're going to help me find him.</string>
  <string id="6122447">I must find the killer.</string>
  <string id="6122449">You could've tracked the killer this whole time? Why haven't you done it?</string>
  <string id="6122450">Why have you waited so long?</string>
  <string id="6122451">I lost the power to confront him when you destroyed my shades.</string>
  <string id="6122455">Tracking Alessa will require you to use blood magic, won't it?</string>
  <string id="6122456">Alessa's blood? Blood magic?</string>
  <string id="6122457">Use the blood. I need to find my mother.</string>
  <string id="6122458">Do it.</string>
  <string id="6122459">Stand back. If there is anything left of Alessa in this world, this ritual will find it.</string>
  <string id="6122462">I'll find the killer some other way. Keep your blood magic.</string>
  <string id="6122463">No, blood magic is wrong.</string>
  <string id="6122464">I... understand. I'll be here if you change your mind.</string>
  <string id="6122470">Hmm... bloodstains on the floor. My spell indicates that Alessa is close by.</string>

  <string id="6122503">I'll speak to my superiors and the city guard immediately.</string>
  <string id="6122504">Please send word if you receive any news.</string>
  <string id="6122505">Tell me if you hear anything.</string>
  <string id="6122507">The templars and the city guard? Great. It's the Coalition of Getting Nothing Done.</string>
  <string id="6122508">You're no help.</string>
  <string id="6122509">So you'll speak to your superiors? That's all you can manage?</string>
  <string id="6122510">That's it?</string>
  <string id="6122511">If I knew where to find this man, I would see him impaled on the point of my sword. But I don't.</string>

  <string id="6122531">So this is it? Grandfather's will? Let's just take it back to Mother and be done with it.</string>
  <string id="6122532">I don't think there's any point in delaying the news.</string>
  <string id="6122533">Yes, let's go back now.</string>
  <string id="6122534">I'll head for the door soon enough. I want to look around first.</string>
  <string id="6122535">Not yet.</string>
  <string id="6122539">Head for the door. If the will is so important, let's get it back to Mother.</string>
  <string id="6122551">Tobrius</string>
  <string id="6122726">This is... is it cold in here? I'm having trouble staying warm.</string>
  <string id="6122729">Ever since the Fade, and that... thing, inside Feynriel.</string>
  <string id="6122730">You have something you want to say about that?</string>
  <string id="6122731">Planning to apologize?</string>
  <string id="6122732">What about it?</string>
  <string id="6122735">I figured you'd try to make up for turning on me.</string>
  <string id="6122738">Any ill effects?</string>
  <string id="6122739">Feeling better?</string>
  <string id="6122740">It keeps drifting back. I can feel... the want of it.</string>
  <string id="6122743">It must have been strong to turn you.</string>
  <string id="6122746">Strong's not the word. I can deal with strong. This was... I don't know.</string>
  <string id="6122749">It took a memory I was at peace with and... well...</string>
  <string id="6122752">Nice job resisting. Really gave it your all.</string>
  <string id="6122753">You were too weak.</string>
  <string id="6122754">It was a demon.</string>
  <string id="6122757">And you gave in.</string>
  <string id="6122760">That thing perverted a memory that I was at peace with! It cut me open.</string>
  <string id="6122763">If that's what mages contend with... I'm less opposed to the Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6122764">Should I be locked up?</string>
  <string id="6122765">Even for me?</string>
  <string id="6122766">Locking up all mages goes too far. I thought we agreed on that.</string>
  <string id="6122767">You don't mean that.</string>
  <string id="6122768">I don't know. Who could resist that?</string>
  <string id="6122771">Anders didn't. And seems quite proud of the fact.</string>
  <string id="6122774">Merrill aches for some sort of bargain. It's obvious.</string>
  <string id="6122777">I'm left to think... mages are either willful in a way I can't understand, or not mortal.</string>
  <string id="6122780">I don't find either comforting.</string>
  <string id="6122783">I don't want to think about it. What's the captain of the guard doing in the Fade anyway?</string>
  <string id="6122786">I don't disagree that the Circle is necessary. Within reason.</string>
  <string id="6122787">With Circle control, I agree.</string>
  <string id="6122788">Was there any reason behind what we encountered? There was thought, but it was... so focused.</string>
  <string id="6122791">Are we supposed to understand that? Are we built for that?</string>
  <string id="6122794">I wasn't meant to know. Of that, I am certain.</string>
  <string id="6122797">Let's... not do that again any time soon, Hawke. Promise?</string>
  <string id="6122800">Maybe you're not as at peace with your past as you think.</string>
  <string id="6122801">Blame your memory.</string>
  <string id="6122802">I harbor one regret, and I deserved to have my mind stripped of control?</string>
  <string id="6122805">I suppose the wealthy beg for thieves. And the beautiful invite rape.</string>
  <string id="6122808">That's a bit much.</string>
  <string id="6122811">Right. You're a mage. This is normal to you.</string>
  <string id="6122814">Is it? It wasn't in your head.</string>
  <string id="6122817">I don't want to think about it, Hawke. I wasn't meant to.</string>
  <string id="6122822">Lowtown</string>
  <string id="6122824">In the meantime, you should return to where your mother was last seen. You may find some clues.</string>
  <string id="6122830">It's Alessa. Sighs</string>
  <string id="6122833">Her eyes... are gone. Someone took her eyes!</string>
  <string id="6122851">This blood is fresh.</string>
  <string id="6122854">There are lingering traces of... something. I think this was used for blood magic.</string>
  <string id="6122860">I know this locket. It belongs to Mother.</string>
  <string id="6122861">Don't do that again.</string>
  <string id="6122865">Isabela</string>
  <string id="6122871">That woman in the portrait looks like Leandra, doesn't she?</string>
  <string id="6122875">A shrine dedicated to a wife? A sister?</string>
  <string id="6122876">If I ever make anything this pathetic, do me a favor and stick a dagger in my eye.</string>
  <string id="6122877">This man is either very devoted or very insane.</string>
  <string id="6122878">Creepy.</string>
  <string id="6122879">Ooh, that's a pretty little shrine.</string>
  <string id="6122889">Blessed art thou who exists in the sight of the Maker! Blessed art thou who seeks His forgiveness!</string>
  <string id="6122901">Blessed are the champions of the just! They shall forever thrive in the Maker's eyes!</string>
  <string id="6122905">Do you have any idea what I have sacrificed for this city? You are unworthy of victory!</string>
  <string id="6122906">I promise I'll consider it.</string>
  <string id="6122907">Done.</string>
  <string id="6122908">If I learn anything new, you'll be the first to hear about it.</string>
  <string id="6122915">I have something for you.</string>
  <string id="6122923">I just wanted to help. I thought you'd like to have something that reminded you of the sea.</string>
  <string id="6122924">I wasn't trying to upset you.</string>
  <string id="6122925">Grunts I suppose it is rather cute.</string>

  <string id="6123224">Chuckles</string>
  <string id="6123229">That's not true. You care about Kirkwall and her people, as much as you hate to admit it.</string>
  <string id="6123230">Surprise!</string>
  <string id="6123233">I found this. You should have it.</string>
  <string id="6123236">I've something I think you might like.</string>
  <string id="6123253">Darktown: Emeric's Investigation</string>
  <string id="6123307">Quentin!</string>
  <string id="6123310">Gascard? So you've reached me after all these years. I figured you gave up.</string>
  <string id="6123311">Gascard wishes to avenge his sister. He'd never give up.</string>
  <string id="6123312">And let his sister down?</string>
  <string id="6123315">Where is she?</string>
  <string id="6123318">You lying dirtbag. Why didn't you tell me his name was Quentin!</string>
  <string id="6123319">You knew his name?</string>
  <string id="6123327">This was what it was about all along?</string>
  <string id="6123328">You lied to me?</string>
  <string id="6123329">Oh, I do intend to kill him.</string>
  <string id="6123332">I'll kill you for this deception!</string>
  <string id="6123333">You're dead, Gascard.</string>
  <string id="6123334">I didn't deceive you totally! The plan was always to kill Quentin. And we can still work together!</string>
  <string id="6123337">I had other things on my mind.</string>
  <string id="6123340">You promised you'd teach me, Quentin! You're going to deliver on that promise!</string>
  <string id="6123350">But now my work is finished, and I can teach you as I always meant to. Come back to me, Gascard.</string>
  <string id="6123356">I— Grunts</string>
  <string id="6123359">What? You were going to do that, right?</string>
  <string id="6123360">I will keep nothing from you.</string>
  <string id="6123363">If you join him, you die with him.</string>
  <string id="6123364">Then you both die.</string>
  <string id="6123365">Don't you see what he's done? What part of this is worth having?</string>
  <string id="6123366">Look at what he's become.</string>
  <string id="6123367">Quentin's a madman. You don't want to join him.</string>
  <string id="6123368">Don't do this.</string>
  <string id="6123373">You're powerful, Hawke, but not that powerful.</string>
  <string id="6123377">You don't know me. You don't know what I want.</string>
  <string id="6123381">To coax life from dead flesh... I always imagined it would be glorious.</string>
  <string id="6123387">You disappoint me, Gascard. I always thought you, of all people, would understand.</string>
  <string id="6123388">You will never understand my purpose. Your mother was chosen because she was special, and now she is part of something... greater.</string>
  <string id="6123389">Spare me the demented rambling. Where is she?</string>
  <string id="6123390">You're insane.</string>
  <string id="6123391">I don't want to hurt anyone. Release my mother, and we'll go.</string>
  <string id="6123392">I just want my mother.</string>
  <string id="6123393">You're crazy. I get it. Where's my mother?</string>
  <string id="6123394">Something... greater?</string>
  <string id="6123395">I have done the impossible. I have touched the face of the Maker and lived.</string>
  <string id="6123408">Did you find her?</string>
  <string id="6123411">She's dead. Murdered.</string>
  <string id="6123412">I'm sorry, Uncle. She's gone.</string>
  <string id="6123415">Gone? You mean...  No, it's not true. It can't be true.</string>
  <string id="6123417">It was my fault.</string>
  <string id="6123418">So you're to blame! If you'd been quicker or stronger, you could've... she could be...</string>
  <string id="6123423">I know it hurts, but Mother wouldn't want us to dwell on it.</string>
  <string id="6123424">We have to move on.</string>
  <string id="6123428">I promised to teach you. I didn't promise to teach you everything.</string>
  <string id="6123429">You'll let me be part of this? You'll teach me the secrets of necromancy?</string>
  <string id="6123440">I... I wasn't expecting to see you so soon after... you know.</string>
  <string id="6123650">You aren't going to lose me.</string>
  <string id="6123653">This isn't going to fix that.</string>
  <string id="6123656">You didn't come here to talk.</string>
  <string id="6123659">No mage I know has ever dared to fall in love.</string>
  <string id="6123662">This is the rule I will most cherish breaking.</string>
  <string id="6123694">Meeting Place</string>
  <string id="6123726">No offense to your people, Merrill, but anyone who runs into a monster to escape you has their priorities wrong.</string>
  <string id="6123727">The Dalish seem a bit dense.</string>
  <string id="6123728">They're... just confused. But it doesn't matter. I'll still save them.</string>
  <string id="6123731">So you're willing to burn along with me?</string>
  <string id="6123734">Maybe I want you to abandon me. Did you consider that?</string>
  <string id="6123737">And what makes you think I need a hero?</string>
  <string id="6123750">You think I'm that careless?</string>
  <string id="6124021">So you want me to fight with you more?</string>
  <string id="6124022">You say that, but I know it's not true.</string>
  <string id="6124023">Terrible fate! Whatever would we do to fill the silence?</string>
  <string id="6124040">If you stick with me, you and everyone you love will be in danger.</string>
  <string id="6124047">Do you understand? I... I can't bear if anything happens to you because of me.</string>
  <string id="6124048">I told you, I won't let that happen.</string>
  <string id="6124049">You can't scare me off.</string>
  <string id="6124050">It will be all right, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6124051">Don't be afraid.</string>
  <string id="6124052">Think of it as an adventure. You make my life exciting.</string>
  <string id="6124053">Safety is boring.</string>
  <string id="6124141">I found this note on a thug who attacked me. It mentions your wallop mallet.</string>
  <string id="6124142">We need to talk.</string>
  <string id="6124143">What in the Maker's name is a wallop mallet?</string>
  <string id="6124144">I have a question for you.</string>
  <string id="6124145">I found this note on one of the thugs. Something about your wallop mallet.</string>
  <string id="6124148">Huh. Haven't played wallop since I was a kid. Still got my mallet up on the wall, though. Last time I was any good at something.</string>
  <string id="6124239">Your mother ran away!</string>
  <string id="6124242">I thought she abandoned us. I was angry. I didn't think she deserved what was left to her.</string>
  <string id="6124245">If I'd have known how much it hurt her... maybe I would have done things differently.</string>
  <string id="6124280">Let me tell you what I know about destiny.</string>
  <string id="6124283">Some men fight against it with every fiber of their being.</string>
  <string id="6124286">Some men fear it. Those ones you find on their knees, begging for mercy.</string>
  <string id="6124289">But every now and then someone comes along who embraces his destiny.</string>
  <string id="6124292">But every now and then there's one who embraces destiny.</string>
  <string id="6124295">That one, my friend... he changes the world forever.</string>
  <string id="6124298">This is a story you have to hear.</string>
  <string id="6124299">Some legends need to be told.</string>
  <string id="6124300">This is where the legend begins.</string>
  <string id="6124361">That doesn't make up for what you did.</string>
  <string id="6124362">I'm still not telling you.</string>
  <string id="6124365">No. It couldn't be. Mara? She wouldn't have kept something like this from me, would she?</string>
  <string id="6124368">I need a drink. Just... leave me awhile, would you?</string>
  <string id="6124371">Don't save me. Please, just... don't.</string>
  <string id="6124403">You really think I would let anyone else come to harm with what I'm doing?</string>
  <string id="6124406">I... suppose I should have known. I should go. Thank you for hearing me out, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6124419">You worry too much.</string>
  <string id="6124420">You don't have to dream about it.</string>
  <string id="6124421">I thought I was pretty obvious already, but I could spell it out for you.</string>
  <string id="6124422">We're friends. Nothing more.</string>
  <string id="6124423">You're like a sister to me, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6124673">Maker's blessing, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6124676">Have you come to pray?</string>
  <string id="6124678">I want to talk about mages.</string>
  <string id="6124679">Have you thought about which side you'll take? Between the mages and templars?</string>
  <string id="6124682">So... hypothetically, if there were a group of people being brutally subjugated by another...</string>
  <string id="6124685">You speak of mages.</string>
  <string id="6124688">Yes. No! Yes.</string>
  <string id="6124691">Why have you let the templars continue their oppression of mages?</string>
  <string id="6124694">It's no secret that you count apostates among your friends, Champion. You have done much to fan the flames of rebellion here.</string>
  <string id="6124697">We must give Meredith and Orsino time to work out their differences. No good can come of showing favor to one side.</string>
  <string id="6124698">Couldn't you solve this problem if you just spoke out?</string>
  <string id="6124699">Why not?</string>
  <string id="6124700">How would that help?</string>
  <string id="6124703">Both sides make good points. Both have flaws.</string>
  <string id="6124706">For a thousand years, the Chantry has had to find the balance between them. That hasn't changed here.</string>
  <string id="6124708">So you support the templars?</string>
  <string id="6124709">I understand. You are the voice of the Chantry. You can't turn against its own institutions.</string>
  <string id="6124712">All right, you won't budge on this one. Templars it is.</string>
  <string id="6124715">You're right. The templars serve a purpose.</string>
  <string id="6124718">That's not what I'm saying. I do not support the knight-commander's methods.</string>
  <string id="6124722">The mages need your help.</string>
  <string id="6124723">The Maker created mages. Why doesn't He protect them?</string>
  <string id="6124726">I guess that means you're not ready to disband the templars and set every mage free?</string>
  <string id="6124729">Mages have submitted to the Chantry's will for a thousand years. Will they never be trusted?</string>
  <string id="6124732">I feel for the mages, I do. I would not wish to be locked in the Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6124735">But I cannot take sides. We are all the Maker's creatures, but magic allows abuses beyond the scope of mortals.</string>
  <string id="6124738">I only hope I can balance the needs of everyone. For if it comes to war, it is the people of this city who will lose.</string>
  <string id="6124739">Can you offer me your blessing?</string>
  <string id="6124740">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6124741">May Andraste lend you strength until you ascend to be with the Maker.</string>
  <string id="6124744">This is a grave time. It is good to know you will face it in the Maker's grace.</string>
  <string id="6124748">The Maker abandoned us long ago—if He ever existed. What good would your blessing do me?</string>
  <string id="6124749">The Chantry is a scam.</string>
  <string id="6124750">There are apostates plotting something against the Chantry.</string>
  <string id="6124751">I bring a warning.</string>
  <string id="6124752">And the sky is blue and the rains come in the spring.</string>
  <string id="6124755">No. Truly—</string>
  <string id="6124758">It's no secret you have close associates who are apostates, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6124761">I do not doubt you know of one's plans. But mages have threatened me before.</string>
  <string id="6124764">I cannot turn on my templars, on the very words of Andraste, for fear. No matter how justified that fear might be.</string>
  <string id="6124769">It might help settle that anger. It's hard to accept that there is no divine hand we can look to for guidance.</string>
  <string id="6124772">But mankind has turned on the Maker twice. Now we are the ones who must prove our love for Him.</string>
  <string id="6124775">Is there some other reason you're here?</string>
  <string id="6124778">I was just leaving.</string>
  <string id="6124779">No.</string>
  <string id="6124780">You are the Maker's child, Champion. Whether you embrace Him or not.</string>
  <string id="6124786">There you are. I've been looking for you all over.</string>
  <string id="6124789">Your Grace.</string>
  <string id="6124792">Your soul is troubled, child. I hope you found a balm for it here.</string>
  <string id="6125106">Maybe there's still a way to change the Circle from within.</string>
  <string id="6125107">You've made it abundantly clear where you stand, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6125108">Your support has meant the world to me.</string>
  <string id="6125118">I wanted you to have this.</string>
  <string id="6125121">What's that, a... pillow?</string>
  <string id="6125124">Hand-embroidered by my mother. The only thing of hers they let me keep when I went to the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6125127">Why in the name of Andraste would you give that to me?</string>
  <string id="6125130">You've been a good friend, Varric.</string>
  <string id="6125133">Uh-uh. You keep your pillow, Blondie. And may you have many more dreams of killing templars on it.</string>
  <string id="6125142">I didn't realize you'd be home.</string>
  <string id="6125145">Hawke. I didn't think you'd come back here.</string>
  <string id="6125148">I know you don't understand why I must do what I do, but I thought maybe you'd support me.</string>
  <string id="6125149">You never even told me what you're doing!</string>
  <string id="6125150">Support you in what?</string>
  <string id="6125151">I'm trying to protect you.</string>
  <string id="6125154">There's no reason we both need to hang.</string>
  <string id="6125155">I believe in your cause. It's just your methods I question.</string>
  <string id="6125156">I do support you.</string>
  <string id="6125157">Revolutions do not happen peacefully.</string>
  <string id="6125160">Vague threats and pretentious speeches? Not the best way to change my mind.</string>
  <string id="6125161">You thought wrong.</string>
  <string id="6125162">You're the one who jerked me around with that ridiculous story about the Tevinter potion!</string>
  <string id="6125163">You lied to me!</string>
  <string id="6125164">I told you. I'm a liar. I'm a monster. I never claimed I would do anything but hurt you.</string>
  <string id="6125167">Should I have told you the truth? There's no one in Kirkwall I wouldn't kill to see mages free.</string>
  <string id="6125170">How would you have reacted to that?</string>
  <string id="6125171">There must be a peaceful solution.</string>
  <string id="6125172">You must find a better way.</string>
  <string id="6125173">No.</string>
  <string id="6125176">If you talk to the grand cleric—</string>
  <string id="6125179">No.</string>
  <string id="6125182">If Meredith steps down—</string>
  <string id="6125185">Probably not by saying, Great, let's go.</string>
  <string id="6125186">Badly, I imagine.</string>
  <string id="6125187">The Chantry will never change from within.</string>
  <string id="6125190">They see mages as monsters. They can't imagine a world with room for all of us.</string>
  <string id="6125193">Maybe they're right.</string>
  <string id="6125194">If you want mages to be free, you need to convince people you're not dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6125195">You won't win this way.</string>
  <string id="6125196">Impossible!</string>
  <string id="6125199">All you're doing is proving the templars right!</string>
  <string id="6125202">Do you know how long I've been telling them that? Mage after mage in Kirkwall, turning to blood magic because it's easy!</string>
  <string id="6125205">I always said they were their own worst enemies. But I never thought I... Sighs</string>
  <string id="6125206">Whatever you planned, there's still time to stop it.</string>
  <string id="6125207">It's not too late.</string>
  <string id="6125208">Yes. Time... maybe there's still time.</string>
  <string id="6125214">Leave! This does not concern you!</string>
  <string id="6125215">Leave! This does not concern you!</string>
  <string id="6125216">You will not get justice by becoming what everyone fears.</string>
  <string id="6125217">You must see reason.</string>
  <string id="6125218">I will get justice, by any means required.</string>
  <string id="6125221">I will get justice, by any means required.</string>
  <string id="6125224">Why, hello Justice. It's been so long.</string>
  <string id="6125225">Justice, I presume.</string>
  <string id="6125226">This is Anders's decision, not yours!</string>
  <string id="6125227">Let him go!</string>
  <string id="6125228">I am Anders.</string>
  <string id="6125231">You have given into sloth. You would stand by while mages are abducted and tortured.</string>
  <string id="6125234">Go. Anders has no need of you.</string>
  <string id="6125237">I am Anders.</string>
  <string id="6125240">You have given into sloth. You would stand by while mages are abducted and tortured.</string>
  <string id="6125243">Go. Anders has no need of you.</string>
  <string id="6125249">What was I saying?</string>
  <string id="6125250">You... don't know what just happened?</string>
  <string id="6125251">You don't remember?</string>
  <string id="6125252">No. What do—</string>
  <string id="6125255">Your better half doesn't like me.</string>
  <string id="6125256">Justice came out.</string>
  <string id="6125257">Oh. I'm having more... blanks in my memory. It's like the longer we go, the less of me there is.</string>
  <string id="6125260">You were right all along. I should never have done this.</string>
  <string id="6125263">I will see... maybe it's still not too late to change things.</string>
  <string id="6125265">You are beyond help.</string>
  <string id="6125266">You were right. You are a monster.</string>
  <string id="6125269">Being with you, loving you, I thought it would make a difference, but he's too strong.</string>
  <string id="6125272">I've tried my best. Don't hate me for failing.</string>
  <string id="6125273">It doesn't matter. It's pretty clear who's in charge here.</string>
  <string id="6125274">Forget it. Nothing I say will get through to you.</string>
  <string id="6125275">I give up.</string>
  <string id="6125282">Oh. You're home.</string>
  <string id="6125285">I want to tell you now, I love you.</string>
  <string id="6125288">Hawke. I... didn't expect you here.</string>
  <string id="6125291">But... let me take this time to tell you how much I respect you.</string>
  <string id="6125294">You've stood by me, when I gave you every reason to turn away.</string>
  <string id="6125297">Just remember, whatever happens, I wanted you to know that.</string>
  <string id="6125298">Why are you talking like this?</string>
  <string id="6125299">What's going on?</string>
  <string id="6125300">He'll still be here, you know—Justice—long after you and I are gone.</string>
  <string id="6125303">It doesn't mean the same thing to a spirit. He'll just go back to the Fade.</string>
  <string id="6125305">I don't want to lose you.</string>
  <string id="6125307">I know it.</string>
  <string id="6125308">I love you, Anders.</string>
  <string id="6125311">You've been a good friend.</string>
  <string id="6125314">No. I haven't, and I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6125317">Usually people don't say things like that unless they're about to stab someone in the back.</string>
  <string id="6125318">Is this when you betray me?</string>
  <string id="6125319">I love you. I wish that meant I would never hurt you.</string>
  <string id="6125322">You are the most important thing in my life.</string>
  <string id="6125325">But some things matter more than my life, more than either of us. I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6125326">You're wrong. There is nothing more important than love!</string>
  <string id="6125327">Love is important!</string>
  <string id="6125328">If you were curious, that's not the best way to get me in the mood.</string>
  <string id="6125329">Way to kill the mood.</string>
  <string id="6125330">I told you I would break your heart. Just know it breaks mine to do it.</string>
  <string id="6125333">This is war. We cannot be weakened by our feelings.</string>
  <string id="6125334">You're right.</string>
  <string id="6125335">I knew you would understand.</string>
  <string id="6125338">None of this is aimed at you, Hawke. I think I've made that clear.</string>
  <string id="6125341">I'm not expecting this to end with anything less than overthrowing the templars.</string>
  <string id="6125342">I'm ready for war.</string>
  <string id="6125343">Then you will not be disappointed.</string>
  <string id="6125346">I was hoping we'd find a better way, but... Justice and Vengeance are too intertwined. I can't tell one from the other.</string>
  <string id="6125349">You are the one shining light in my life. Never blame yourself for what will happen.</string>
  <string id="6125350">You have been a better friend than I ever thought to have.</string>
  <string id="6125356">Leave me. I have preparations to make.</string>
  <string id="6125360">I cannot tell you how good it feels for a spirit to fulfill its function.</string>
  <string id="6125363">The waiting is over. I am finally seeking justice. And he is exultant.</string>
  <string id="6125366">There is no ecstasy humankind can feel to match.</string>
  <string id="6125367">Are you going to tell me what you did?</string>
  <string id="6125368">What happened in the chantry?</string>
  <string id="6125369">You are Kirkwall's Champion.</string>
  <string id="6125372">You can better aid our cause in that role than by aligning yourself with me too closely here.</string>
  <string id="6125373">Every time you refuse to tell me, I have to imagine something crazier.</string>
  <string id="6125374">This gets worse and worse.</string>
  <string id="6125375">This isn't a fight for sane men.</string>
  <string id="6125379">Be careful.</string>
  <string id="6125380">Whatever you're doing, it's not worth your life.</string>
  <string id="6125383">Oh, it is. One human life would be a small price for freedom.</string>
  <string id="6125386">Don't despair for me, love. This is what I was born to do.</string>
  <string id="6125389">You're scaring me. You sound possessed.</string>
  <string id="6125392">I am possessed. And it's never felt better.</string>
  <string id="6125395">You should bottle that stuff. You'd make a fortune.</string>
  <string id="6125396">I'd like to try it.</string>
  <string id="6125397">I would share it if I could, love.</string>
  <string id="6125400">Ha. I don't think most people would be willing to pay the price.</string>
  <string id="6125403">Even Justice bows to you for the faith you have shown us.</string>
  <string id="6125406">A victory for mages will be a victory for you.</string>
  <string id="6125407">Then you are finally ready to face the knight-commander?</string>
  <string id="6125408">So you're ready to fight?</string>
  <string id="6125409">The war will happen. The clock is ticking down. It will be midnight soon.</string>
  <string id="6125412">Leave me in peace. I have much to do.</string>
  <string id="6125416">There is one more thing I need of you, my love. And I can't tell you why.</string>
  <string id="6125419">There is one more thing I would ask of you, Hawke. And I can't tell you why.</string>
  <string id="6125422">I must get inside the chantry, without being seen.</string>
  <string id="6125425">Will you talk to the grand cleric for me? Distract her long enough for me to do what must be done?</string>
  <string id="6125426">What do you want me to talk about?</string>
  <string id="6125427">What should I say?</string>
  <string id="6125428">Food? The weather? What does it matter?</string>
  <string id="6125431">No, talk of mages. Give her one final chance to hear what we have suffered. To pick a side.</string>
  <string id="6125435">Perhaps she'll be more inclined to listen to you.</string>
  <string id="6125437">What must be done?</string>
  <string id="6125438">What are you plotting?</string>
  <string id="6125441">Tell me your plan.</string>
  <string id="6125444">You would not thank me if I told you.</string>
  <string id="6125447">If you support freedom for mages, help me. That's all I can say.</string>
  <string id="6125448">What is it you don't want me to see?</string>
  <string id="6125449">This sounds suspicious.</string>
  <string id="6125450">Do you believe in me, love? Do you believe mages deserve to live free of the templars' grasp?</string>
  <string id="6125453">You said you believe in me. Again and again, you have shown your support for mages.</string>
  <string id="6125456">Then trust me now. I am doing only what is necessary.</string>
  <string id="6125457">Was this ever about you and Justice? Or have you lied this whole time?</string>
  <string id="6125458">Is there even a potion?</string>
  <string id="6125459">I lied. There is no potion.</string>
  <string id="6125462">But what we have gathered will bring freedom for more than just me and Justice. It will help mages throughout Thedas.</string>
  <string id="6125465">In the face of that, one lie means little.</string>
  <string id="6125466">I can't act blindly. Tell me your plan.</string>
  <string id="6125467">Do you trust me?</string>
  <string id="6125468">No. Whatever you're doing, you know I'd disapprove. That's why you won't tell me.</string>
  <string id="6125469">I cannot help you.</string>
  <string id="6125470">I am taking a risk. I would not see you drawn into it.</string>
  <string id="6125473">But maybe your support of mages ends at talk. It's easy to support freedom if no one must die to achieve it.</string>
  <string id="6125476">You cannot claim to love me, then turn on me now.</string>
  <string id="6125477">You cannot pretend friendship, then stop now.</string>
  <string id="6125478">I care for you. That doesn't mean I agree with every decision.</string>
  <string id="6125479">I do love you.</string>
  <string id="6125480">You cannot care for me and despise what I stand for.</string>
  <string id="6125483">I am the cause of mages. There is nothing else inside me.</string>
  <string id="6125486">Will you aid us now? Or does your support stop at the chantry door?</string>
  <string id="6125487">Tell me what you would have of me, then. But I won't forget you blackmailed me to get it.</string>
  <string id="6125488">Fine. I will help.</string>
  <string id="6125492">That's unfair. I will not be blackmailed into aiding some mad scheme. You're on your own.</string>
  <string id="6125493">Forget it.</string>
  <string id="6125494">I do trust you.</string>
  <string id="6125495">I will help.</string>
  <string id="6125496">I would not tell you my plans, Hawke. You have made it plain where your sympathies lie.</string>
  <string id="6125499">I will ask you straight, then. Has nothing you've seen changed your mind?</string>
  <string id="6125502">Will you help me free the mages of Kirkwall? Or will you stay at the side of the knight-tyrant?</string>
  <string id="6125503">I won't play the pawn for anyone. </string>
  <string id="6125504">I cannot help you.</string>
  <string id="6125505">I have always been on my own. For a time, I just forgot.</string>
  <string id="6125508">What do you need me to do?</string>
  <string id="6125509">Fine. I will help.</string>
  <string id="6125510">You surprise me again, Hawke. I'm glad these years spent ranting haven't been in vain.</string>
  <string id="6125514">I will help.</string>
  <string id="6125515">You do what you need to do.</string>
  <string id="6125518">I won't desert you now.</string>
  <string id="6125521">I do not deserve your love.</string>
  <string id="6125524">Your loyalty is more than I deserve.</string>
  <string id="6125527">I promise: whatever happens, it's on my head. It will not come back on you.</string>
  <string id="6125530">Go to the chantry. Talk to the grand cleric. I will join you when I'm done.</string>
  <string id="6125542">I'm going to be trying something, and I thought you'd want to be part of it.</string>
  <string id="6125545">You've been right all along.</string>
  <string id="6125548">We've both been wrong.</string>
  <string id="6125551">I've been wrong.</string>
  <string id="6125554">What I did with Justice was unnatural. It should never have happened.</string>
  <string id="6125555">I'm glad you finally understand that.</string>
  <string id="6125556">You're right.</string>
  <string id="6125557">Is there some way to undo it?</string>
  <string id="6125558">What does that mean?</string>
  <string id="6125559">You're getting him under control. I've seen it.</string>
  <string id="6125560">You're wrong.</string>
  <string id="6125561">I can't help mages like this. Not while I am everything the templars fear about magic.</string>
  <string id="6125567">I need to be free of this curse.</string>
  <string id="6125569">Tell me how to help.</string>
  <string id="6125570">You know I'll do anything I can.</string>
  <string id="6125573">Your patience with me... I marvel every day that you haven't thrown up your hands and left.</string>
  <string id="6125576">What must we do?</string>
  <string id="6125579">I've never heard of anyone getting... un-possessed.</string>
  <string id="6125580">Is there a way?</string>
  <string id="6125581">You brought this on yourself.</string>
  <string id="6125582">Impossible.</string>
  <string id="6125583">I did. But I think there's a way out.</string>
  <string id="6125586">I've spent the past three years researching the methods of Tevinter magisters.</string>
  <string id="6125589">They're the only ones who have ever sought to reverse spirit possession, not just behead the victims.</string>
  <string id="6125592">I believe I have a formula for a potion that can separate Justice and me. Without killing either.</string>
  <string id="6125593">Surely that's worth any risk it entails.</string>
  <string id="6125594">Let's do it.</string>
  <string id="6125595">That was going to be my next question.</string>
  <string id="6125596">Well, that's good.</string>
  <string id="6125597">I knew you'd stand behind me in this. Even if...</string>
  <string id="6125600">What?</string>
  <string id="6125603">Nothing.</string>
  <string id="6125606">I've gathered most of what I need, but there are some... outlandish ingredients I was hoping you'd help me collect.</string>
  <string id="6125609">A powder the Tevinters call sela petrae, and a small amount of drakestone.</string>
  <string id="6125610">Is it just a potion? Is there anything more to this ritual?</string>
  <string id="6125611">Tell me about this formula.</string>
  <string id="6125612">No, no ritual. Just mix the ingredients up and... boom. Justice and I are free.</string>
  <string id="6125615">And we can take our rightful place among free mages.</string>
  <string id="6125616">Where would we find sela petrae?</string>
  <string id="6125617">Sela petrae?</string>
  <string id="6125618">It's a crystal that forms from concentrated manure and urine.</string>
  <string id="6125621">I suggest we search the sewers. There's an entrance not far from here in Darktown.</string>
  <string id="6125622">What is drakestone?</string>
  <string id="6125623">Drakestone?</string>
  <string id="6125624">The Tevinters used to mine it for their apothecaries. There should still be deposits in the Bone Pit.</string>
  <string id="6125628">I assure you, we'll find them.</string>
  <string id="6125629">Sounds easy enough.</string>
  <string id="6125630">I could not have begun to do this without your support.</string>
  <string id="6125631">That doesn't sound sinister at all...</string>
  <string id="6125632">Those are creepy ingredients.</string>
  <string id="6125633">Well, you know Tevinters. They can't throw a Wintersend party without a human sacrifice or two.</string>
  <string id="6125636">But I promise, everything in my research says there's no blood magic involved.</string>
  <string id="6125640">What aren't you telling me?</string>
  <string id="6125641">Is that... all?</string>
  <string id="6125642">Oh, many things, I'm sure.</string>
  <string id="6125645">Did I tell you about the dream I had where the grand cleric was completely naked except for her miter?</string>
  <string id="6125648">And there was this giant glowing cheese wheel...</string>
  <string id="6125652">I don't want any part of this.</string>
  <string id="6125653">I'm not going to risk my standing by messing with some Imperial ritual.</string>
  <string id="6125656">You can do this without me.</string>
  <string id="6125659">Very well. I can follow this road myself. It is too important to leave undone.</string>
  <string id="6125668">Our cause is nearly lost.</string>
  <string id="6125678">You think I don't know the city guard is just another arm of the templars?</string>
  <string id="6125681">That is completely unfair.</string>
  <string id="6125684">If they show up here, I'll know who to blame. That's all I'm saying.</string>
  <string id="6125687">I'm sorry. I didn't mean for you to see that.</string>
  <string id="6125690">I just... can't be too careful. Now that the knight-commander has basically appointed herself viscount.</string>
  <string id="6125691">The knight-commander is trying to keep order. That's all.</string>
  <string id="6125692">She's hardly the viscount.</string>
  <string id="6125693">I can't even imagine how difficult it is to be a mage here now.</string>
  <string id="6125694">That must be hard.</string>
  <string id="6125695">It's easy for most of them. They're long-since Tranquil.</string>
  <string id="6125698">She's just waiting for the first legitimate excuse to drag me off to the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6125699">It's been awful.</string>
  <string id="6125700">You're our one hope. The Champion of the city, an open apostate. But it's not enough.</string>
  <string id="6125703">Between ruling the city and torturing mages, it's a wonder she has time to keep that sword so shiny.</string>
  <string id="6125704">She's a busy lady.</string>
  <string id="6125705">She has nearly crushed the flame of hope for mages here.</string>
  <string id="6125708">Are you in trouble?</string>
  <string id="6125709">Has she come after you?</string>
  <string id="6125710">Not personally. But I grow less hopeful each day.</string>
  <string id="6125713">Maybe she can stop rebels like you.</string>
  <string id="6125714">Keep your head down.</string>
  <string id="6125715">Oh, yes. Your knight-commander has done a wonderful job crushing rebels. You should be proud.</string>
  <string id="6125718">The mage underground is all but destroyed. And those left have turned to blood magic as their only option.</string>
  <string id="6125721">Which Meredith knows will prevent any chance of the public taking their side.</string>
  <string id="6125723">There's still hope.</string>
  <string id="6125724">There's still us.</string>
  <string id="6125727">There's still one good mage left in the city.</string>
  <string id="6125730">I don't know how you continue to believe in me.</string>
  <string id="6125733">This way there won't be war. You can change things more slowly, from within.</string>
  <string id="6125734">Maybe it's for the best.</string>
  <string id="6125735">How?</string>
  <string id="6125738">You don't think that kind of proves her point?</string>
  <string id="6125739">So, she's right?</string>
  <string id="6125740">If I have any influence here at all, Meredith will not be knight-commander long.</string>
  <string id="6125741">We will stop her.</string>
  <string id="6125742">I don't know what we would do without you.</string>
  <string id="6125745">How can people be so blind?</string>
  <string id="6125748">All mages are at risk of turning to blood magic.</string>
  <string id="6125749">Mages are dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6125750">At as much risk as you! I have never understood how you stand against your own kind.</string>
  <string id="6125753">A mage saved all of us from the Blight!</string>
  <string id="6125756">The Blight was stopped only with the aid of two mages, one an apostate!</string>
  <string id="6125759">But it makes no difference.</string>
  <string id="6125762">The Chantry set us all on this path long ago. It would take something truly catastrophic to change people's thinking now.</string>
  <string id="6125769">For the Maker's sake, draw the curtains! Do you know what could happen if the knight-commander's spies catch two apostates talking?</string>
  <string id="6125772">No. What?</string>
  <string id="6125775">No wonder the demons found you such easy prey.</string>
  <string id="6125781">Her ignorance will be what draws the templars down on us.</string>
  <string id="6125783">I have a gift for you.</string>
  <string id="6125784">Here. This might set your mind at ease.</string>
  <string id="6125787">Well, if you're really worried about the templars, have I got a deal for you...</string>
  <string id="6125790">There's something I want you to have.</string>
  <string id="6125793">What is it?</string>
  <string id="6125796">This key opens the cellars below the house here. You can get in from Darktown... if you ever need a quick escape.</string>
  <string id="6125799">Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6125802">Every time I think you don't understand, you turn around and do something like this.</string>
  <string id="6125805">It still surprises me how much you risk for my sake.</string>
  <string id="6125808">I will keep it close.</string>
  <string id="6125815">Don't worry about me.</string>
  <string id="6125816">I'll be fine.</string>
  <string id="6125817">I'm more concerned about you.</string>
  <string id="6125818">Don't worry about me.</string>
  <string id="6125819">I don't think we're at the point of having to worry about private conversations in our home, do you?</string>
  <string id="6125820">Things aren't that bad yet.</string>
  <string id="6125821">We do. They're watching.</string>
  <string id="6125824">She's a blood mage. Can you blame them for going after her?</string>
  <string id="6125825">The templars should hunt her.</string>
  <string id="6125826">I will never understand how you can be so antagonistic by day and so passionate by night.</string>
  <string id="6125829">You'll understand when it's me Meredith is coming for.</string>
  <string id="6125832">You won't be able to sit by so righteously.</string>
  <string id="6125833">Will we never be able to stop worrying about the blighted templars?</string>
  <string id="6125834">Damned templars!</string>
  <string id="6125835">As long as there's one templar in Thedas, mages will not be safe.</string>
  <string id="6125838">It means more than I can say to have had a partner these past three years.</string>
  <string id="6125841">It makes me believe we can do anything.</string>
  <string id="6125842">I love you.</string>
  <string id="6125843">I will always be here for you.</string>
  <string id="6125844">There will be war soon. The mages left in Kirkwall are at the breaking point.</string>
  <string id="6125847">I wish I could promise to keep you safe.</string>
  <string id="6125848">Merrill's gone now. Is this the best you can think to do?</string>
  <string id="6125849">Let's do something more fun.</string>
  <string id="6125851">The city is out of control. It will be open war soon.</string>
  <string id="6125852">War is coming.</string>
  <string id="6125853">Would that it had come sooner.</string>
  <string id="6125856">Meredith's rule has decimated the mage underground.</string>
  <string id="6125859">It would take the Maker's own aid to help us win now.</string>
  <string id="6125868">I think we're better off focusing on the task at hand.</string>
  <string id="6125875">I'll find you as soon as I'm done.</string>
  <string id="6125881">Just talk to the grand cleric. I'll only be a moment.</string>
  <string id="6125885">Thank you. I wouldn't have asked just anyone to venture in there for me.</string>
  <string id="6125888">There is one more thing, but we must discuss it privately.</string>
  <string id="6125893">Sorry to drag you down here.</string>
  <string id="6125897">We still need the drakestone from the Bone Pit.</string>
  <string id="6125903">I know it isn't my place to criticize, but...</string>
  <string id="6125906">Are you sure about Merrill?</string>
  <string id="6125909">She acts sweet, but she'll never pick you over her demon.</string>
  <string id="6125910">Merrill loves me.</string>
  <string id="6125911">We're happy.</string>
  <string id="6125915">What right do you have to question us? Is your Justice any different?</string>
  <string id="6125918">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6125921">Keep your illusions, then. Maker knows I won't be the one to change them.</string>
  <string id="6125922">Are you sure about Fenris?</string>
  <string id="6125925">He seems less a man to me than a wild dog.</string>
  <string id="6125926">You just don't know him.</string>
  <string id="6125927">Don't call him that.</string>
  <string id="6125928">I know as much as I'm ever likely to.</string>
  <string id="6125931">That's right, mage.</string>
  <string id="6125934">He has let one bad experience color his whole world. Surely, you want someone more open-minded.</string>
  <string id="6125937">A mage and a hypocrite. What company you keep.</string>
  <string id="6125939">We're not together. Not anymore.</string>
  <string id="6125940">He left me.</string>
  <string id="6125941">Oh. I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6125944">Though Isabela seems more than willing to help you forget the loss.</string>
  <string id="6125947">Was that you outside the door? I knew someone was listening!</string>
  <string id="6125948">Though it's probably for the best.</string>
  <string id="6125949">You're right. This isn't your place.</string>
  <string id="6125950">I don't want to talk about it.</string>
  <string id="6125955">They should rename this stuff dragon dung.</string>
  <string id="6125959">We still need the sela petrae from the sewers.</string>
  <string id="6125965">I hope the rest of the dragons haven't heard this place is on the market.</string>
  <string id="6125970">We'll need to visit the Bone Pit for the drakestone and the sewers to collect the sela petrae.</string>
  <string id="6125977">The grand cleric cannot continue to wave her hands and pretend the problem is solved. She's as good as helping Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6125978">Even the templars are turning on Meredith. That I never thought I'd see.</string>
  <string id="6125981">I wonder if they'd fight her directly if put to the test?</string>
  <string id="6125982">Meredith wants to convince you all mages are abominations waiting to happen.</string>
  <string id="6125985">But far more are like Emile.</string>
  <string id="6125989">I don't know which is worse, the rats or the people.</string>
  <string id="6125990">The people here, they never leave Hightown's fancy walls. They have no idea what's brewing below them.</string>
  <string id="6125991">So pious, aren't they? So ready to believe that any harm they do is the will of the Maker.</string>
  <string id="6125992">Half of Ferelden is packed into this stinking place. They'd have done better to fight the darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6125993">No wonder they call this the Dragon Age. The bloody things are everywhere.</string>
  <string id="6125994">It's nice to get some fresh air. Kirkwall starts to stink after a bit.</string>
  <string id="6125995">Why don't you trust me?</string>
  <string id="6126001">The templars have ears everywhere. We shouldn't talk here.</string>
  <string id="6126308">I know I make stupid mistakes, and I babble like a fool, and you... you're beautiful and clever.</string>
  <string id="6126311">You're too good. You shouldn't have to waste your time trying to save me from my own folly.</string>
  <string id="6126313">You're worth it.</string>
  <string id="6126314">I don't mind playing the hero for you.</string>
  <string id="6126315">I care for you, Merrill. I want to be there for you.</string>
  <string id="6126316">But what if I just enjoy being your protector?</string>
  <string id="6126318">I can't let you hurt anyone.</string>
  <string id="6126322">Invest in the expedition. Fifty sovereigns, and he can't refuse. Not with me there to vouch for you.</string>
  <string id="6126323">Invest in the expedition. A hundred and fifty sovereigns, and he can't refuse. Not with me there to vouch for you.</string>
  <string id="6126324">Invest in the expedition. Two hundred and fifty sovereigns, and he can't refuse. Not with me there to vouch for you.</string>
  <string id="6126338">Let's just hope our dear old uncle is as good as his word.</string>
  <string id="6126342">Wait.</string>
  <string id="6126348">Here I am, about to defend these mages in hopeless battle.</string>
  <string id="6126351">You lead me to strange places, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6126352">I'll take you to stranger places than this, just watch.</string>
  <string id="6126353">I'll lead you to more.</string>
  <string id="6126354">A tempting offer.</string>
  <string id="6126357">I expect you to fight to the best of your ability.</string>
  <string id="6126358">You're here now.</string>
  <string id="6126359">Of course. There is no turning back.</string>
  <string id="6126362">Sometimes you have to do the right thing.</string>
  <string id="6126363">We have no choice.</string>
  <string id="6126364">I'll take your word on that.</string>
  <string id="6126367">This isn't so strange, really. What's one more life-or-death battle?</string>
  <string id="6126368">That's what I do best.</string>
  <string id="6126369">Chuckles An excellent point.</string>
  <string id="6126372">I hope you're prepared for what we're about to face.</string>
  <string id="6126375">Desperation will drive these mages to terrible acts. I have seen it before. It will not be pretty.</string>
  <string id="6126376">What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="6126377">You've seen it before?</string>
  <string id="6126378">The Imperium has its own templars, and they too must act when mages cross the line.</string>
  <string id="6126381">The line is in a different place, but the end result is the same.</string>
  <string id="6126384">We will see abominations born of terror and wrath, men you never believed capable of depravity embracing it gladly.</string>
  <string id="6126385">We can't simply sit back and watch.</string>
  <string id="6126386">Something has to be done.</string>
  <string id="6126387">And we aren't.</string>
  <string id="6126390">I don't think it's too late. It doesn't have to go that far.</string>
  <string id="6126391">We can still help them.</string>
  <string id="6126392">We shall see.</string>
  <string id="6126395">Abominations and blood mages? Sounds like a Tuesday.</string>
  <string id="6126396">Sounds like fun.</string>
  <string id="6126397">Chuckles It does sound that way, doesn't it?</string>
  <string id="6126400">I... may not get the chance to say this again.</string>
  <string id="6126403">Meeting you was the most important thing that ever happened to me, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6126406">Promise me you won't die. I can't bear the thought of living without you.</string>
  <string id="6126407">I don't plan on dying.</string>
  <string id="6126408">You won't have to.</string>
  <string id="6126409">You'd better not.</string>
  <string id="6126412">I don't make that promise unless you do.</string>
  <string id="6126413">I feel the same.</string>
  <string id="6126414">Nothing is going to keep me from you.</string>
  <string id="6126417">I didn't quite catch that. Could you speak up?</string>
  <string id="6126418">What are you saying?</string>
  <string id="6126419">Then let me make it clearer for you.</string>
  <string id="6126425">Then let me say one more thing, in case it's the last.</string>
  <string id="6126428">You're a good friend. The only one I've ever had. It will be an honor to fight at your side.</string>
  <string id="6126431">Meeting you was the only good fortune I've ever had. It will be a privilege fighting at your side.</string>
  <string id="6126434">Now the battle awaits us.</string>
  <string id="6126437">Na via lerno victoria. Only the living know victory. Fight well.</string>
  <string id="6126438">The battle awaits us, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6126444">I've... heard about the Circle of Magi outside of the Imperium, but I've never been in one.</string>
  <string id="6126447">Are you certain it's wise for you to be here?</string>
  <string id="6126448">Oh, I'm sure nobody will notice little old me, don't you worry.</string>
  <string id="6126449">I'll blend in.</string>
  <string id="6126450">Very reassuring.</string>
  <string id="6126453">Are you certain it's wise for us to come here? Considering... who we're with.</string>
  <string id="6126454">It would help if you didn't ask questions like that.</string>
  <string id="6126455">Not if you don't stay quiet.</string>
  <string id="6126456">I could throw a fireball or two. Maybe that would help.</string>
  <string id="6126459">Probably not.</string>
  <string id="6126462">Yes, why don't you just wave a sign over our heads?</string>
  <string id="6126465">Maybe not, but we'll be cautious.</string>
  <string id="6126466">We'll be careful.</string>
  <string id="6126467">I don't think the templars will be surprised to see another mage here, do you?</string>
  <string id="6126468">What's one more mage?</string>
  <string id="6126469">Hmm. Maybe not.</string>
  <string id="6126472">I'll try to look sufficiently meek and oppressed.</string>
  <string id="6126475">Are there many Dalish here?</string>
  <string id="6126478">I'll try to avoid setting the place on fire. It'll be hard.</string>
  <string id="6126481">You're not helping.</string>
  <string id="6126484">This seems more like a prison. I wonder if it's more effective than the Circle I know.</string>
  <string id="6126485">How is the Imperial Circle of Magi different?</string>
  <string id="6126486">What is it like in Tevinter?</string>
  <string id="6126487">Once upon a time it was as it is here. The Chantry watched the magisters closely for any signs of corruption or weakness.</string>
  <string id="6126490">Then it changed. The magisters were permitted to watch over their own, and templars kept only to enforce the law.</string>
  <string id="6126493">What happened next was inevitable. The magisters rule again, as powerful as they ever were.</string>
  <string id="6126494">You said the Chantry used to watch the magisters. Why did they stop?</string>
  <string id="6126495">Why did it change?</string>
  <string id="6126496">You must remember that the attitude towards magic is different in Tevinter.</string>
  <string id="6126499">Magisters came from wealthy families, bloodlines that had nurtured magical talent for countless generations.</string>
  <string id="6126502">The Chantry was not trying to control poor peasants but the scions of the greatest houses in the Imperium.</string>
  <string id="6126503">I thought the magisters had been thrown down by the Chantry.</string>
  <string id="6126504">Weren't they defeated?</string>
  <string id="6126505">On the contrary, Andraste never defeated the Imperium. Her great army conquered the south, but not the north.</string>
  <string id="6126508">The magisters eventually surrendered to the Chantry, but they did so on their terms. They kept their influence.</string>
  <string id="6126511">Thus they reclaimed what they lost over the centuries. Some battles are lost by inches.</string>
  <string id="6126512">You're saying the same thing could happen here.</string>
  <string id="6126513">How is it inevitable?</string>
  <string id="6126514">If the mages were permitted to be their own watchers? Of course.</string>
  <string id="6126517">It is too easy for a mage to resort to blood magic if they feel the need is great enough.</string>
  <string id="6126520">A mage can desire power, justice, revenge, protection... any cause will do, and then they are lost.</string>
  <string id="6126521">You can't say every mage is corrupt.</string>
  <string id="6126522">Not all mages do that.</string>
  <string id="6126523">The ones that are lost should be dealt with.</string>
  <string id="6126524">Then they should be punished.</string>
  <string id="6126525">That is the question, isn't it? Who should deal with them?</string>
  <string id="6126528">You're saying that locking mages up is better?</string>
  <string id="6126529">So this is the answer?</string>
  <string id="6126530">All I am saying is the Imperium offers no answer. All that Andraste did long ago to end the tyranny of magic has been undone.</string>
  <string id="6126533">She ended the tyranny of magic and replaced it with an entirely new one.</string>
  <string id="6126536">Considering all that magic has done to my homeland and my race I weep for your predicament.</string>
  <string id="6126539">Tyranny of magic? Very dramatic.</string>
  <string id="6126542">Let me show you my homeland, or the ruins of Arlathan, and then you may speak of drama.</string>
  <string id="6126545">She freed our people as well, but it was your Chantry that undid that.</string>
  <string id="6126548">And who enslaved us in the first place? Don't be naive.</string>
  <string id="6126551">Power corrupts, as they say, and mages have power enough already.</string>
  <string id="6126552">You talk about the magisters as if they are all evil.</string>
  <string id="6126553">Are the magisters so terrible?</string>
  <string id="6126554">I have no doubt that some are good and noble men, strong enough to resist temptation.</string>
  <string id="6126557">But how many temptations do you wish to offer a man before he will give in?</string>
  <string id="6126560">Blood magic is everywhere in Tevinter. From the lowliest apprentice up to the archon himself.</string>
  <string id="6126561">You can't have seen this for yourself.</string>
  <string id="6126562">How do you know that?</string>
  <string id="6126563">Hmph. Danarius talked about it often.</string>
  <string id="6126566">Of course they say it's forbidden. Behind the smiles and closed doors, however, it's a different matter.</string>
  <string id="6126569">To be a magister in Tevinter is to be glorious. To be a powerful magister in Tevinter... that is worth any price.</string>
  <string id="6126571">It's wrong to oppress mages.</string>
  <string id="6126572">The templars here abuse their power. They go too far.</string>
  <string id="6126575">Does that mean they should not try?</string>
  <string id="6126578">Maybe it means they shouldn't be the ones to watch us.</string>
  <string id="6126581">Treating every mage like a criminal isn't the answer.</string>
  <string id="6126584">And not every mage deserves the benefit of the doubt.</string>
  <string id="6126587">And I suppose you decide which ones?</string>
  <string id="6126593">Injustice cannot be answered with injustice.</string>
  <string id="6126599">I think you need to be quiet now.</string>
  <string id="6126602">What the Circle does here is better than the alternative.</string>
  <string id="6126603">The Circle is necessary.</string>
  <string id="6126604">An alternative I am very familiar with.</string>
  <string id="6126607">Alternatives are so wonderful for those who have choices.</string>
  <string id="6126610">Herding mages together and putting them under lock and key? It can't be the answer.</string>
  <string id="6126616">According to everything I've seen, the Circle can't control mages anyhow.</string>
  <string id="6126617">The Circle doesn't work.</string>
  <string id="6126618">And what is the alternative?</string>
  <string id="6126621">Freedom is a noble ideal, but I see no oppression here. I see fear... and danger.</string>
  <string id="6126624">But enough. I'm sure we came here for a reason.</string>
  <string id="6126633">You know, you could go anywhere you like, now.</string>
  <string id="6126636">I'm aware of that.</string>
  <string id="6126639">Oh! You could become a raider! You could join my crew!</string>
  <string id="6126642">The crew of your non-existent ship?</string>
  <string id="6126645">Well, with that attitude you're never going anywhere, are you?</string>
  <string id="6126651">She doesn't understand.</string>
  <string id="6126657">You don't need to stay in this pit anymore, you know. Not that you haven't, er, fixed it up nicely.</string>
  <string id="6126660">It's falling apart, and my ability to keep the seneschal from noticing is nearing an end.</string>
  <string id="6126663">I appreciate what you've done, Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6126666">But you're staying. You could go anywhere now!</string>
  <string id="6126669">Perhaps I don't wish to go anywhere.</string>
  <string id="6126675">Freedom must be a terrible burden, I guess.</string>
  <string id="6126678">They don't understand.</string>
  <string id="6126681">Yes, I am free. Danarius is dead. Yet... it doesn't feel like it should.</string>
  <string id="6126682">You wanted him to stop chasing you. Now he has.</string>
  <string id="6126683">Get over it.</string>
  <string id="6126684">You thought killing him would solve everything, but it doesn't.</string>
  <string id="6126685">Revenge wasn't the answer.</string>
  <string id="6126686">I suppose not.</string>
  <string id="6126689">Seems like you should be dancing for joy.</string>
  <string id="6126690">You aren't happy?</string>
  <string id="6126691">I would have thought so.</string>
  <string id="6126694">I thought if I didn't need to run and fight to stay alive, I would finally be able to live as a free man does.</string>
  <string id="6126697">But how is that? Whatever past I had died with my sister. I have nothing now—not even an enemy.</string>
  <string id="6126698">But how is that? My sister is gone, and I have nothing—not even an enemy.</string>
  <string id="6126699">Is that all you do? Dwell on the negative?</string>
  <string id="6126700">You're whining.</string>
  <string id="6126701">No, I... well, all right, yes. Fair enough.</string>
  <string id="6126704">Maybe that just means there's nothing holding you back.</string>
  <string id="6126705">You have a future.</string>
  <string id="6126706">Hmm. An interesting thought.</string>
  <string id="6126709">You're not reminiscing about the good old days of being hunted, I hope.</string>
  <string id="6126710">You miss Danarius?</string>
  <string id="6126711">I wouldn't go that far.</string>
  <string id="6126714">It's just... difficult to overlook the stain that magic has left on my life. If I seem bitter, it's not without cause.</string>
  <string id="6126717">Perhaps it is time to move forward. I just don't know where that leads. Do you?</string>
  <string id="6126718">You're still blaming magic for everything?</string>
  <string id="6126719">You think magic is at fault?</string>
  <string id="6126720">Think about it, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6126723">Look at what happened to your mother. Look at the life you've had to lead.</string>
  <string id="6126726">Look at what happened to your mother... your sister... so many others.</string>
  <string id="6126729">Is there anyone whose life has been touched by magic that actually benefits?</string>
  <string id="6126730">You make a good point.</string>
  <string id="6126731">Maybe you're right.</string>
  <string id="6126734">Blaming magic isn't the answer.</string>
  <string id="6126735">It isn't that simple.</string>
  <string id="6126736">For every mage such as you, Hawke, there are a dozen more too weak to handle their power.</string>
  <string id="6126739">There are problems enough in this world without putting such power in the hands of those too weak to resist its allure.</string>
  <string id="6126742">Them, I fear, as should you. As should anyone.</string>
  <string id="6126745">But what's important now is moving forward. I only wish I knew where that led.</string>
  <string id="6126746">Wherever it leads, I hope it means we'll stay together.</string>
  <string id="6126747">Stay with me.</string>
  <string id="6126748">That is my hope, as well.</string>
  <string id="6126751">Nobody knows the future, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6126752">Does anyone?</string>
  <string id="6126753">You do what you want, it doesn't matter to me.</string>
  <string id="6126754">I don't care.</string>
  <string id="6126755">Ah. And here I'd hoped it might.</string>
  <string id="6126758">I'd hoped it might. I've always thought of you as a friend.</string>
  <string id="6126761">Fair enough, Hawke. I suppose I'll need to find out for myself... like anyone else, yes?</string>
  <string id="6126765">There's so many possibilities.</string>
  <string id="6126766">It can lead anywhere you want, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6126769">That's the point, isn't it? You can do anything you like.</string>
  <string id="6126772">You want the answer right now? That would spoil all the fun!</string>
  <string id="6126775">The future of a slave is never uncertain. But I am no longer a slave. Perhaps it is time I remembered that.</string>
  <string id="6126778">Thank you, Hawke. I would never have thought to call a mage my friend, yet here you are.</string>
  <string id="6126781">Thank you, Hawke. Of all the things I thought to find here, a friend was not one of them.</string>
  <string id="6126784">Wherever the future leads, I hope it is at your side.</string>
  <string id="6126793">Festis bei umo canavarum.</string>
  <string id="6126794">Let me guess. You're upset. Again.</string>
  <string id="6126795">What's wrong now?</string>
  <string id="6126796">Am I supposed to understand that?</string>
  <string id="6126797">What?</string>
  <string id="6126798">No need to go overboard with the thanks or anything.</string>
  <string id="6126799">You're welcome.</string>
  <string id="6126800">It means, you will be the death of me.</string>
  <string id="6126803">Six years ago I decided to stay with you, in part because I owed you. But I also thought you could help me.</string>
  <string id="6126806">And you did. Hadriana is dead. Danarius is dead. I am finally free.</string>
  <string id="6126809">But none of it feels like it should. This freedom tastes like ashes.</string>
  <string id="6126810">I didn't tell you to do any of this.</string>
  <string id="6126811">How is that my fault?</string>
  <string id="6126812">And yet you led me, each step of the way.</string>
  <string id="6126815">You were already free, Fenris. Killing Danarius was just revenge.</string>
  <string id="6126816">This isn't freedom.</string>
  <string id="6126817">Ah, yes. Platitudes are so easy.</string>
  <string id="6126820">I always thought it tasted like chicken.</string>
  <string id="6126821">Try it with salt.</string>
  <string id="6126822">Yes, joke. That's your answer for everything, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6126825">Sighs You are not responsible for my misery. Why am I angry at you?</string>
  <string id="6126828">I thought finding Varania would open up a new world, one that was lost forever. But it's gone and I can't get it back.</string>
  <string id="6126831">What do I do now, Hawke?</string>
  <string id="6126832">We're not exactly friends, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6126833">You're asking me?</string>
  <string id="6126834">Yet I respect you.</string>
  <string id="6126837">Clearly you're doing something right. Perhaps you can see what I cannot.</string>
  <string id="6126839">Start over.</string>
  <string id="6126840">Stop waiting for your past.</string>
  <string id="6126843">You have a whole future to decide that.</string>
  <string id="6126846">Sounds like the perfect time to do something new.</string>
  <string id="6126852">You're obviously not happy here.</string>
  <string id="6126853">You should leave.</string>
  <string id="6126854">Obviously not.</string>
  <string id="6126857">There are other lands I haven't seen, places with no bad memories. Perhaps I shall go west.</string>
  <string id="6126860">For what it's worth, Hawke... thank you.</string>
  <string id="6126864">It's not up to me.</string>
  <string id="6126865">You're asking the wrong person.</string>
  <string id="6126868">What do you want to do?</string>
  <string id="6126871">Chuckles Clearly making decisions for myself isn't my best quality.</string>
  <string id="6126874">Change your clothes, join the Chantry, I don't know.</string>
  <string id="6126877">Laughs I don't think I'll go that far.</string>
  <string id="6126880">Maybe it is time to leave this hatred behind. It's poison, yet I continue to swallow it.</string>
  <string id="6126883">There is no one left to blame. What I have done I have done to myself.</string>
  <string id="6126884">You don't have to go through this alone.</string>
  <string id="6126885">I can help you.</string>
  <string id="6126886">Don't I?</string>
  <string id="6126889">It's about time you realized that.</string>
  <string id="6126890">Seems that way.</string>
  <string id="6126891">Laughs Been waiting, have you?</string>
  <string id="6126894">What you're going through can't be easy.</string>
  <string id="6126895">You're too hard on yourself.</string>
  <string id="6126896">You are too kind.</string>
  <string id="6126899">Danarius isn't exactly blameless.</string>
  <string id="6126900">You had help.</string>
  <string id="6126901">Perhaps. But he's dead, now.</string>
  <string id="6126910">We have never discussed what happened between us three years ago.</string>
  <string id="6126913">You didn't want to talk about it.</string>
  <string id="6126916">I felt like a fool. I thought it better if you hated me—I deserved no less.</string>
  <string id="6126919">But it isn't better. That night... I remember your touch as if it were yesterday.</string>
  <string id="6126922">I should have asked your forgiveness long ago. I hope you can forgive me now.</string>
  <string id="6126923">I need to understand why you left, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6126924">Tell me why.</string>
  <string id="6126925">I've thought about the answer a thousand times.</string>
  <string id="6126928">The pain, the memories it brought up... it was too much. I was a coward.</string>
  <string id="6126931">If I could go back, I would stay. Tell you how I felt.</string>
  <string id="6126932">What would you have said?</string>
  <string id="6126933">Which is?</string>
  <string id="6126934">Nothing could be worse than the thought of living without you.</string>
  <string id="6126936">You're forgiven.</string>
  <string id="6126937">Don't let it happen again.</string>
  <string id="6126940">I understand. I always understood.</string>
  <string id="6126943">Oh, I don't know. This might be fun to hold over you a while longer.</string>
  <string id="6126946">If there is a future to be had, I will walk into it gladly at your side.</string>
  <string id="6126952">Whatever happened, it was a long time ago.</string>
  <string id="6126953">It's too late.</string>
  <string id="6126954">I had to ask.</string>
  <string id="6126957">Then I hope we can remain friends. That is something I have always valued.</string>
  <string id="6126960">If I have been difficult...  I'm sorry. Clearly I owe you more than I believed.</string>
  <string id="6126966">Take a look at this.</string>
  <string id="6126969">A blade of mercy? I remember these.</string>
  <string id="6126972">You see them in the Imperium: replicas of the sword Archon Hessarian used to kill Andraste. This one looks finely crafted.</string>
  <string id="6126973">It seems like a regular sword.</string>
  <string id="6126974">Finely crafted? </string>
  <string id="6126975">I thought it might be worth something.</string>
  <string id="6126976">So it's not valuable.</string>
  <string id="6126977">It is.</string>
  <string id="6126980">So they sell these things at every market stand in Minrathous?</string>
  <string id="6126981">It's a souvenir?</string>
  <string id="6126982">Laughs Hardly.</string>
  <string id="6126985">Here, let me show you.</string>
  <string id="6126988">These are gifts of honor, given to those who have performed a service for the Imperium. Danarius coveted them, as I recall.</string>
  <string id="6126989">You don't talk about the Imperium much.</string>
  <string id="6126990">Tell me about Tevinter.</string>
  <string id="6126991">It's not a place I remember fondly.</string>
  <string id="6126992">Doesn't the Chantry forbid mages to rule over men?</string>
  <string id="6126993">Tevinter is ruled by mages?</string>
  <string id="6126994">Ah, yes. Magic is meant to serve man, and not rule over him.</string>
  <string id="6126997">In the Imperium they say that means magic should serve the greater good, which they claim the magisters do.</string>
  <string id="6127000">Do not believe it.</string>
  <string id="6127001">What do the magisters do that's so bad?</string>
  <string id="6127002">Why is that?</string>
  <string id="6127003">What you call the Circle of Magi rules the Imperium. They control the Chantry, as well as the templars.</string>
  <string id="6127006">They claim the magisters are governed by holy law, but they are the law.</string>
  <string id="6127009">They do as they please. All of them.</string>
  <string id="6127010">So they all use forbidden magic?</string>
  <string id="6127011">Are they blood mages?</string>
  <string id="6127012">The more powerful the mage, the higher he rises in the Senate. He makes the laws, he determines what is acceptable.</string>
  <string id="6127015">Everyone who wishes to compete must do the same, or be crushed.</string>
  <string id="6127018">Perhaps it wasn't always this way, but it is now.</string>
  <string id="6127019">I heard that the Imperium has been at war with the Qunari for decades.</string>
  <string id="6127020">Tevinter's at war with Qunari?</string>
  <string id="6127021">Ever since the Qunari landed on the island of Seheron, yes. Eighty years ago? Perhaps more.</string>
  <string id="6127024">The archon demanded aid from the rest of Thedas. It didn't get him far.</string>
  <string id="6127025">They've been at war a long time.</string>
  <string id="6127026">But who's winning?</string>
  <string id="6127027">The Qunari only ever wanted Seheron, which they have.</string>
  <string id="6127030">The Imperium has made numerous attempts to retake the island, without real success.</string>
  <string id="6127033">I believe the Qunari are saving their strength, building a massive fleet. When they wish true war, we will know.</string>
  <string id="6127034">Are the Qunari that strong?</string>
  <string id="6127035">You think they'll win?</string>
  <string id="6127036">They once fought all the lands of Thedas to a stand-still. If they wanted to conquer the Imperium, they would.</string>
  <string id="6127039">From what I saw on Seheron, they will not relent. They believe even more strongly than the magisters that they are in the right.</string>
  <string id="6127040">The slave trade is still in operation in the Imperium?</string>
  <string id="6127041">Slavery is legal in Tevinter?</string>
  <string id="6127042">It varies from one archon to the next. One outlawed it many years ago—he was quickly assassinated.</string>
  <string id="6127045">Tevinter would crumble without slaves. The Imperium's elite know no other way.</string>
  <string id="6127046">Seems like a slave rebellion would end that.</string>
  <string id="6127047">Don't they rise up?</string>
  <string id="6127048">There are rebellions all the time, actually.</string>
  <string id="6127051">Most of them end... poorly. The Senate always unites when faced with sedition.</string>
  <string id="6127054">One day things will change. Then the magisters will see just how fragile their hold is.</string>
  <string id="6127056">Keep the sword.</string>
  <string id="6127057">The blade is yours.</string>
  <string id="6127060">I'd like you to have it.</string>
  <string id="6127063">The blade is yours, if you want it.</string>
  <string id="6127066">For me? Yes... I think I'd like that. I'll think of the irony as I wield it.</string>
  <string id="6127069">Thank you, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6127072">You think I wish to carry a symbol of Imperial honor? You must be joking.</string>
  <string id="6127075">Keep your sword. Sell it, melt it down. I want nothing to do with its filthy magic.</string>
  <string id="6127078">This could come in handy.</string>
  <string id="6127079">I'll keep the blade.</string>
  <string id="6127080">Without a doubt. I certainly don't want anything to do with it.</string>
  <string id="6127086">I have something for you.</string>
  <string id="6127089">It... it's a book.</string>
  <string id="6127090">This one is quite rare, actually.</string>
  <string id="6127091">It's no ordinary book.</string>
  <string id="6127092">It's a subject you're familiar with.</string>
  <string id="6127093">I thought you might enjoy it.</string>
  <string id="6127094">I see your eyesight is still working fine.</string>
  <string id="6127095">Of course it's a book.</string>
  <string id="6127096">The book is by Shartan, the elf who helped Andraste free the slaves. You know about him, right?</string>
  <string id="6127099">A little. It's just...</string>
  <string id="6127102">Slaves are not permitted to read. I've never learned.</string>
  <string id="6127103">Of course I know about him. What do you take me for?</string>
  <string id="6127106">I certainly didn't learn from books, though. Do you think they teach slaves to read?</string>
  <string id="6127107">You haven't been a slave for years.</string>
  <string id="6127108">Why haven't you learned?</string>
  <string id="6127109">I suppose that's true.</string>
  <string id="6127112">And? Am I not learning your ways quickly enough to suit you?</string>
  <string id="6127115">It's not too late to learn, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6127116">I could teach you.</string>
  <string id="6127117">Isn't it? Sometimes I wonder.</string>
  <string id="6127120">Is that what this is? Let's teach the poor slave to read?</string>
  <string id="6127123">A simple thank you would have sufficed.</string>
  <string id="6127124">Do they teach manners?</string>
  <string id="6127125">Chuckles Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6127128">I don't mean to seem ungrateful. I do appreciate the thought.</string>
  <string id="6127131">Yes. Thank you for reminding me of something I can never do.</string>
  <string id="6127134">Growls Ignore me. You are not responsible for my deficiencies. I do appreciate your gift.</string>
  <string id="6127137">I've always wanted to learn more of Shartan. Perhaps this is my chance.</string>
  <string id="6127143">I never thought I would find myself begging to be allowed back into Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6127147">I hope we can get into the city soon. I don't know what will happen if we have to go elsewhere.</string>
  <string id="6127166">Friends in Low Places</string>
  <string id="6127167">I understand you're in dire need of some coin. If that's true, I believe I have a proposition that you simply will not be able to refuse. Look for me at night near the foundries in Lowtown.&#13;
&#13;
—Dougal</string>
  <string id="6127168">Meet Dougal near the foundries in Lowtown at night.</string>
  <string id="6127170">I'm sorry, love. I was... distraught. I never really believed that. It's just...</string>
  <string id="6127173">The darkspawn would have been happy with any prey. It was my fault it was Bethany.</string>
  <string id="6127176">The ogre would have been happy with any prey. It was my fault it was Carver.</string>
  <string id="6127179">I-I miss him.</string>
  <string id="6127182">There were four of us when the Blight began. It will never be over while there are just three.</string>
  <string id="6127186">The estate is yours. Why are we still here?</string>
  <string id="6127187">Can we move to the estate now?</string>
  <string id="6127188">Technically, the house is now property of the viscount, since its owner died without an heir.</string>
  <string id="6127191">If we went there now, we would just be squatters.</string>
  <string id="6127194">But if the viscount acknowledges our rights, we can get back more than the house. We can get back our name.</string>
  <string id="6127197">I've got something for you.</string>
  <string id="6127204">Ooh. Did you get this from Master Ilen?</string>
  <string id="6127207">It looks like his work. He's always carving halla out of bits of scrap.</string>
  <string id="6127210">Before we left Ferelden, he had so many the Keeper said he'd need ten real halla to pull his carved ones north.</string>
  <string id="6127211">It's beautiful. Just like the real thing.</string>
  <string id="6127214">Mythal! Did I miss some important occasion? I'm so sorry! I'll make it up to you, I promise!</string>
  <string id="6127215">Your mother never hated you.</string>
  <string id="6127216">Grandmother's not worth this.</string>
  <string id="6127217">Your mom was a bitch.</string>
  <string id="6127220">That doesn't sound healthy.</string>
  <string id="6127221">He's obsessed.</string>
  <string id="6127222">Feeling homesick?</string>
  <string id="6127223">You sound sad.</string>
  <string id="6127224">Is having a weird fixation a Dalish thing, or specific just to your clan?</string>
  <string id="6127225">Are all elves crazy?</string>
  <string id="6127228">It's just a gift. Nothing to panic over.</string>
  <string id="6127229">Calm down.</string>
  <string id="6127230">There's no occasion, Merrill. I just thought you'd like it.</string>
  <string id="6127231">You didn't forget anything.</string>
  <string id="6127232">I think I missed the elvish sign for, This present induces terrible guilt. I'll shop more carefully in the future.</string>
  <string id="6127233">Did I give you the wrong gift?</string>
  <string id="6127237">I thought you were leaving.</string>
  <string id="6127240">I... I am.</string>
  <string id="6127243">You've spit on Tamlen's memory. On Mahariel's.</string>
  <string id="6127244">Then go. Or do you take some sick pleasure in drawing this out?</string>
  <string id="6127250">You've spit on Tamlen's memory. Do you think the clan will just forgive that?</string>
  <string id="6127255">Everything will be all right.</string>
  <string id="6127257">I feel like I'm forgetting something. Or there's more to do. Or...</string>
  <string id="6127260">A deal has been made with Dougal. Tell Bartrand that the 50 sovereigns will be delivered to him.</string>
  <string id="6127261">Dougal's deal has been refused. He said he would stay around the foundry area for a little while longer, just in case.</string>
  <string id="6127267">I'm with you, ma vhenan.</string>
  <string id="6127268">Bartrand has been paid without Dougal's help. Chances are Dougal has moved on by now.</string>
  <string id="6127271">I suppose whether we succeed or fail doesn't really matter.</string>
  <string id="6127272">I hope so. I'm... I'm sure this is for the best.</string>
  <string id="6127275">It's not a pretty home, but at least it's clean.</string>
  <string id="6127276">This is it, then.</string>
  <string id="6127279">I can't believe I'm actually... helping templars.</string>
  <string id="6127280">I didn't think... I only ever wanted to help the Dalish. Never a thought for any other people's troubles...</string>
  <string id="6127294">What happens now?</string>
  <string id="6127298">Looks like the Amells didn't hate Father enough to throw all his possessions away.</string>
  <string id="6127301">There's a letter. A mage called Tobrius says a mutual friend died. Might be worth checking after this is done.</string>
  <string id="6127302">The Hanged Man</string>
  <string id="6127303">Whoever Dougal was, it's unlikely he's in Lowtown any longer.</string>
  <string id="6127306">Right. I knew that.</string>
  <string id="6127309">That's very kind of you to say.</string>
  <string id="6127310">Looks like the Amells didn't hate Father enough to throw all his possessions away.</string>
  <string id="6127313">Looks like the Amells didn't hate your father enough to throw all his possessions away.</string>
  <string id="6127316">The Amells kept this remnant of your father? That's unexpected.</string>
  <string id="6127319">Looks like the Amells didn't hate your father enough to throw  all his possessions away.</string>
  <string id="6127322">The in-laws kept your father's things? I'd have sold that straight away.</string>
  <string id="6127325">Looks like the Amells didn't hate your father enough to throw all his possessions away.</string>

  <string id="6127364">Carver will be most surprised to learn of his namesake. Speak with him about this.</string>
  <string id="6127365">Carver was not sure what to make of this gift, but it's a connection to Kirkwall he wasn't aware of.</string>

  <string id="6127400">My mother has been taken by the Kirkwall killer.</string>
  <string id="6127403">What? Are you certain?</string>
  <string id="6127404">This is my mother we're talking about. I want something done.</string>
  <string id="6127405">Don't question me.</string>
  <string id="6127406">No, I just came here because I had nothing better to do.</string>
  <string id="6127407">Of course not.</string>
  <string id="6127408">I apologize. I didn't expect him to strike so soon.</string>
  <string id="6127409">My mother received white flowers this morning. I believe the killer sends these to his victims.</string>
  <string id="6127410">There were flowers.</string>
  <string id="6127411">That's not much to go on, but I won't dismiss your suspicions. I did that with Emeric, and look where he turned up.</string>
  <string id="6127414">You said you'd look into this after I told you about Emeric's death. Did you learn anything?</string>
  <string id="6127415">What about your investigation?</string>
  <string id="6127416">I'm afraid not, serah.</string>
  <string id="6127422">Whatever happens, I'm with you, ma vhenan.</string>
  <string id="6127426">So do we proceed with the original plan, or keep looking?</string>
  <string id="6127429">Back Alley</string>
  <string id="6127430">It's good that you can stay with me. I need you, Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6127431">I'm glad I won't lose you.</string>
  <string id="6127432">You've been grand through all of this. A true friend.</string>
  <string id="6127436">Docks</string>
  <string id="6127437">I'm glad you're home.</string>
  <string id="6127438">Alone</string>
  <string id="6127476">We examined Emeric's body and the place where he died, but found no clues.</string>
  <string id="6127477">Of course. You can count on me.</string>
  <string id="6127481">I apologize, but it is it the best I can do at the moment.</string>
  <string id="6127484">Trigger shady dealer letter.</string>
  <string id="6127485">Trigger shady dealer letter.</string>
  <string id="6127486">Is there anything you can do?</string>
  <string id="6127487">Can you help me?</string>
  <string id="6127488">Either that or she's on a really long walk.</string>
  <string id="6127489">She didn't have travel plans.</string>
  <string id="6127493">Don't just stand there. Didn't you take over Emeric's investigation?</string>
  <string id="6127494">Do something.</string>
  <string id="6127495">I did, but I've found little.</string>
  <string id="6127498">I will speak to my superiors and alert the city guard. They'll keep a lookout for your mother.</string>
  <string id="6127502">No, no! I'm content... with my choice.</string>
  <string id="6127503">I suppose you would see it in a bad light.</string>
  <string id="6127508">It's a kind gift. I should put this away somewhere.</string>
  <string id="6127511">I've said something stupid, haven't I?</string>
  <string id="6127512">I do like it! I'm sorry I'm making a mess of this...</string>
  <string id="6127513">I... of course. You're just being thoughtful.</string>
  <string id="6127517">I'm not interested in living in the past.</string>
  <string id="6127518">Stop it.</string>
  <string id="6127519">I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6127530">No one has ever given me a present before. Useful things. Tools or clothes. Because I needed them. Not... just because. </string>
  <string id="6127533">Ma serannas. I'll find a good place for this.</string>
  <string id="6127537">I know you don't want to be tied down, and I would never do that to you.</string>
  <string id="6127538">I'm not proposing marriage.</string>
  <string id="6127544">Come on, Daisy. You shouldn't be stuck in this rat-trap. Does Hawke even know you're here?</string>
  <string id="6127547">I don't have to ask permission to come to my own house, Varric.</string>
  <string id="6127548">Come on, Daisy. You've been holed up in here for days. If you don't get some sunshine, you'll wilt.</string>
  <string id="6127551">I'm not a plant, Varric. I'm fine.</string>
  <string id="6127556">Just take a walk around the Lowtown market. Get some air, and I'll stop bothering you.</string>
  <string id="6127560">I thought you of all people would understand.</string>
  <string id="6127563">You knew this was wrong. You told me you were going to stop it!</string>
  <string id="6127564">I thought you'd changed.</string>
  <string id="6127565">I tried. Justice... Vengeance... He was too strong for me.</string>
  <string id="6127568">Justice once told me that demons are just spirits perverted by their desires.</string>
  <string id="6127571">I made my friend a demon. And he did this.</string>
  <string id="6127574">Kill me now before there is nothing of me left.</string>
  <string id="6127576">I forgive you.</string>
  <string id="6127577">I know you would have changed it if you could.</string>
  <string id="6127580">But I have proven I cannot. If I couldn't control Vengeance now, I never will.</string>
  <string id="6127583">I need to die.</string>
  <string id="6127584">I still love you, Anders. I will never stop loving you.</string>
  <string id="6127587">But I know better than anyone that love alone should not stay your hand.</string>
  <string id="6127590">Kill me if you must. I knew there was that chance.</string>
  <string id="6127591">It was a noble cause. Perhaps it will be worth it in the end.</string>
  <string id="6127594">Truly? Then... you do not wish me dead for my actions?</string>
  <string id="6127596">This was your plan, Anders?</string>
  <string id="6127597">Was that... why you needed me to distract the grand cleric?</string>
  <string id="6127600">If you knew what I was doing, you would have felt honor-bound to stop me. I couldn't take that chance.</string>
  <string id="6127603">I could have stopped you.</string>
  <string id="6127606">No. This had to happen.</string>
  <string id="6127609">I removed the chance of compromise, because there is no compromise.</string>
  <string id="6127614">I... know you mean well. But I have too much to do right now.</string>
  <string id="6127617">I'll let you talk some sense into her, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6127620">Varric is... very sweet. Frequently infuriating and a terrible busybody, but sweet. </string>
  <string id="6127627">Things are different now.</string>
  <string id="6127630">I... probably should have told Bodahn where I was going. I hope I didn't worry you.</string>
  <string id="6127633">Friedrich's Guard</string>
  <string id="6127637">Friedrich's Guard</string>
  <string id="6127645">I never noticed those things.</string>
  <string id="6127646">Never noticed.</string>
  <string id="6127647">Speak to Fenris at his Hightown mansion.</string>
  <string id="6127649">That's what I say!</string>
  <string id="6127652">I knew you were special from the moment I laid eyes on you. You're someone worthy of... a duel.</string>
  <string id="6127653">Really? But those things are what make Lowtown... well, Lowtown!</string>
  <string id="6127654">The templar?</string>
  <string id="6127659">Are you sure about this? You know she's going to murder people whose only crime was being born a mage.</string>
  <string id="6127660">What do you want me to do? Let the city go up in flames?</string>
  <string id="6127661">You have a better idea?</string>
  <string id="6127662">Innocent people will be hurt in the fighting. We have to make this as quick and painless as possible.</string>
  <string id="6127663">We have to end the chaos.</string>
  <string id="6127664">It's a bad choice. The mages are defending themselves, and the templars are just protecting the city.</string>
  <string id="6127665">We're out of options.</string>
  <string id="6127676">It broke his heart. Destroyed him.</string>
  <string id="6127677">Good. I... appreciate it.</string>
  <string id="6127680">Anders condemned the Circle already. The grand cleric was beloved by the entire city.</string>
  <string id="6127681">Anders tied our hands.</string>
  <string id="6127682">Either the templars annul the Circle or the citizens of Kirkwall will riot and murder the mages themselves.</string>
  <string id="6127685">All we can do now is try to keep casualties to a minimum.</string>
  <string id="6127698">People will die no matter what we choose. Anders made sure of that.</string>
  <string id="6127699">I think we agree that nobody wants mages and templars fighting in the streets.</string>
  <string id="6127886">I suppose... you're right. This decision was taken out of our hands.</string>
  <string id="6127889">By the killer? That's... not good. I didn't expect him to strike again so soon.</string>
  <string id="6127890">Why?</string>
  <string id="6127893">Not your business.</string>
  <string id="6127963">Oh? I can come up with much crazier things in my dreams.</string>
  <string id="6127964">You need better dreams.</string>
  <string id="6127965">It's not that.</string>
  <string id="6127969">We could work on that.</string>
  <string id="6127970">If it brings your memory back, maybe we need to do it more often.</string>
  <string id="6127973">Don't you want to get your memories back?</string>
  <string id="6127976">Perhaps you don't realize how upsetting this is.</string>
  <string id="6127979">I've never remembered anything, and to have it all come back in a rush, only to lose it...</string>
  <string id="6127982">I can't... I can't.</string>
  <string id="6127983">You're the one who came to me, remember?</string>
  <string id="6127984">You started this!</string>
  <string id="6127985">Yes, you should.</string>
  <string id="6127988">It could be.</string>
  <string id="6127989">I might be able to help with your problems... or give you a few more.</string>
  <string id="6127990">They could be.</string>
  <string id="6127991">More problems than you normally do, I assume.</string>
  <string id="6127994">Chuckles Only a few?</string>
  <string id="6127997">Or a lot.</string>
  <string id="6128000">The good kind.</string>
  <string id="6128003">It depends if I really work at it.</string>
  <string id="6128006">Tempting.</string>
  <string id="6128009">You're a handsome man, Hawke. Is there no one else who has your... attention?</string>
  <string id="6128010">You think I'm handsome?</string>
  <string id="6128011">You're a beautiful woman, Hawke. Is there no one else who has your... attention?</string>
  <string id="6128012">I didn't quite catch that first part.</string>
  <string id="6128013">You think I'm beautiful?</string>
  <string id="6128014">Chuckles I don't need to repeat the obvious, I'm certain.</string>
  <string id="6128018">Not yet.</string>
  <string id="6128019">The day's still young.</string>
  <string id="6128022">I'm an attentive man.</string>
  <string id="6128025">I'm an attentive woman.</string>
  <string id="6128028">Do you see anyone else here?</string>
  <string id="6128029">Just you.</string>
  <string id="6128051">I'm an escaped slave, and an elf, living in a borrowed mansion. None of those things bother you?</string>
  <string id="6128052">Not for what I have in mind.</string>
  <string id="6128053">I'm not proposing marriage.</string>
  <string id="6128054">Well that's something.</string>
  <string id="6128057">Why do you think that would bother me?</string>
  <string id="6128058">Not at all.</string>
  <string id="6128059">You are not most people, clearly.</string>
  <string id="6128062">And I'm an apostate refugee. Does that bother you?</string>
  <string id="6128063">I'm a mage, remember?</string>
  <string id="6128064">And I'm a refugee as well as a human. Does that bother you?</string>
  <string id="6128065">I'm not without faults.</string>
  <string id="6128066">You have me there.</string>
  <string id="6128069">You raise an interesting point. I'll have to... consider it.</string>
  <string id="6128072">Are you saying what I think you're saying?</string>
  <string id="6128073">So you've never...?</string>
  <string id="6128077">If there was someone before, I have no memory of it.</string>
  <string id="6128078">There was no one after you escaped, even?</string>
  <string id="6128079">And since?</string>
  <string id="6128080">I stayed nowhere for long. Who would I trust?</string>
  <string id="6128083">I didn't think I needed anyone. Or wanted anyone. Until now.</string>
  <string id="6128101">Leliana</string>
  <string id="6128103">If you think that is a better atonement than my death, I am with you for so long as I can maintain my grip on the monster inside me.</string>
  <string id="6128106">I give up.</string>
  <string id="6128115">I am trying to honor them both.</string>
  <string id="6128118">Don't bury Mahariel yet! We don't know for certain...</string>
  <string id="6128123">I'm trying to honor him.</string>
  <string id="6128126">Still lying to yourself... Just go.</string>
  <string id="6128131">Why are you doing this?</string>
  <string id="6128134">Fenarel... I've explained before. </string>
  <string id="6128137">No, you haven't. You wring your hands and stammer and declare that nobody understands what you're doing.</string>
  <string id="6128142">Darktown</string>
  <string id="6128143">Leave Area</string>
  <string id="6128272">Mahariel isn't coming back, and nothing you do will restore him to us.</string>
  <string id="6128275">I... I can't believe I turned on you... with the demon... in the Fade... I'm so sorry. Ma serannas. </string>
  <string id="6128276">Remember Alessa, the woman you rescued? Just as I predicted, he took her not long after you found us.</string>
  <string id="6128282">I'll understand if you can't forgive me.</string>
  <string id="6128283">The Hanged Man</string>
  <string id="6128286">From Elren</string>
  <string id="6128287">Messere Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
Words aren't enough to convey how grateful I am! Thank you for saving my daughter from that monster. When I look at my little girl, I'm reminded of what you did for my family.&#13;
&#13;
Lia has found a hero in you. She's become interested in swordplay and combat, and she speaks of joining the guard one day. She seems none the worse for wear.&#13;
&#13;
In your debt,&#13;
Elren&#13;
</string>
  <string id="6128288">Messere Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
I feel I must apologize. You did what you had to when you turned Kelder over to the guards. You saved my daughter, and I should have been more thankful.&#13;
&#13;
Lia has been difficult. We left Kirkwall behind, but my poor girl now thinks every man is a monster in disguise. I fear she may never get past this.&#13;
&#13;
In your debt,&#13;
Elren&#13;
</string>
  <string id="6128291">I have enough of her blood for one ritual. I can use it to track them.</string>
  <string id="6128292">Yes, serah. I know of no other way.</string>
  <string id="6128293">Do you think we'll find my mother in time?</string>
  <string id="6128294">Is my mother still alive?</string>
  <string id="6128295">You can pray for it.</string>
  <string id="6128298">But with your help, we could go now. He'll be no match for us.</string>
  <string id="6128305">The time for talk is over. The battle is about to begin.</string>
  <string id="6128309">I should have trusted you. Even with all we've shared, I never thought you'd spare my life.</string>
  <string id="6128312">If we live through this... you know I'll be hunted. No one in Kirkwall will offer me mercy.</string>
  <string id="6128315">But... if you would join me, I'd rather be on the run with you than safe with anyone else.</string>
  <string id="6128316">If we win this, I'll kill anyone who tries to arrest you.</string>
  <string id="6128317">I'll defend you.</string>
  <string id="6128318">Kirkwall can't change alone, love. Even if we win here, it will take years of open warfare throughout Thedas before mages can be safe.</string>
  <string id="6128321">If you wish to stay with me, you must join me in that fight.</string>
  <string id="6128322">Then we will be fugitives together.</string>
  <string id="6128323">I will join you.</string>
  <string id="6128324">We will fight for a world where our children can be born mages and free.</string>
  <string id="6128327">We can build a world where no ever dies for being how the Maker created them.</string>
  <string id="6128330">I know I'll never be the most important thing in your life. I won't kill you, but I'm not coming with you.</string>
  <string id="6128331">This is the end, Anders.</string>
  <string id="6128332">I wish I had no loyalties greater than you. That's the freedom I'm fighting for.</string>
  <string id="6128335">Ten years, a hundred years from now, someone like me will love someone like you, and there will be no templars to tear them apart.</string>
  <string id="6128338">May the Maker bring us victory. Or everything else is meaningless.</string>
  <string id="6128339">I underestimated you, Hawke. I really thought when it was put to the test, you'd have to kill me.</string>
  <string id="6128342">You truly are the leader we've been waiting centuries for.</string>
  <string id="6128343">You are an example to us all.</string>
  <string id="6128344">Mages must have their freedom. It might as well begin here.</string>
  <string id="6128345">It's the right thing to do.</string>
  <string id="6128346">Oh, stop. You're making me blush.</string>
  <string id="6128347">That's so sweet.</string>
  <string id="6128348">Our victory here will change Thedas forever.</string>
  <string id="6128349">We will win this.</string>
  <string id="6128350">I never imagined you'd be standing beside me now.</string>
  <string id="6128353">Thank you for standing by me. We would not have reached this point without you.</string>
  <string id="6128356">May the Maker bring us victory. Maybe if He shows His approval, the world will finally be ready to change.</string>
  <string id="6128360">Is it only my weakness that makes me wish you had killed me?</string>
  <string id="6128363">I feel Vengeance scrabbling inside like a mad beast, and it hurts even to imagine turning against my people.</string>
  <string id="6128366">Do you truly think we can still turn this around?</string>
  <string id="6128367">We must show that the revolution failed. Then the mages can work for peaceful change.</string>
  <string id="6128368">This is the best way.</string>
  <string id="6128369">Perhaps they will. But I will not be part of it.</string>
  <string id="6128372">Don't worry, we'll almost certainly die out there anyway.</string>
  <string id="6128373">Probably not.</string>
  <string id="6128374">You joke, but it must be true.</string>
  <string id="6128377">I'm glad you see that.</string>
  <string id="6128380">You said you'd atone for your crimes. Don't complain about it.</string>
  <string id="6128381">This is your penance.</string>
  <string id="6128382">I will do my best to make up for the damage I caused, but I cannot live past this.</string>
  <string id="6128385">Show me you're serious about making up for what you've done.</string>
  <string id="6128386">We'll do it together.</string>
  <string id="6128387">You've always tried to save me from myself, but I was cursed before I met you.</string>
  <string id="6128390">Vengeance will always be inside me. I cannot risk losing myself to him again.</string>
  <string id="6128393">But if I die—now or after—perhaps it will be Justice and not Vengeance who rises from my corpse.</string>
  <string id="6128396">I will always love you.</string>
  <string id="6128397">Goodbye, Hawke. You've been a better friend than I ever knew.</string>
  <string id="6128400">Sounds like you're ready to move on.</string>
  <string id="6128401">So you're over Wesley.</string>
  <string id="6128402">It's been four years since Wesley. Stop trying to protect me.</string>
  <string id="6128406">It's been four years, and it's not your place to judge how I mourn Wesley.</string>
  <string id="6128411">That's right. She's made her peace. Now let her get one.</string>
  <string id="6128412">I've made my peace. He'd want me to live.</string>
  <string id="6128413">We've had that talk. This isn't about Wesley.</string>
  <string id="6128419">Anders asked for assistance performing several suspicious-sounding tasks, and was refused.</string>
  <string id="6128449">Are we... what did this mean?</string>
  <string id="6128483">You got to realize this is kind of new to me.</string>
  <string id="6128486">I didn't know Mara had a baby. If I did, I would have—I don't know—gone after her or something.</string>
  <string id="6128489">She used to say I was so much like you, and I didn't even know who you were.</string>
  <string id="6128492">I need some time to think about all this, but... if it's all right, I'd like to come back and talk more.</string>
  <string id="6128495">I think I'd like that.</string>
  <string id="6128498">Uh... keep... uh... safe?</string>
  <string id="6128504">Looks like you two had a good talk.</string>
  <string id="6128507">It was bloody awkward, that's what.</string>
  <string id="6128508">She looks nothing like you. Thank the Maker for small miracles, hmm?</string>
  <string id="6128509">She's a lucky girl.</string>
  <string id="6128510">Really. I... hey!</string>
  <string id="6128513">Don't mess this up, old man.</string>
  <string id="6128514">Watch yourself.</string>
  <string id="6128515">I hope I don't. I failed Mara. I don't want to fail her too.</string>
  <string id="6128518">I was worried she wouldn't come find you. I think you need each other.</string>
  <string id="6128519">I'm glad she came by.</string>
  <string id="6128520">You know, I may not say this very often, but I'm glad you're one of the family.</string>
  <string id="6128523">But seriously, next time? Stay out of my damned business, girl.</string>
  <string id="6128526">But seriously, next time? Stay out of my damned business, boy.</string>
  <string id="6128528">Varric, no.</string>
  <string id="6128531">Let's just say I don't want to lose track of you.</string>
  <string id="6128532">But there's profit and influence to be had. You're my friend, so I'm offering.</string>
  <string id="6128546">You're the captain, or you will be. It'll be easy.</string>
  <string id="6128549">I'm not petitioning the viscount to help you steal ownership of the Hanged Man.</string>
  <string id="6128552">Steal? Madam, you wound me.</string>
  <string id="6128555">I'm about to. </string>
  <string id="6128639">I've got something to show you! Come and see.</string>
  <string id="6128642">It's beautiful, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6128643">You're much prettier.</string>
  <string id="6128644">It's not as pretty as you are.</string>
  <string id="6128645">I'm sure you say that to Varric at least once a day.</string>
  <string id="6128648">Twice, usually. But can you blame him? Nobody can resist this face.</string>
  <string id="6128651">Way more than once a day. She can barely keep her hands off me! Pity I'm not into humans.</string>
  <string id="6128654">Oh, you're too kind! Is... it warm in here? Stop babbling, Merrill...</string>
  <string id="6128657">Of all the giant mirrors in your house, Merrill, this is easily the nicest.</string>
  <string id="6128658">Yes, it is.</string>
  <string id="6128659">I knew, if anyone would understand, you would.</string>
  <string id="6128662">Something seems... off about your mirror. Shouldn't it reflect the room?</string>
  <string id="6128663">There's no reflection.</string>
  <string id="6128664">No. It's not that sort of mirror.</string>
  <string id="6128667">Why are you showing me this, exactly?</string>
  <string id="6128668">It's just a mirror.</string>
  <string id="6128669">It's not just a mirror! I mean, it is a mirror, but it's magic! Or it will be.</string>
  <string id="6128672">I've spent the last few years restoring this.</string>
  <string id="6128675">Two of my clan stumbled across it in a ruin.</string>
  <string id="6128678">We never found Tamlen. And Mahariel came back... poisoned by the eluvian. Sick just from being near it.</string>
  <string id="6128679">One of my clan found it in the Brecilian Forest, we think.</string>
  <string id="6128682">Poor Tamlen. We never found him. Just the shattered pieces of the eluvian.</string>
  <string id="6128683">What's an eluvian?</string>
  <string id="6128684">Eluvian?</string>
  <string id="6128685">Long ago, the elves had a kingdom. An empire that covered Thedas. And every city had an eluvian.</string>
  <string id="6128688">The mirrors let them communicate across their empire. But I don't know how, exactly.</string>
  <string id="6128691">My people have lost so much. We know almost nothing of the days before Arlathan. This is a piece of our history.</string>
  <string id="6128692">What are you trying to do with this mirror?</string>
  <string id="6128693">Why did you bring it here?</string>
  <string id="6128694">At first, I wanted to find out what happened to my friends. Maybe I could still help them.</string>
  <string id="6128697">But the Keeper said Mahariel died to stop the Blight. I'll never...</string>
  <string id="6128700">I suppose the great Hero of Ferelden doesn't need my help now.</string>
  <string id="6128703">Anyway, I know I can use it to help my people recover what we've lost.</string>
  <string id="6128704">At first, I just wanted to find Tamlen.</string>
  <string id="6128707">But, it's been too long... Tamlen is probably dead by now, if he wasn't already.</string>
  <string id="6128710">But still, I know it can help my people. I can at least recover this one small part of our heritage.</string>
  <string id="6128711">Did your clan member recover?</string>
  <string id="6128712">What did it do to Mahariel?</string>
  <string id="6128713">The Keeper treated him, but she said it was the Blight. The corruption.</string>
  <string id="6128716">A Grey Warden took him away. He said the Wardens had the means to cure him.</string>
  <string id="6128719">It must have been true. The Keeper said that he fought the Archdemon himself.</string>
  <string id="6128720">She had the Blight corruption, the Keeper said. Marethari's magic was keeping it at bay, but not forever. </string>
  <string id="6128723">A Grey Warden took her away. He promised they could cure her.</string>
  <string id="6128726">I suppose they must have. The Keeper said she led the armies that slew the Archdemon.</string>
  <string id="6128727">Do you think the mirror had something to do with Tamlen's disappearance?</string>
  <string id="6128728">The mirror killed someone?</string>
  <string id="6128729">The ruin we tracked Tamlen to was full of traps and monstrous things, but we found no body.</string>
  <string id="6128732">His trail ended at the broken pieces of eluvian.</string>
  <string id="6128733">This thing is what made the Keeper send you away, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6128734">Is this why you left the clan?</string>
  <string id="6128735">The Keeper wanted me to destroy the fragment I kept. She said our ancestors meant it to be forgotten.</string>
  <string id="6128738">But it's a Keeper's place to remember! Even the dangerous things. We argued. I... left. </string>
  <string id="6128741">She's wrong. This mirror could teach us so much about who we once were!</string>
  <string id="6128742">This thing may have killed someone, and you brought it here?</string>
  <string id="6128743">Are you crazy?</string>
  <string id="6128744">I'm sure you wouldn't show something this dangerous to just anyone.</string>
  <string id="6128745">I'm glad you told me.</string>
  <string id="6128746">Tell me you didn't bring the killer mirror to Kirkwall just because it's pretty.</string>
  <string id="6128747">Why'd you take it?</string>
  <string id="6128748">It's not dangerous, I promise! I fixed it. Or tried to. With blood magic. The mirror won't hurt anyone.</string>
  <string id="6128751">But... it doesn't work. I've tried everything, and I think it's because it needs to be finished with a special tool.</string>
  <string id="6128754">An arulin'holm. And my clan has one. It's been in their hands for generations...</string>
  <string id="6128755">Go talk to the Keeper, then.</string>
  <string id="6128756">So ask for it.</string>
  <string id="6128757">I just can't!</string>
  <string id="6128760">But you're afraid to face Keeper Marethari again.</string>
  <string id="6128761">You need my help.</string>
  <string id="6128762">Exactly.</string>
  <string id="6128765">I hear a but coming.</string>
  <string id="6128766">There's always a catch.</string>
  <string id="6128767">I can't go back there alone.</string>
  <string id="6128770">You have no idea. The Keeper... I can't talk to her. We fight or talk circles around each other.</string>
  <string id="6128773">She has a disappointed frown that turns your bones to jelly! Please help me? You will, won't you?</string>
  <string id="6128774">I'll go with you.</string>
  <string id="6128775">I'll help.</string>
  <string id="6128776">Ma serannas! I'll find some way to repay you, I promise!</string>
  <string id="6128777">I'm not helping you fix a mirror that kills people.</string>
  <string id="6128778">Forget it.</string>
  <string id="6128779">It doesn't— Sighs I guess it was foolish of me to ask. I'll just have to find another way.</string>
  <string id="6128782">Go to Lowtown's Hanged Man pub with Fenris to meet his sister during the day.</string>
  <string id="6128793">Clan Craftmaster</string>
  <string id="6128797">We're in the right place. Let's look around.</string>
  <string id="6128798">It's not like this job means we're on opposite sides. The good you do, it seems rather appropriate.</string>
  <string id="6128801">I know what you get up to. And soon, the whole city will be my responsibility.</string>
  <string id="6128806">Mother's locket. This isn't a good sign.</string>
  <string id="6128807">It's Mother's locket. She wouldn't willingly part with it.</string>
  <string id="6128818">Profit and Loss</string>
  <string id="6128819">Tell me about it.</string>
  <string id="6128822">You have some loyal friends...</string>
  <string id="6128825">A dwarf is waiting at the mansion. Go speak with him.</string>
  <string id="6128826">The dwarf was Dougal, who paid for the expedition three years ago. He demanded more coin, which was provided, and went on his way.</string>
  <string id="6128827">Dougal died in an attempted ambush and won't be a bother again.</string>
  <string id="6128830">Interim captain. Can't just promote a Fereldan outright.</string>
  <string id="6128831">The dwarf was Dougal, who paid for the expedition three years ago. He demanded more coin, but was refused, and swore he would return again later.</string>
  <string id="6128844">It was just a fling.</string>
  <string id="6128845">This didn't mean anything.</string>
  <string id="6128846">Magister Danarius has Fenris. Unless Fenris escapes, he is gone forever.</string>
  <string id="6128847">Kill Magister Danarius.</string>
  <string id="6128858">Mother always knew me best.</string>
  <string id="6128859">You bastard! I'm going to kill you!</string>
  <string id="6128860">I was wondering when you'd show up. Leandra was so sure you'd come for her.</string>
  <string id="6128866">I care about you, Merrill. I wanted to check on you.</string>
  <string id="6128867">Just making sure you're all right.</string>
  <string id="6128872">I'll give you a hint. It has to do with demons. And slitting your wrists.</string>
  <string id="6128874">Just don't. Please don't say you're doing this for my sake.</string>
  <string id="6128877">Well, well. If it isn't the man of the hour.</string>
  <string id="6128880">Well, well. Now it's beginning to all make sense.</string>
  <string id="6128883">Do I know you?</string>
  <string id="6128886">I know him. I thought Bartrand told you to clear off, Dougal.</string>
  <string id="6128889">Calm yourself, Varric. I just wanted to meet your brother's new business partner.</string>
  <string id="6128890">Not yet, but I wager you'll be glad we met.</string>
  <string id="6128893">The name's Dougal Gavorn. And you're Bartrand's new business partner.</string>
  <string id="6128900">Here's the coin.</string>
  <string id="6128902">Forget it.</string>
  <string id="6128903">Fenris allowed his sister to leave. He won't talk about the matter now.</string>
  <string id="6128909">Yes, and she spoke so fondly of you. What a lovely, gentle woman.</string>
  <string id="6128914">I was afraid you might say that.</string>
  <string id="6128915">Fenris killed his sister. He won't talk about the matter now.</string>
  <string id="6128918">Now we both decide what happens next.</string>
  <string id="6128919">We're together now.</string>
  <string id="6128920">You know, we might have to try that a few more times to really get the meaning...</string>
  <string id="6128921">I'm willing to find out.</string>
  <string id="6128922">The next time you betray me, I'll cut you down.</string>
  <string id="6128923">This is your last chance.</string>
  <string id="6128924">You didn't betray me, the demon made you do it.</string>
  <string id="6128925">It wasn't you.</string>
  <string id="6128926">If I held a grudge against everyone who attacked me in a dream, I'd have no friends.</string>
  <string id="6128927">These things happen.</string>
  <string id="6128930">Of course. I suppose I'm just being silly, thinking...</string>
  <string id="6128933">I should go.</string>
  <string id="6128936">You're really not afraid?</string>
  <string id="6128937">If you hadn't come to Sundermount that day... I can't imagine where I'd be now.</string>
  <string id="6128938">Laughs Do you think we shall ever get to the bottom of it?</string>
  <string id="6128939">You're as blind as she is. She's been wasting her time trying to court you.</string>
  <string id="6128942">I'd hoped we were more than that.</string>
  <string id="6128945">Hate you? I care more than you know.</string>
  <string id="6128948">Then why do this? I have to fix it. He'll file a complaint... ask for a transfer.</string>
  <string id="6128958">I love you. I probably shouldn't have said that, should I? I always say the stupidest things...</string>
  <string id="6128962">That was a little too soon.</string>
  <string id="6128963">Why? Are you afraid? Hoping Gascard would've forgotten what you did?</string>
  <string id="6128964">Scared to face him?</string>
  <string id="6128967">I love you, too. Live with me.</string>
  <string id="6128970">You definitely shouldn't have said that.</string>
  <string id="6128971">I think it's too early to talk about love.</string>
  <string id="6128972">It's dangerous throwing words like love around. Someone could get hurt.</string>
  <string id="6128973">You don't say stupid things. I love you, and I want you here with me.</string>
  <string id="6128974">I love you, Merrill. Actually, I was going to suggest you move in with me.</string>
  <string id="6128975">I was thinking of scandalizing the neighbors by having my Dalish lover move in. What do you think?</string>
  <string id="6128978">I knew I'd make a mess of things.</string>
  <string id="6128979">What's done is done. No point in beating yourself up.</string>
  <string id="6128980">Stop worrying.</string>
  <string id="6128981">Yes, it's all a game with no consequence. Easy for anyone with a lick of sense.</string>
  <string id="6128984">I didn't say that.</string>
  <string id="6128987">It's what I heard. And I won't do this again.</string>
  <string id="6128991">Afraid? Of Gascard? Laughs No, Gascard respects me too much to kill me.</string>
  <string id="6129004">Here? In Hightown? The rich, fancy part of the city with no rats in it? And you... with an elf?</string>
  <string id="6129007">Ma vhenan... you really are crazy, aren't you?</string>
  <string id="6129009">Finding Home</string>
  <string id="6129012">If you're not afraid, then... neither am I.</string>
  <string id="6129015">The Amells' Hightown mansion has been restored. Bodahn suggested returning there as soon as possible.</string>
  <string id="6129016">The Amell mansion is now home to Hawke and family, a big step up from squatting with Gamlen.</string>
  <string id="6129017">I won't... I would never... ma serannas.</string>
  <string id="6129018">I should have recognized I was being manipulated...</string>
  <string id="6129019">How do you do that? Make everything better with a smile? It's like magic that doesn't get you in trouble.</string>
  <string id="6129029">Strong lips. Has to be.</string>
  <string id="6129030">I know I wouldn't turn you down.</string>
  <string id="6129031">It'd work on me.</string>
  <string id="6129032">Well. Happy?</string>
  <string id="6129035">I think you can safely claim both halves of that pair.</string>
  <string id="6129036">You helped with both.</string>
  <string id="6129037">You're sweet. I knew asking you was the right thing.</string>
  <string id="6129040">Let's not make a habit of it.</string>
  <string id="6129043">Was there a moment when you thought I was beyond help?</string>
  <string id="6129044">Let's just say that if I were you, I'd make this last.</string>
  <string id="6129045">Yes, so be careful.</string>
  <string id="6129046">Not for a second.</string>
  <string id="6129047">Never.</string>
  <string id="6129048">Don't ruin the moment. It was hard work getting here.</string>
  <string id="6129049">You don't need to know.</string>
  <string id="6129050">It won't happen again. I'll make sure of that.</string>
  <string id="6129051">Laughs Oh, is that what you've been telling people, Gascard? Your sister?</string>
  <string id="6129054">Shut up! I'm going to learn your secrets, old man. Everything you kept from me.</string>
  <string id="6129059">Laughs So what's the word in Lowtown, Varric?</string>
  <string id="6129062">You don't lie very well.</string>
  <string id="6129065">As far as you know.</string>
  <string id="6129068">Point taken.</string>
  <string id="6129071">All right. Fair enough.</string>
  <string id="6129078">Oh! There you are!</string>
  <string id="6129081">I've been looking everywhere for you, messere. If only you humans didn't all look the same!</string>
  <string id="6129082">Is there something you want, Bodahn?</string>
  <string id="6129083">What is it now?</string>
  <string id="6129084">I was called to the Keep on important business, Bodahn.</string>
  <string id="6129085">I had to meet the viscount.</string>
  <string id="6129086">Yes, I was hoping to catch you before you arrived.</string>
  <string id="6129089">We can't all be short and bearded like your people, Bodahn.</string>
  <string id="6129090">And dwarves are so varied?</string>
  <string id="6129091">Indeed! It's quite a shame, really.</string>
  <string id="6129094">There's a, er, gentleman waiting at the mansion. He insists on seeing you.</string>
  <string id="6129097">He says his name is Dougal. Your mother thought it wise I tell you, messere.</string>
  <string id="6129098">I paid Dougal years ago. Why would he be back now?</string>
  <string id="6129099">What does he want?</string>
  <string id="6129100">He wouldn't tell me, I'm afraid.</string>
  <string id="6129103">He refused to come back another day, even after I told him repeatedly that I didn't know when you would return.</string>
  <string id="6129106">He doesn't really seem like the most reputable sort, I'm afraid. Even for a dwarf.</string>
  <string id="6129107">I'll talk to him as soon as I'm ready.</string>
  <string id="6129108">I'm busy.</string>
  <string id="6129109">Yes, of course. I'll let him know right away.</string>
  <string id="6129112">You left him alone in the mansion with Mother?</string>
  <string id="6129113">Is Mother all right?</string>
  <string id="6129114">My boy Sandal is with her. But, er, you make a good point. I'll run back right away.</string>
  <string id="6129117">You ran all this way just to tell me I had a visitor?</string>
  <string id="6129118">That's it?</string>
  <string id="6129119"> I didn't want to presume what you might find important, messere.</string>
  <string id="6129122">I came to deliver this to you: the last of the proceeds from all that treasure you found in the Deep Roads.</string>
  <string id="6129125">It seems your friend Varric found a buyer after all, yes? Quite well done!</string>
  <string id="6129126">I recall Varric saying there would be more.</string>
  <string id="6129127">Is this all of it?</string>
  <string id="6129128">There was, in fact, but your mother took some for the mansion.</string>
  <string id="6129131">I can put this to good use.</string>
  <string id="6129132">Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6129133">Of course! Always happy to help.</string>
  <string id="6129136">So you raced here just to give me this?</string>
  <string id="6129137">You ran all that way?</string>
  <string id="6129138">I didn't want to be responsible for so much coin! Just holding that purse was making me sweat.</string>
  <string id="6129141">Er, before I go, may I simply say how grateful I am that you've allowed my boy to stay in your home?</string>
  <string id="6129144">I said I would repay you for saving Sandal's life, and I shall serve you faithfully. It is good to know he is safe.</string>
  <string id="6129145">I assume he'll pitch in, just like you?</string>
  <string id="6129146">As long as you're useful.</string>
  <string id="6129147">Of course! I'll keep a close eye on him so his enchantments don't do any damage, I promise you that.</string>
  <string id="6129150">I didn't ask you to be my manservant, Bodahn.</string>
  <string id="6129151">You don't need to serve me.</string>
  <string id="6129152">But I owe you a debt... and after what happened in the Deep Roads, I have no other way to repay you.</string>
  <string id="6129155">Let me guess: this was Mother's idea?</string>
  <string id="6129156">What's one more mouth?</string>
  <string id="6129157">Chuckles As you say, yes.</string>
  <string id="6129160">I'll leave you to your business. Don't forget about your guest... your mother claims he was eyeing the silverware.</string>
  <string id="6129163">I'll leave you to your adventures. Your mother asks that you return to the mansion when you have the chance.</string>
  <string id="6129182">The varterral is dead.</string>
  <string id="6129185">Ma serannas. I'll breathe easier, knowing that we will lose no more people to it.</string>
  <string id="6129188">We found these...</string>
  <string id="6129191">I'll return them to their families.</string>
  <string id="6129194">We lost Pol. In the cave, he... he fled at the sight of me, straight into the varterral.</string>
  <string id="6129197">Many of the clan fear you'll bring back the corruption—or worse—from the mirror.</string>
  <string id="6129200">And where did they get that idea?</string>
  <string id="6129203">I am their Keeper, da'len. It was my duty to warn them.</string>
  <string id="6129206">It's still not too late for you to return to us. Reconsider—there's no need for you to live alone.</string>
  <string id="6129209">Must we go over this again? You'll never accept what I'm doing.</string>
  <string id="6129212">The eluvian is poison. It killed Tamlen. It stole Mahariel. It led you to blood magic. Will you let it twist you further from who you are?</string>
  <string id="6129215">The eluvian is a trap. It cost us Tamlen. It led you to blood magic. Will you let it twist you further from who you really are?</string>
  <string id="6129218">And who am I?</string>
  <string id="6129221">We've done as you asked. Honor our bargain. Give me the arulin'holm.</string>
  <string id="6129224">Hawke... because Merrill won't listen, I give this heirloom of my clan to you for safekeeping. Please... don't let her do this.</string>
  <string id="6129230">Thank the Creators! I thought... maybe she'd go back on her word.</string>
  <string id="6129231">Is it worth restoring this mirror if it turns your clan against you?</string>
  <string id="6129232">Do you really want this?</string>
  <string id="6129233">You know what it's like to lose everything, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6129236">Not just our land and freedom, but history, stories, language, magic, rituals. Even our gods are gone!</string>
  <string id="6129239">It is a sacrifice, but if the mirror restores even one fragment of the past, it's worth it.</string>
  <string id="6129240">What did the Keeper mean, the mirror led you to blood magic?</string>
  <string id="6129241">She talked about blood magic?</string>
  <string id="6129242">I... the shard I picked up was corrupted. I couldn't cleanse it without help.</string>
  <string id="6129245">The Keeper refused. She said that it belonged to another time, and should be left there.</string>
  <string id="6129248">So I found a... spirit. It gave me the power to purify the mirror through blood magic.</string>
  <string id="6129249">I've never heard of blood magic purifying anything.</string>
  <string id="6129250">Purified with blood magic?</string>
  <string id="6129251">There's nothing inherently evil about blood magic. It's magic, like any other.</string>
  <string id="6129254">Are you really that stupid?</string>
  <string id="6129257">The power that contaminated the mirror was too strong to be driven out by normal means.</string>
  <string id="6129260">If I had piles of lyrium lying about, I could have used that, but I didn't. I used what I had.</string>
  <string id="6129261">Take the knife, and let's get out of here.</string>
  <string id="6129262">The arulin'holm is yours.</string>
  <string id="6129263">I hope this helps you finish your work on the eluvian.</string>
  <string id="6129264">The arulin'holm is yours.</string>
  <string id="6129265">Don't lose that knife. I get the feeling the Keeper is as good at wielding guilt as my mother.</string>
  <string id="6129266">The arulin'holm is yours.</string>
  <string id="6129267">Take the knife. Just try not to cut yourself with it.</string>
  <string id="6129268">The arulin'holm is yours.</string>
  <string id="6129269">Thank you! I knew you would understand!</string>
  <string id="6129272">Working on that mirror is crazy. You need to stop this.</string>
  <string id="6129273">The Keeper is right.</string>
  <string id="6129274">Merrill, the eluvian is ruining your life. You don't want to do this.</string>
  <string id="6129275">The Keeper is right.</string>
  <string id="6129276">Everyone else seems to be terrified of this mirror of yours. Maybe you should be, too.</string>
  <string id="6129277">The Keeper is right.</string>
  <string id="6129278">You're siding with the Keeper?</string>
  <string id="6129281">This is dangerous, yes, but it is restoring something vital to my people!</string>
  <string id="6129284">I know what I'm doing, Hawke. Give me the arulin'holm.</string>
  <string id="6129285">It's yours.</string>
  <string id="6129286">Fine, take it.</string>
  <string id="6129287">Thank you. I'm glad you saw reason.</string>
  <string id="6129290">Let's be away from here. The others are giving me the evil eye.</string>
  <string id="6129291">I'm keeping it. I can't let you do this.</string>
  <string id="6129292">No. I can't do that.</string>
  <string id="6129293">You're keeping a priceless heirloom of my clan? You have no right! You're not even Dalish!</string>
  <string id="6129296">I can't believe you! Why did I trust you? You're just a shemlen like all the others!</string>
  <string id="6129299">I... I have nothing further to say.</string>
  <string id="6129305">Keeper.</string>
  <string id="6129308">You return to us, da'len. Have you reconsidered this path at last?</string>
  <string id="6129311">I...</string>
  <string id="6129312">She came to ask you for something.</string>
  <string id="6129313">No, she hasn't.</string>
  <string id="6129314">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6129317">Go on, I'm with you.</string>
  <string id="6129318">You can do this, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6129319">Thank you, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6129322">Hello again, Keeper! Don't you look lovely!</string>
  <string id="6129323">Well, this is awkward.</string>
  <string id="6129324">My apologies, Hawke. Be welcome among the Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6129327">Keeper, I need the arulin'holm, the ancient carving blade that Master Ilen keeps.</string>
  <string id="6129330">I see. You wish to rebuild the eluvian.</string>
  <string id="6129333">You don't have to approve of it. I'm invoking vir sulevanan. I'll do whatever task you wish.</string>
  <string id="6129336">Well, I'm glad to know I can still disapprove.</string>
  <string id="6129339">It is your right. I will give you a service to perform, if you insist.</string>
  <string id="6129340">What did Merrill invoke?</string>
  <string id="6129341">What's going on?</string>
  <string id="6129342">Our history belongs to all Dalish, child, so our clan's most cherished relics can be claimed by everyone.</string>
  <string id="6129345">Any Dalish can perform a service for the clan and gain ownership of such an item. For a time.</string>
  <string id="6129348">That is what Merrill has invoked. Even if she has chosen to live apart, she is still one of the People.</string>
  <string id="6129349">What exactly is this thing we're asking for?</string>
  <string id="6129350">What is an arulin'holm?</string>
  <string id="6129351">It is an ancient carving tool used by our wood-shapers, passed down for countless generations.</string>
  <string id="6129354">Our clan has carried it since before the fall of the Dales. It is as old as Arlathan itself.</string>
  <string id="6129355">What's this service?</string>
  <string id="6129356">What do we have to do?</string>
  <string id="6129357">We appreciate your help. This means a lot to Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6129358">Thank you, Keeper.</string>
  <string id="6129359">I'm glad that Merrill has a friend in you, child. I hope you will look after her.</string>
  <string id="6129362">I can take care of myself, Keeper.</string>
  <string id="6129365">Yes, da'len. I know.</string>
  <string id="6129368">It's a lot to ask, but could you two try to be less elfy for the sake of the human present?</string>
  <string id="6129369">Speak less elven, please?</string>
  <string id="6129370">We are what we are, child. But I'll try to speak more of the common tongue.</string>
  <string id="6129373">A varterral has taken the lives of three of our hunters.</string>
  <string id="6129376">It lairs in a cavern in the mountainside. Seek it out. Slay it. No one else must fall to its anger.</string>
  <string id="6129379">Do this for us, and I will give you the arulin'holm. May the Dread Wolf never catch your scent. </string>
  <string id="6129385">Andaran atish'an, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6129398">Welcome home, da'len.</string>
  <string id="6129401">This isn't a homecoming, Keeper. Why is the clan even here? You should have moved on ages ago!</string>
  <string id="6129404">If you are not returning to us, what has brought you back?</string>
  <string id="6129411">You return to the elvhen once more, child. Andaran atish'an. What may I do for you?</string>
  <string id="6129413">You have to stop Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6129414">Merrill wants to summon a demon to help her with the mirror.</string>
  <string id="6129417">I've already done everything in my power to stop this. And some things that were beyond my strength.</string>
  <string id="6129420">Keeper, Merrill is contemplating something very dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6129423">Merrill and I are long past the point where words will turn her from her path.</string>
  <string id="6129426">Your First wants to have a chat with a demon. Can you talk sense into her?</string>
  <string id="6129429">I've tried so many times to get through to her.</string>
  <string id="6129432">I had rather hoped you might succeed where I failed.</string>
  <string id="6129435">I'll do what I can to buy you time. Talk to her. Save her from this.</string>
  <string id="6129437">How can the mirror be fixed?</string>
  <string id="6129438">What does the eluvian require to work?</string>
  <string id="6129441">If you help Merrill finish the eluvian, you'll stop her from doing something even more reckless.</string>
  <string id="6129444">Do you have any tips on ancient magic mirror repair?</string>
  <string id="6129447">I wouldn't restore that cursed thing, even if I could.</string>
  <string id="6129450">It has stolen lives: brave young souls who were well-loved by this clan. And if it is awakened, it will do far worse.</string>
  <string id="6129453">It has stolen life and promise from my clan already. And this was the least treacherous thing it was capable of doing.</string>
  <string id="6129456">You must come to your senses, Merrill. This evil cannot be allowed in our world.</string>
  <string id="6129457">Merrill must come to her senses. An evil like this must not be allowed into this world.</string>
  <string id="6129463">Andaran atish'an, child. You are always welcome among the People.</string>
  <string id="6129464">Andaran atish'an, child. I pray that the path before you is a safe one.</string>
  <string id="6129471">I'm ready, lethallin. Lead the way.</string>
  <string id="6129472">Lethallan... I'm ready. Let's end this.</string>
  <string id="6129473">I... I'm ready, I think. Just say the word.</string>
  <string id="6129476">Is this for me? It's beautiful!</string>
  <string id="6129479">Do you know what it is?</string>
  <string id="6129480">It's a piece of jewelry.</string>
  <string id="6129481">A ring.</string>
  <string id="6129482">I only know that it was made by the Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6129483">It's Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6129484">Well, I thought so right up until you asked me that.</string>
  <string id="6129485">Now I'm not so sure.</string>
  <string id="6129541">Well, yes, but that's not all.</string>
  <string id="6129543">It's sylvanwood. Rare as diamonds. You only find it in very old, very wild places.</string>
  <string id="6129544">Darktown</string>
  <string id="6129550">The carvings tell the story of the Betrayal. The Dread Wolf tricking all the gods away from the world.</string>
  <string id="6129551">Start at the beginning. What happened to the gods?</string>
  <string id="6129552">Tell me the story.</string>
  <string id="6129553">If you don't want the ring, I can get rid of it.</string>
  <string id="6129554">You don't like it, then.</string>
  <string id="6129555">I imagine the Dalish don't depict the doom of their gods just for decoration.</string>
  <string id="6129556">So the ring has meaning.</string>
  <string id="6129557">Betrayal sounds bad. Next time I'll go with flowers.</string>
  <string id="6129558">Not a good gift, I take it.</string>
  <string id="6129559">Long ago, there were two clans of gods. The Creators looked after the People. The Forgotten Ones preyed upon us.</string>
  <string id="6129572">DogName/&gt; won't stop barking. Go see what's wrong.</string>
  <string id="6129573">DogName/&gt; stopped barking, but it's uncertain why he was so upset.</string>
  <string id="6129574">DogName/&gt; found a man in the closet, but was held back from attacking the man.</string>
  <string id="6129575">DogName/&gt; found a man in the closet, and went to fetch the guards.</string>
  <string id="6129576">DogName/&gt; found a man in the closet and chased him out of the mansion.</string>
  <string id="6129577">DogName/&gt; found a man in the closet and attacked him.</string>
  <string id="6129578">DogName/&gt; eventually stopped barking. It's uncertain why he was so upset.</string>
  <string id="6129592">Beware of Dog</string>
  <string id="6129596">And one god who was neither. Fen'Harel, the Dread Wolf.</string>
  <string id="6129597">No, no! It's lovely!</string>
  <string id="6129598">Not... exactly, no.</string>
  <string id="6129599">It's not bad, exactly...</string>
  <string id="6129602">He was kin to the Creators, and in the old days, often helped them in their endless war against the Forgotten Ones.</string>
  <string id="6129603">So this Dread Wolf was a god of war?</string>
  <string id="6129604">A warrior god, then?</string>
  <string id="6129605">Why were they fighting?</string>
  <string id="6129606">The gods were at war?</string>
  <string id="6129607">I assume he got tired of helping.</string>
  <string id="6129608">But that changed?</string>
  <string id="6129610">Much worse. A trickster.</string>
  <string id="6129613">No one knows. We barely even remember all their names, let alone who struck the first blow, who was wrong...</string>
  <string id="6129616">That he did.</string>
  <string id="6129619">Fen'Harel was clever. He could walk among both clans of gods without fear, and both believed he was one of them.</string>
  <string id="6129627">He went to each side, and told them the other had forged a terrible weapon, a blade that would end the war.</string>
  <string id="6129633">He told the Creators it was forged in the heavens, and the Forgotten Ones, that it was hidden in the abyss.</string>
  <string id="6129661">And when the gods went seeking it, he sealed them both in their realms forever. Now he alone is left in the world.</string>
  <string id="6129668">This was made for a Keeper, you see. Guarding a clan from the Dread Wolf... is a Keeper's place.</string>
  <string id="6129671">I had one of these, once. And I gave it back. Ma serannas. </string>
  <string id="6129672">It's a... very sweet memento, thank you.</string>
  <string id="6129676">Once he's dead, you'll have your mother back. And his research and writings will be mine.</string>
  <string id="6129684">I will learn his art even if I have to crack his head open to expose the mysteries contained within.</string>
  <string id="6129685">Sorry to interrupt this lovely student-teacher reunion, but where is my mother?</string>
  <string id="6129686">Can I cut in here?</string>
  <string id="6129687">Listen to me. Together we can defeat Quentin.</string>
  <string id="6129709">Now this figures.</string>
  <string id="6129712">Varric! So nice to meet you again!</string>
  <string id="6129715">Let me guess: Dougal had a deal that was too good to be true?</string>
  <string id="6129718">Now, now. Just because your brother and I aren't on speaking terms doesn't mean I still can't have an interest in his ventures.</string>
  <string id="6129721">Still lacking the funds for Bartrand's little venture, I assume?</string>
  <string id="6129724">My offer stands, you know.</string>
  <string id="6129725">And just how do you know about that?</string>
  <string id="6129726">What's that to you?</string>
  <string id="6129727">Let's just say that Bartrand and I have had dealings in the past.</string>
  <string id="6129730">That remains to be seen.</string>
  <string id="6129731">I'm not a partner yet.</string>
  <string id="6129732">Yes, Bartrand was falling all over himself to enlist my help.</string>
  <string id="6129733">He was very eager.</string>
  <string id="6129734">And that's what I need to talk to you about.</string>
  <string id="6129737">Dougal's one of my dear brother's ex partners. </string>
  <string id="6129740">Bartrand turned aside my offer of help, even though I had the coin to spare. Thing is, I still think it's a promising venture.</string>
  <string id="6129743">The fool won't let me invest. But if someone like you invested on my behalf...</string>
  <string id="6129744">What do you think?</string>
  <string id="6129745">Varric?</string>
  <string id="6129746">Hard to say. Dougal's never done me any harm.</string>
  <string id="6129749">See? There you go.</string>
  <string id="6129752">Still don't trust you. You're as sour a bastard as my brother without the family connection to make it easier to swallow.</string>
  <string id="6129755">Do what you like. I came to you, not to him... but we do need the coin.</string>
  <string id="6129756">Bartrand was pretty desperate for help. He must have had a good reason to turn you down.</string>
  <string id="6129757">Why can't you invest?</string>
  <string id="6129758">He did. We had a... disagreement.</string>
  <string id="6129761">They tried to kill each other.</string>
  <string id="6129764">You've met Bartrand, yes? Someone would need the patience of a bronto not to want to kill him.</string>
  <string id="6129767">But what's done is done. Now his pride won't let him take my coin even if it ruins him.</string>
  <string id="6129768">He won't be happy if I do this.</string>
  <string id="6129769">And I should betray him?</string>
  <string id="6129770">He'd lose his mind. Not that it wouldn't be funny to watch.</string>
  <string id="6129773">Then why tell him? Bartrand is better off not knowing a lot of things.</string>
  <string id="6129776">This way he's happy, you're happy, and I'm happy. We're all happy.</string>
  <string id="6129777">Just what kind of terms are we talking about here?</string>
  <string id="6129778">What do you get out of it?</string>
  <string id="6129779">I give you what Bartrand needs.</string>
  <string id="6129782">Bartrand thinks it's your coin. Then, when the expedition's done, you pay me back double.</string>
  <string id="6129783">What if I don't have double? This might all be for nothing.</string>
  <string id="6129784">And if the expedition fails?</string>
  <string id="6129785">If you really think it's such a waste of coin, why go at all?</string>
  <string id="6129788">I think double's the very least I could earn back for this kind of investment, don't you?</string>
  <string id="6129789">This seems suspicious.</string>
  <string id="6129790">How can I trust you?</string>
  <string id="6129791">Chuckles I'm taking quite a gamble, myself.</string>
  <string id="6129794">I'm willing to bet you're a good risk. Bartrand obviously thinks so. You care to extend the same courtesy to me?</string>
  <string id="6129796">You have a deal.</string>
  <string id="6129797">All right. I'll do it.</string>
  <string id="6129800">It seems I have no choice.</string>
  <string id="6129803">Why not? I can never resist a shady deal.</string>
  <string id="6129806">Marvelous! You tell Bartrand that the coin's on the way. I'll have it delivered to him discreetly.</string>
  <string id="6129809">Good luck on your expedition, my friend. We shall meet again.</string>
  <string id="6129811">Forget it.</string>
  <string id="6129812">I'm not interested in any help.</string>
  <string id="6129815">If Bartrand doesn't want your help, neither do I.</string>
  <string id="6129818">I can smell a rotten deal from twenty paces. No thanks.</string>
  <string id="6129821">Think you can come up with the coin all on your own, eh? Fair enough.</string>
  <string id="6129824">Hawke will find a way.</string>
  <string id="6129827">We'll find a way on our own.</string>
  <string id="6129833">There are plenty of ways to get what we need.</string>
  <string id="6129836">Really? From what I can tell, it seems your friend enjoys spending coin more than saving it.</string>
  <string id="6129839">You change your mind, come talk to me. I doubt this expedition is going anywhere in the meantime.</string>
  <string id="6129844">Were you looking for me? Nothing's wrong, is it?</string>
  <string id="6129845">I don't come to the alienage for my health.</string>
  <string id="6129846">Of course I was.</string>
  <string id="6129847">Nothing's the matter. I thought I'd see how you were doing.</string>
  <string id="6129848">I just wanted to see you.</string>
  <string id="6129849">I'm sure something is wrong somewhere in Kirkwall, but right now it can wait.</string>
  <string id="6129850">Not yet.</string>
  <string id="6129852">The city is crawling with templars. You're in danger every time you leave the house.</string>
  <string id="6129853">Don't go without telling me.</string>
  <string id="6129854">What brought you back down here?</string>
  <string id="6129855">Is something the matter?</string>
  <string id="6129856">Merrill, is there anything that doesn't make you nervous? Flowers and bunnies, maybe?</string>
  <string id="6129857">Worried about worrying me?</string>
  <string id="6129877">I'm sorry, Gascard. When my wife died, I lost all hope. I wasn't able to be the mentor you deserved.</string>
  <string id="6129880">They never pay attention to elves. Nothing happened.</string>
  <string id="6129881">It's probably better we don't discuss it. I don't want to fight with you.</string>
  <string id="6129882">What about poison flowers? Or... or... dire bunnies?</string>
  <string id="6129888">I'm... still trying to make it work. The mirror, I mean. I'm so close.</string>
  <string id="6129897">Checking up on me? I suppose you think I might summon an army of demons at any moment.</string>
  <string id="6129900">And I'm being a poor host, as usual.</string>
  <string id="6129906">The other day in the Lowtown market, I thought I saw Mahariel, impossible as that is. The lost Warden...</string>
  <string id="6129907">In the market the other day, out of the corner of my eye... I thought I saw Tamlen. I blinked, and he was gone.</string>
  <string id="6129912">I don't know what it meant. Maybe nothing. Maybe I'm going mad. I miss them all. Even the Keeper.</string>
  <string id="6129913">Nothing is stopping you from going to see them.</string>
  <string id="6129914">So visit them.</string>
  <string id="6129915">I'm sure the Keeper would like to see you again.</string>
  <string id="6129916">They probably miss you, too.</string>
  <string id="6129917">You miss Keeper Marethari? Are you feverish? Did you take a blow to the head?</string>
  <string id="6129918">You must be going mad.</string>
  <string id="6129919">I made my choice. I left.</string>
  <string id="6129920">I'm sure she would. She loves to lecture. I bet her new First appreciates that.</string>
  <string id="6129921">I must have! I even miss her scolding me.</string>
  <string id="6129928">I wish I could have seen... it doesn't matter. I'm here now.</string>
  <string id="6129931">Maybe Varric was right. Shall we go out for a bit? I could use some sunshine.</string>
  <string id="6129937">Elgar'nan, six years in this place, and I still can't fix the holes in the roof.</string>
  <string id="6129941">Willful... stubborn... idiot! All of this is my fault!</string>
  <string id="6129981">I... I've done everything wrong.</string>
  <string id="6129982">Yes, you did. Now move forward, and do better.</string>
  <string id="6129983">Learn from this.</string>
  <string id="6129984">Is there anything I can do?</string>
  <string id="6129985">I'm sorry, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6129986">I'm still here. Kirkwall isn't a pile of rubble. You've done a few things right.</string>
  <string id="6129987">Not everything.</string>
  <string id="6129999">I will. Starting now.</string>
  <string id="6130000">Ma vhenan, if I live to be a thousand, I'll never do enough to deserve you.</string>
  <string id="6130001">Only the Creators know how I haven't driven you away.</string>
  <string id="6130006">There is. You can stand back.</string>
  <string id="6130011">That's sheer luck.</string>
  <string id="6130014">I should have done this years ago.</string>
  <string id="6130020">You were right. You were always right.</string>
  <string id="6130043">She's gone. She's really gone...</string>
  <string id="6130046">Merrill?</string>
  <string id="6130049">How did all of this happen?</string>
  <string id="6130050">Fear did more damage to your clan than blood magic ever could.</string>
  <string id="6130051">The Keeper was stupid.</string>
  <string id="6130052">I know it doesn't help to hear it, but this was just a misunderstanding.</string>
  <string id="6130053">It's not your fault.</string>
  <string id="6130054">I don't think beating yourself up over what happened will bring Marethari back.</string>
  <string id="6130055">Don't dwell on it.</string>
  <string id="6130066">You're right.</string>
  <string id="6130067">Why didn't any of them listen to me?</string>
  <string id="6130068">No, but she'd want me to kick myself a few times, at least.</string>
  <string id="6130069">You know, I'm starting to think Sandal is watching me...</string>
  <string id="6130076">All this time, I thought... I could help them. Save them.</string>
  <string id="6130079">But they won't let me, will they? They'll destroy themselves to escape my help.</string>
  <string id="6130080">If they don't want to benefit from what you're doing, I'm sure someone else will.</string>
  <string id="6130081">Forget that clan.</string>
  <string id="6130082">You can't help people without their consent. I'm sorry, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6130083">You can't save them.</string>
  <string id="6130084">They might ruin themselves, but I'm sure they'll feel very self-righteous about it.</string>
  <string id="6130085">More than likely.</string>
  <string id="6130086">I never thought about...</string>
  <string id="6130087">No, I suppose I can't. All the time I've wasted...</string>
  <string id="6130088">They wouldn't be Dalish, otherwise.</string>
  <string id="6130095">Maybe... maybe it's time I stopped living for them.</string>
  <string id="6130098">Does all this feel like a dream to you, too?</string>
  <string id="6130099">Don't get distracted now.</string>
  <string id="6130100">This is real.</string>
  <string id="6130101">I can't believe it's come to this.</string>
  <string id="6130102">A little bit.</string>
  <string id="6130103">In a moment, I'll look down and see I have no pants on.</string>
  <string id="6130104">I think I've had this dream.</string>
  <string id="6130105">I'm ready for... whatever comes.</string>
  <string id="6130112">I won't. I... promise I won't let you down this time.</string>
  <string id="6130113">You'll get us through this. You always do.</string>
  <string id="6130114">Laughs The Champion of Kirkwall going to battle naked... why can't I ever have that dream?</string>
  <string id="6130125">My love...</string>
  <string id="6130126">Hawke, before we go... I...</string>
  <string id="6130127">This isn't the end.</string>
  <string id="6130128">Don't say it.</string>
  <string id="6130129">I love you. Whatever happens, remember that.</string>
  <string id="6130130">I know.</string>
  <string id="6130131">Save that thought for after we win.</string>
  <string id="6130132">Tell me after the battle.</string>
  <string id="6130133">We're coming back. That's a promise.</string>
  <string id="6130134">No goodbyes.</string>
  <string id="6130135">Merrill, whatever happens, I'm proud to have known you.</string>
  <string id="6130136">It's been an honor.</string>
  <string id="6130137">Haven't I said you worry too much? We'll be fine. Come on.</string>
  <string id="6130138">Quit worrying.</string>
  <string id="6130956">Why, hello again! Lovely home you have here. And may I say your mother makes for delightful company?</string>
  <string id="6130957">I thought we settled our business, Dougal.</string>
  <string id="6130958">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="6130959">You've done business with this man?</string>
  <string id="6130962">Just a simple transaction, serah. A quick talk, and I'll be on my way.</string>
  <string id="6130965">He hasn't been bothering you, has he?</string>
  <string id="6130966">Mother, are you okay?</string>
  <string id="6130967">I'll be less bothered when he leaves.</string>
  <string id="6130970">My apologies, serah. Your son and I simply have a bit of business to conclude.</string>
  <string id="6130973">My apologies, serah. Your daughter and I simply have a bit of business to conclude.</string>
  <string id="6130976">Another visitor! We've moved up in the world, Mother.</string>
  <string id="6130977">We're friendly people.</string>
  <string id="6130978">Evidently so.</string>
  <string id="6130981">I'll leave you two alone, then. Be careful.</string>
  <string id="6130987">Darling woman. Shame that she spends so much time here alone.</string>
  <string id="6130988">Just what are you saying?</string>
  <string id="6130989">Is that a threat?</string>
  <string id="6130990">Perhaps you haven't met my dog.</string>
  <string id="6130991">She's not alone.</string>
  <string id="6130992">The mabari are such a lovely breed.</string>
  <string id="6130995">Bodahn is here, as well as Sandal.</string>
  <string id="6130996">She's not alone.</string>
  <string id="6130997">Yes, your manservant and his idiot son. I met them.</string>
  <string id="6131000">She fills her days making poisons... and cake. Tell me you didn't try the cake.</string>
  <string id="6131001">Mother's dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6131002">Laughs Good thing I just had the tea, then?</string>
  <string id="6131005">Allow me to get right to the point: I know all this came from Deep Roads treasure.</string>
  <string id="6131006">Did the player make a deal with Dougal in act 1?</string>
  <string id="6131007">Yes</string>
  <string id="6131008">Yes</string>
  <string id="6131009">Jump to act 2.</string>
  <string id="6131010">Go!</string>
  <string id="6131011">Go!</string>
  <string id="6131012">No.</string>
  <string id="6131013">No.</string>
  <string id="6131060">Aveline</string>
  <string id="6131069">You don't like the gift, then?</string>
  <string id="6131070">Not exactly romantic, then.</string>
  <string id="6131074">Dear Maker, please help Revin find his way to me. After his grandfather and mother died, he's all I have left.</string>
  <string id="6131077">That note mentioned the Gem of Keroshek. What's that?</string>
  <string id="6131092">I lost everything chasing that gem... our fortune, our home, even Mara.</string>
  <string id="6131093">He has my mother. Get between me and him, and I will kill you.</string>
  <string id="6131094">Eager to die, Gascard?</string>
  <string id="6131097">If Guardsman Donnic is walking into a trap, we need to be there. Soon.</string>
  <string id="6131098">The strangest thing, this mess. I can't concentrate on much else. Captain Jeven just... confuses me.</string>
  <string id="6131099">Who's Mara?</string>
  <string id="6131100">Mara?</string>
  <string id="6131101">I would have put our wealth into something profitable like Orlesian wigs or nug-skin coats.</string>
  <string id="6131102">Not the wisest investment.</string>
  <string id="6131103">That's where our fortune went?</string>
  <string id="6131104">Lost everything?</string>
  <string id="6131105">Our? Get this, you self-righteous ass: you got no claim on that coin.</string>
  <string id="6131108">Why don't you head back to your fancy house in Hightown and stay out of my damned business?</string>
  <string id="6131116">Well, look who's here.</string>
  <string id="6131119">I knew it.</string>
  <string id="6131122">Dougal.</string>
  <string id="6131125">It turns out we'll need to do this the hard way, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6131128">I'll get the money you owe me if I have to tear your mansion apart brick by brick.</string>
  <string id="6131129">For the last time, Dougal: we're done.</string>
  <string id="6131130">Just try it.</string>
  <string id="6131131">We are now.</string>
  <string id="6131132">It's not too late, Dougal. It doesn't have to come to a fight.</string>
  <string id="6131133">We can talk this out.</string>
  <string id="6131134">So you thought an ambush would get you what you want?</string>
  <string id="6131135">You think this is a good idea?</string>
  <string id="6131136">I considered going after your mother, but I prefer the direct approach.</string>
  <string id="6131139">Boys! Let's make this quick. I want to be in that mansion within the hour!</string>
  <string id="6131144">I know you repaid me, but I think I deserve a larger share of your fortune. Fair's fair, right?</string>
  <string id="6131145">I kept my end of the bargain. Now get out.</string>
  <string id="6131146">Piss off.</string>
  <string id="6131148">We took all the risks, and I paid you back.</string>
  <string id="6131149">Why do you deserve more?</string>
  <string id="6131150">Isn't this a conversation we should have had, say, three years ago?</string>
  <string id="6131151">Little late for that, no?</string>
  <string id="6131152">What can I say? Things have gone poorly for me, and I'm a bitter man.</string>
  <string id="6131155">Give me another, oh, hundred sovereigns, and I'll go away. If you don't, I'll make things unpleasant. Simple enough, no?</string>
  <string id="6131156">What do you mean by that?</string>
  <string id="6131157">Unpleasant how?</string>
  <string id="6131158">Well, let's see. I think people would like to know just what happened to Bartrand, wouldn't they?</string>
  <string id="6131161">I know he betrayed you, but nobody else does. Your partner disappears, and you end up rich?</string>
  <string id="6131162">There hasn't been a single question asked about that.</string>
  <string id="6131163">Nobody cares about Bartrand!</string>
  <string id="6131164">Yet.</string>
  <string id="6131167">Questions could be asked. About you, about your red-headed friend in the city guard, about your sudden riches.</string>
  <string id="6131170">Help me out and my friends in the Carta will make sure the evidence I have never sees the light of day.</string>
  <string id="6131171">You walk into my home and start making threats?</string>
  <string id="6131172">How dare you.</string>
  <string id="6131173">Er, well, I...</string>
  <string id="6131176">Do you have any idea what I went through to get here?</string>
  <string id="6131179">Get out! Before I decide to show you just how laughable your threats really are.</string>
  <string id="6131182">F-fine! I'll go! But you haven't heard the last of me, Hawke!</string>
  <string id="6131183">Here. Now get out.</string>
  <string id="6131186">If this will satisfy you, then here.</string>
  <string id="6131189">Just extortion? Here I thought it was something serious.</string>
  <string id="6131192">Huh. It seems you've done better than I thought.</string>
  <string id="6131195">Fair enough, my friend. Give my kind wishes to your mother. I'm sure we won't be seeing each other again.</string>
  <string id="6131198">I don't have that kind of coin on me right now.</string>
  <string id="6131199">I'll need time.</string>
  <string id="6131200">Ah, yes. I've heard that line before, I think.</string>
  <string id="6131203">We had a deal. I kept it.</string>
  <string id="6131206">And what's going to keep you from coming back for more?</string>
  <string id="6131209">Let's see... do I respond well to threats? I don't think I do.</string>
  <string id="6131212">Pity.</string>
  <string id="6131215">Have it your way, Hawke. We'll be seeing each other again, I'm sure.</string>
  <string id="6131218">For a while it looked like we were the only ones to escape the darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6131219">How did you survive the horde?</string>
  <string id="6131220">We aren't free of them yet. You didn't see Ostagar. This is just the start.</string>
  <string id="6131223">You were there? Yes, I see it now. Third company, under Captain Varel.</string>
  <string id="6131226">Then you saw how the whole of the army was defeated.</string>
  <string id="6131229">We fell to betrayal, not the darkspawn. This arm of the horde will not have the same advantage.</string>
  <string id="6131230">We aren't free of them yet. Just like at Ostagar, this is just the start.</string>
  <string id="6131253">And now, Gascard, you will be the first to behold my greatest achievement.</string>
  <string id="6131259">You're right. This is monstrous.</string>
  <string id="6131262">I've been so careful in all my dealings with spirits until now. To make such an obvious mistake...</string>
  <string id="6131265">It frightens me. It takes so little for a mage to fall.</string>
  <string id="6131273">I... I'm sorry, Quentin, but I can't...</string>
  <string id="6131288">Strange Hunter</string>
  <string id="6131292">Dwarf Mercenary</string>
  <string id="6131311">Templar Archer</string>
  <string id="6131315">Templar Hunter</string>
  <string id="6131323">I may benefit more, that's true, but don't be shy about taking your credit.</string>
  <string id="6131328">Don't worry. I will not ask your aid again.</string>
  <string id="6131331">She's here. She's waiting for you.</string>
  <string id="6131342">All of the Amaranthine conspirators were killed. Sergeant Joanna has returned to Vigil's Keep.</string>
  <string id="6131346">What do you do to protect yourself from demons?</string>
  <string id="6131347">How do you defend against it?</string>
  <string id="6131348">You could have killed Feynriel, or me, or become an abomination.</string>
  <string id="6131349">You put us all at risk.</string>
  <string id="6131350">You're already in a lot more danger than most mages.</string>
  <string id="6131351">Be more careful, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6131352">So you know the demon thing is crazy and you do it anyway. Just as long as you're worried about it.</string>
  <string id="6131353">Oh, that's reassuring.</string>
  <string id="6131354">Alrik's Papers</string>
  <string id="6131356">Did I ask for that? I don't know who sent it, and I don't want to.</string>
  <string id="6131359">She's... none of your concern, that's who she is!</string>
  <string id="6131364">Pride's End</string>
  <string id="6131368">Sundermount</string>
  <string id="6131375">Strange Idol</string>
  <string id="6131378">Do you know what the strongest force in the universe is?</string>
  <string id="6131381">Love.</string>
  <string id="6131384">I loved her so much I couldn't let her go.</string>
  <string id="6131390">Not even after the templars killed her.</string>
  <string id="6131394">You're quick to offer your allegiance.</string>
  <string id="6131395">Can you be trusted?</string>
  <string id="6131396">Another blade between us and the darkspawn? Yes please.</string>
  <string id="6131399">So long as the horde is their first concern.</string>
  <string id="6131404">Sophia Dryden</string>
  <string id="6131409">I pieced her together from memory. I found her eyes, her skin, her delicate fingers...</string>
  <string id="6131412">And at last, her face... oh, this beautiful face.</string>
  <string id="6131546">Sergeant Joanna</string>
  <string id="6131551">Guard</string>
  <string id="6131555">I've searched far and wide to find you again, beloved, and no force on this earth will part us.</string>
  <string id="6131561">What made you give in?</string>
  <string id="6131562">How did it control you?</string>
  <string id="6131564">One conspirator was killed. Three remain.</string>
  <string id="6131565">Two conspirators were killed. Two remain.</string>
  <string id="6131566">Three conspirators were killed. One remains.</string>
  <string id="6131567">All of the conspirators were killed. Return to Sergeant Joanna in Lowtown before nightfall.</string>
  <string id="6131571">We were beginning to think you wouldn't show.</string>
  <string id="6131574">It's rude to keep people waiting, you know. It's not like I don't got things to do.</string>
  <string id="6131575">To inconvenience an upstanding citizen such as yourself! My, where are my manners?</string>
  <string id="6131576">I humbly apologize.</string>
  <string id="6131577">I think you have me mistaken for someone else. I don't know you.</string>
  <string id="6131578">Sorry, who are you?</string>
  <string id="6131579">You're wasting my time.</string>
  <string id="6131580">You think I care?</string>
  <string id="6131592">See, we was hired to give you a note.</string>
  <string id="6131595">But this Gem of Keroshek thing the note talks about? We decided we want that instead.</string>
  <string id="6131598">You better hand it over.</string>
  <string id="6131599">I was told to come here to get the gem. Why would you think I have it?</string>
  <string id="6131600">You think we have it?</string>
  <string id="6131601">I'm surprised you know what a note is, let alone know how to read one.</string>
  <string id="6131602">You can read?</string>
  <string id="6131603">You have three seconds before I start slicing off your toes.</string>
  <string id="6131604">Hand over that note.</string>
  <string id="6131606">The Blight is over. You could go back to Lothering.</string>
  <string id="6131607">Would you return to Ferelden?</string>
  <string id="6131614">That wasn't home for me. It was just where the horde pressed us.</string>
  <string id="6131618">Go back</string>
  <string id="6131619">Go back</string>
  <string id="6131622">Amaranthine Conspirator</string>
  <string id="6131627">You have it, or you can take us to who does. That's what I think.</string>
  <string id="6131628">Don't need to know how to read, all I need to know is which end of the sword goes where.</string>
  <string id="6131629">Laughs You wasn't listening. We want the gem, even if we got to kill you for it.</string>
  <string id="6131636">Murdered? No... it's not true. I don't believe it.</string>
  <string id="6131637">I'm not you. I can't just shove my grief into a corner and never look at it again.</string>
  <string id="6131640">You can say that over and over, but it won't change anything.</string>
  <string id="6131641">Denial doesn't help.</string>
  <string id="6131642">Where's the one who did this to her? Did you find the person who killed Leandra?</string>
  <string id="6131654">You were right about the flowers and everything. I... I can't believe she's gone.</string>
  <string id="6131878">Let's just say his killing days are over.</string>
  <string id="6131881">I killed him. I avenged Mother.</string>
  <string id="6131884">Good. I hope it hurt.</string>
  <string id="6131885">He's dead.</string>
  <string id="6131888">It won't bring Leandra back, but I'll take comfort in knowing that.</string>
  <string id="6131889">You know, not every gift has the significance of finely crafted copper marigolds.</string>
  <string id="6131892">I never said any of that. You made this an attack, not me.</string>
  <string id="6131895">Just a shield.</string>
  <string id="6131898">You have very bad taste. Every smith in Orlais stamps Ser Aveline's name on their exports.</string>
  <string id="6131901">But thank you. For the thought.</string>
  <string id="6131906">Sobs Why her? Why Leandra?</string>
  <string id="6131907">The killer used Mother to magically reconstruct his dead wife.</string>
  <string id="6131908">She looked like someone.</string>
  <string id="6131909">Mother's gone. Will knowing why ease the pain?</string>
  <string id="6131910">It doesn't matter.</string>
  <string id="6131911">No, it won't. It will always seem senseless, won't it?</string>
  <string id="6131916">What sort of nightmarish magic is that? Oh, Maker...</string>
  <string id="6131919">Magic's always run in this family. It's a curse. Now even your mother's fallen victim to it.</string>
  <string id="6131937">You once saved me. I owe you a life, but this is the cost.</string>
  <string id="6131940">Whatever you become, whatever cause you claim or deny... you are nothing to me.</string>
  <string id="6131943">Goodbye, Hawke. Live as you choose.</string>
  <string id="6131960">Maybe the templars are right. Lock the mages up! Throw away the key!</string>
  <string id="6131961">Do you want them to lock me up too, Uncle?</string>
  <string id="6131962">What about me?</string>
  <string id="6131963">You're happy they took Bethany away?</string>
  <string id="6131964">What about Bethany?</string>
  <string id="6131965">I'm glad Bethany died before she could hear you say that.</string>
  <string id="6131966">What would Bethany say?</string>
  <string id="6131967">Magic didn't kill Mother. A madman did. He could have just as easily killed her with a knife.</string>
  <string id="6131968">Magic's not to blame.</string>
  <string id="6131969">Mages have always been trouble. They will always be trouble.</string>
  <string id="6131970">You're right.</string>
  <string id="6131977">I wish you'd never told me what that twisted son of a bitch did to her. I wish I hadn't asked.</string>
  <string id="6132464">No further, Champion! Guard-Captain!</string>
  <string id="6132470">You will order your men to attack in support!</string>
  <string id="6132473">Do you hear me?</string>
  <string id="6132487">Guardsmen! You will attack on my order!</string>
  <string id="6132493">Weaklings!</string>
  <string id="6132496">Knights! Attack!</string>
  <string id="6132640">It's a fine suit.</string>
  <string id="6132643">The finest.</string>
  <string id="6132646">Break it down. Distribute it.</string>
  <string id="6132649">The viscount requires parade armor for his inspections.</string>
  <string id="6132652">Then stuff and mount it where he can see it. I wear the uniform of the guard.</string>
  <string id="6132655">His Excellency will not be pleased.</string>
  <string id="6132658">His Excellency can mount it.</string>
  <string id="6132664">Trouble, Hawke?</string>
  <string id="6132667">The captain should know, shouldn't she?</string>
  <string id="6132670">Seems like you have enough.</string>
  <string id="6132673">You say that like you expect it.</string>
  <string id="6132676">You don't know the half of it.</string>
  <string id="6132679">And why don't you, by the way? Why aren't you tail deep in the problems of this city?</string>
  <string id="6132682">Sure, you do good, but petition a title, take a job. The guard is always looking.</string>
  <string id="6132713">Maybe I'm just sick of being the first stop for complaints about people like you.</string>
  <string id="6132716">People like me?</string>
  <string id="6132719">Bran's on about fortune hunters. Mercenaries. Disreputable professions without purpose.</string>
  <string id="6132722">He's a clod, but sometimes... well, it might be good if the city was a little more stable.</string>
  <string id="6132723">Come on now, you'd really prefer the troublemakers stay home?</string>
  <string id="6132724">You'd be bored.</string>
  <string id="6132725">All right, so maybe I don't want to be completely put out of business. And I don't even really mean you.</string>
  <string id="6132728">But some people, they go on without regard and then act surprised when someone starts a Circle.</string>
  <string id="6132731">There are warning signs, you know? It's worth saying.</string>
  <string id="6132734">One Gallows is enough, Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6132735">Like they stabilize mages?</string>
  <string id="6132736">What? No, I didn't mean... I would never take the guards to those extremes.</string>
  <string id="6132739">It has to start somewhere.</string>
  <string id="6132742">I don't think it's quite that inevitable, but perhaps we'll just have to disagree.</string>
  <string id="6132745">Don't blame me for not being you. I'd make a poor guard.</string>
  <string id="6132746">You're the captain, not me.</string>
  <string id="6132747">Well, we agree on that. I don't really see you taking my orders.</string>
  <string id="6132750">Besides, there's no doubt you have an effect now. You're the Champion.</string>
  <string id="6132753">Some nobles won't leave their estates unless they match what you're wearing that day.</string>
  <string id="6132756">Some nobles won't shift their britches without checking which way you dress that morning.</string>
  <string id="6132759">Besides, you won't catch me saying you don't have an effect. You've certainly had one on Hightown.</string>
  <string id="6132762">But?</string>
  <string id="6132765">Maybe it's time to get serious. Before the option isn't your own.</string>
  <string id="6132766">You don't want me as sour and dour as you. You need a counterpoint.</string>
  <string id="6132767">You need my good humor.</string>
  <string id="6132768">I don't think I've asked to be made the butt of your jokes.</string>
  <string id="6132771">Donnic.</string>
  <string id="6132774">Okay, sometimes I have asked for it.</string>
  <string id="6132777">I do wish there was more time for... levity. It comes so easy to you.</string>
  <string id="6132780">Maybe a little too easy. That's all I'm saying.</string>
  <string id="6132783">Not in so many words.</string>
  <string id="6132786">When you go on about regret, it's never really about me.</string>
  <string id="6132787">You're whining about yourself.</string>
  <string id="6132788">I don't think that's fair.</string>
  <string id="6132791">Think about your next words, and ask yourself if I even need to be in the room.</string>
  <string id="6132794">Well. Maybe you don't.</string>
  <string id="6132809">I'm up to my tail in thieves, cheats... Bran. I don't need you in here, too.</string>
  <string id="6132812">Go have fun or something. There's work to do.</string>
  <string id="6132813">Save the posturing for Bran. You enjoy trailing me.</string>
  <string id="6132814">You complain while helping me.</string>
  <string id="6132815">Sometimes. But you're becoming a problem.</string>
  <string id="6132818">One you allow.</string>
  <string id="6132821">You shouldn't be so eager to test that. I give you less special treatment than you think.</string>
  <string id="6132824">There's a lot of pressure to make the city guard more like the templars. Cage potential troublemakers just in case.</string>
  <string id="6132827">Can't imagine you'd like that.</string>
  <string id="6132828">You're not one of those order at any cost people, Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6132829">Neither would you.</string>
  <string id="6132830">And what would you know about it?</string>
  <string id="6132833">That wasn't a taunt. We spar a bit, but we both have limits.</string>
  <string id="6132836">And the templars do not. Is that it? It wasn't always like that.</string>
  <string id="6132839">Point taken, Hawke. And I'm not used to you being reasonable. It's nice.</string>
  <string id="6132842">You'd be a fool to try it. People would revolt.</string>
  <string id="6132843">A stupid provocation.</string>
  <string id="6132844">Criminals would revolt.</string>
  <string id="6132847">They aren't people? How big would your Gallows be?</string>
  <string id="6132850">That's not fair. I'd never... not intentionally.</string>
  <string id="6132853">Ugh! There you go again, seeding your little doubts. As If I don't have enough. Just.. leave, all right?</string>
  <string id="6132856">That's a bit harsh, given my record.</string>
  <string id="6132857">I thought I was doing well.</string>
  <string id="6132858">Station doesn't get you an exemption from the law. Not even for the Champion.</string>
  <string id="6132861">Station doesn't get you an exemption from the law.</string>
  <string id="6132864">That would shock a lot of people.</string>
  <string id="6132867">I'm aware that enforcement is lacking in certain circles, thanks. That doesn't mean you get to do what you want.</string>
  <string id="6132870">Stability is important. You're tipping the table with your little adventures.</string>
  <string id="6132871">I don't hear you complaining while you're out with me.</string>
  <string id="6132872">Our adventures, you mean.</string>
  <string id="6132873">Yes, you bloody well do!</string>
  <string id="6132876">Maybe. The point is, you still come. So I'm not the worst you've seen.</string>
  <string id="6132879">No. No, you're not.</string>
  <string id="6132882">All right, so maybe a little tipping isn't that bad. Comparatively. Just... try not to look so smug about it, all right?</string>
  <string id="6132885">And so you know, you could be this reasonable more often. It's... nice.</string>
  <string id="6132888">This city doesn't do much for people who ask nicely.</string>
  <string id="6132889">I need what I need.</string>
  <string id="6132890">Don't make this come to a head. I've got a city to think about. I care too much to let it get that far.</string>
  <string id="6132893">Are you sure it’s care and not control?</string>
  <string id="6132896">Sometimes they're the same thing.</string>
  <string id="6132899">I don't think we're going to agree on much today, Hawke. And that troubles me.</string>
  <string id="6132926">I think our relationship is pretty complementary.</string>
  <string id="6132927">I'm doing you a favor.</string>
  <string id="6132928">Involving me in petty crime is somehow helpful? </string>
  <string id="6132931">What good is an untested oath? That's just a slogan.</string>
  <string id="6132934">There's no end of those in this office... and higher. Every last one, brave on paper.</string>
  <string id="6132937">Ill give you that one, Hawke. Oddly well-considered for you.</string>
  <string id="6132940">I don't suppose it will last.</string>
  <string id="6132975">A pouch of Andraste's ashes!</string>
  <string id="6132981">Verified by the scholar Genitivi, these ashes cure any ailment. And provides virility in more intimate matters.</string>
  <string id="6132984">Do I have a volunteer?</string>
  <string id="6132987">Coughs I-I'll try.</string>
  <string id="6132990">Just a small pinch, serah. There you go.</string>
  <string id="6132993">Breathes My cough. It's gone!</string>
  <string id="6132999">Cured by the Maker himself!</string>
  <string id="6133002">That's enough! Clear out, you charlatans!</string>
  <string id="6133012">The coin should be delivered to you shortly.</string>
  <string id="6133013">You'll get it.</string>
  <string id="6133017">Every coin those swindlers nab goes straight to the Carta's coffers. They must be stopped!</string>
  <string id="6133019">Those miscreants have made a lot of people angry. If they met an untimely end, I'm certain us simple guards would never figure it out.</string>
  <string id="6133020">Don't say I didn't warn you.</string>
  <string id="6133024">Not a step closer. No refunds on the ashes, friend. If the Maker doesn't favor you, that's between you and Him, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6133032">Perhaps you missed the part where I was once a slave. Do you really think I will stand by and watch you become that girl's new master?</string>
  <string id="6133033">How about I become her employer, then. Better?</string>
  <string id="6133034">Fine, I'll pay her.</string>
  <string id="6133035">Barely.</string>
  <string id="6133039">Do you want help or not?</string>
  <string id="6133040">Oh, I'm sorry. I missed the part where I do everything you command.</string>
  <string id="6133043">I can leave you to deal with Hadriana yourself if you prefer.</string>
  <string id="6133046">Vishante kaffas! Spits</string>
  <string id="6133050">What else will she do?</string>
  <string id="6133051">You heard her. She has no idea how to live on her own.</string>
  <string id="6133054">And let's keep her that way, yes? Spits</string>
  <string id="6133057">You're right. She's clearly more suited to a life of freedom and luxury!</string>
  <string id="6133060">Yes, far better to take advantage because she is too stupid to know better.</string>
  <string id="6133063">Keep your slave, then. Enjoy her.</string>
  <string id="6133066">Orana isn't you, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6133067">What else will she do?</string>
  <string id="6133068">I know that.</string>
  <string id="6133071">Do you? You really think that every slave can live free and survive like you have?</string>
  <string id="6133074">Fine. Keep your slave. I hope your new status pleases you.</string>
  <string id="6133079">I... I don't know. Sighs You would've been better off if you were just normal, like Carver.</string>
  <string id="6133082">No... I didn't mean it like that.</string>
  <string id="6133085">Sighs I wish magic hadn't touched her. She would've been better off.</string>
  <string id="6133088">A night walk in Lowtown. Let's go make sure his quiet patrol stays that way.</string>
  <string id="6133091">Don't talk down to me. I ain't stupid.</string>
  <string id="6133094">You don't got to know me. You just got to listen. </string>
  <string id="6133095">Miracle Makers</string>
  <string id="6133100">We aren't going anywhere without that gem.</string>
  <string id="6133102">Eliminate the Carta swindlers operating in Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6133103">The Carta swindlers were killed. Return to Sergeant Melindra in the Lowtown market before nightfall for a reward.</string>
  <string id="6133105">The Carta swindlers are dead, and Sergeant Melindra is pleased.</string>
  <string id="6133109">Those charlatans won't be bothering anyone again.</string>
  <string id="6133112">Did you say something? I didn't hear you. And clumsy me, I seem to have dropped a coin purse in your hand.</string>
  <string id="6133115">You said she was... used! This goes beyond just murder. It... it's desecration!</string>
  <string id="6133120">I hope you killed him.</string>
  <string id="6133132">I will deal with breaking the news to Bethany. You've enough on your mind.</string>
  <string id="6133133">Bethany needs to be told. I'll send a message. Hopefully it will reach her, wherever she is.</string>
  <string id="6133137">You've had a long day, so I'll go to the Gallows to talk to Carver. He'll need to know about this.</string>
  <string id="6133138">Carver needs to be told. I'll send a message to the Grey Wardens and hope it reaches him.</string>
  <string id="6133139">I should talk to the city guard. Make arrangements to retrieve Leandra—Leandra's body.</string>
  <string id="6133140">I doubt the mystery of who killed those swindlers will ever be solved.</string>
  <string id="6133141">You've met him?</string>
  <string id="6133142">The Keeper taught me... in the Fade you must believe nothing but yourself.</string>
  <string id="6133143">It felt like... every word the demon spoke reached out and pulled at my heart.</string>
  <string id="6133144">But I didn't! You stopped me, and put things right.</string>
  <string id="6133145">Because of... the blood magic. I know. I'll be more guarded from now on.</string>
  <string id="6133146">All magic is dangerous. It always attracts... attention.  All mages know this.</string>
  <string id="6133147">What would you like to do?</string>
  <string id="6133148">Plot</string>
  <string id="6133149">Plot</string>
  <string id="6133150">Which Plot?</string>
  <string id="6133151">Fools Rush In - Act 1</string>
  <string id="6133152">Fools Rush In - Act 1</string>

  <string id="6133312">He still hasn't returned?</string>
  <string id="6133315">You can't bring her back, Merrill. Just accept it.</string>
  <string id="6133318">You can't bring Tamlen back. Maybe it's time you stopped trying.</string>
  <string id="6133321">I... never mind. There's no use in discussing this.</string>
  <string id="6133326">Not yet. I promise you, if I see him, you'll be the first to know.</string>
  <string id="6133346">If you would, keep an eye out for our hunters. Many have gone out and not returned.</string>
  <string id="6133349">We shouldn't even be here! If anything has happened to Harshal...</string>
  <string id="6133352">Don't. There's no need to panic yet.</string>
  <string id="6133373">Ugh. At least the crates are numbered so we can find them fast.</string>
  <string id="6133374">You mind if I just sit here while you search for the crates?</string>
  <string id="6133375">Fish, fish and more fish. Pfaugh! Let's look for those crates.</string>
  <string id="6133376">Those crates are somewhere in this warehouse.</string>

  <string id="6133451">Are you sure she didn't say where she was going?</string>

  <string id="6133457">The vhenadahl tree is where we need to go.</string>
  <string id="6133458">The tree that mallet was made from is here in the alienage.</string>
  <string id="6133459">Isn't that sacred-tree-thing we wanted here in the alienage?</string>
  <string id="6133460">Let's go see if this vhenadahl tree can give us any answers.</string>
  <string id="6133461">The vhenadahl tree is here in the alienage. </string>
  <string id="6133500">I'm surprised they sent so many men just to capture someone like Gamlen.</string>
  <string id="6133501">Come on! Let's go search for those crates!</string>
  <string id="6133506">So they were to capture Gamlen and take him to the caverns? Sounds like the opening of a bad romance story.</string>
  <string id="6133510">Let me guess: that's your final answer?</string>
  <string id="6133513">You declare your Circle of Magi free, as if it were your right to do so, and thus stir up every mage outside of your kingdom.</string>
  <string id="6133516">Three mages have fled to Ferelden, and you have intervened to protect them as if it is your right to do so.</string>
  <string id="6133519">What other answer did you expect, your Majesty?</string>
  <string id="6133522">A maybe might have been nice.</string>
  <string id="6133525">I do not deal in maybes. I deal in cold, hard facts—as should you.</string>
  <string id="6133528">Perhaps when Ferelden next chooses a king, it will be one that takes his duty to the Maker seriously.</string>
  <string id="6133534">Well. That was awkward.</string>
  <string id="6133535">You asked to see me?</string>
  <string id="6133536">You called me here?</string>
  <string id="6133537">I did! Or I think I did, anyhow.</string>
  <string id="6133540">How do you do, your Majesty?</string>
  <string id="6133541">Greetings.</string>
  <string id="6133542">I've been better. Manlier too, come to think of it.</string>
  <string id="6133545">That's just Meredith's idea of Kirkwall hospitality.</string>
  <string id="6133546">Don't mind her.</string>
  <string id="6133547">Really? Kirkwall brutality must rip the skin off your face, then.</string>
  <string id="6133550">This is the Champion of Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6133553">Right! I'm Alistair, uh... king of Ferelden. And this is Teagan, my uncle. Sort of.</string>
  <string id="6133556">We've met—a few years back. Thank you again, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6133559">I'm actually Teagan. I'm only sort of his uncle.</string>
  <string id="6133565">Say... weren't you a Grey Warden once?</string>
  <string id="6133568">That's the rumor. Wait, weren't you...?</string>
  <string id="6133571">That's the rumor.</string>
  <string id="6133574">Huh. I guess we get around.</string>
  <string id="6133580">So you're a king, now? My, something new to brag about!</string>
  <string id="6133583">Isabela. Yes, I remember you.</string>
  <string id="6133586">I suppose borrowing you for the summer is out now?</string>
  <string id="6133589">So you're a king now? Moving up in the world!</string>
  <string id="6133592">Isabela, right? You look... different.</string>
  <string id="6133595">Don't we all?</string>
  <string id="6133598">I was hoping we could talk. Would've been better timing before being emasculated by Meredith, but I'm not picky.</string>
  <string id="6133599">If you want to talk, then talk.</string>
  <string id="6133600">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="6133601">I'm surprised you would even know who I am.</string>
  <string id="6133602">You know about me?</string>
  <string id="6133603">Things are looking up! It's not often I get called on to meet with foreign leaders.</string>
  <string id="6133604">An audience with a king?</string>
  <string id="6133608">I know you came here from Lothering. A Fereldan refugee that did well for himself, against all odds.</string>
  <string id="6133611">I know you came here from Lothering. A Fereldan refugee that did well for herself, against all odds.</string>
  <string id="6133623">I have to admit, I was hoping your influence in Kirkwall might be of use.</string>
  <string id="6133626">Things... haven't been going well with Orlais. Without a viscount here, however, there's only the knight-commander to deal with.</string>
  <string id="6133627">You were having an argument about mages?</string>
  <string id="6133628">Why was Meredith angry?</string>
  <string id="6133629">Is there to be a war, then?</string>

  <string id="6133672">It's your fault she's dead. You knew Quentin all along. You could've helped me stop this!</string>
  <string id="6133673">You killed her.</string>
  <string id="6133674">Tell me why I shouldn't rip you to shreds right here.</string>
  <string id="6133675">You don't deserve to live.</string>
  <string id="6133681">FirstName/&gt; Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
Many thanks for the kind return of my property. Fenris is his usual compliant self now that his memories have been once again removed. Not a simple process, but considering the investment, I consider it very much worthwhile.&#13;
&#13;
As promised, I'm enclosing a little gift from the storehouses of the Arcanist Hall in Minrathous. Should you ever find yourself in the Imperium, do feel free to visit. I'll provide a tour of the Hall myself, if you like.&#13;
&#13;

  <string id="6133682">Returning it? You're something else, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6133683">Our mother was... well, no word adequately describes an old dwarven lady's rage.</string>
  <string id="6133684">I'll throw in a couple of werewolves and a griffon for balance.</string>

  <string id="6133734">Who gave this to you?</string>
  <string id="6133735">This person is like an underpaid brothel wench. He enjoys leading us on.</string>
  <string id="6133736">Another note?</string>
  <string id="6133737">Get back to your tree, and leave me alone.</string>
  <string id="6133738">Did I say you can talk to me?</string>
  <string id="6133739">And you're welcome.</string>
  <string id="6133740">How was I supposed to know he was going to take your mother?</string>
  <string id="6133741">I can't even look at him. Aveline?</string>
  <string id="6133742">Help me here, Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6133746">Think carefully. If you knew Quentin meant to take her, would you have told us?</string>
  <string id="6133747">Fenris. What would you do to him?</string>
  <string id="6133748">Your turn, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6133752">That pain you feel is just the beginning, mage.</string>
  <string id="6133753">You're just saying that because you're afraid of me.</string>
  <string id="6133754">You're not sorry.</string>
  <string id="6133763">Well, maybe now my contact at the gates of Orzammar won't ignore my letters.</string>
  <string id="6133764">Well, I guess I better start answering my mail from Orzammar.</string>
  <string id="6133765">Unfortunately, the person was hooded, and it was dark. I didn't get a good look.</string>
  <string id="6133768">I was given a few coins to hand this over to whoever came asking about wallop mallets. </string>
  <string id="6133778">Yes, well, apparently I don't feel the same way about mages as the Chantry does.</string>
  <string id="6133781">So we're in disagreement. That means they get nasty. They're like that.</string>
  <string id="6133782">Sounds like the Circle is better off in Ferelden.</string>
  <string id="6133783">Mages have it better there?</string>
  <string id="6133784">You'd think so, wouldn't you?</string>
  <string id="6133787">Sadly, I don't control the Circle. I can only deal with mages outside the Circle... of which there aren't many.</string>
  <string id="6133788">Aren't they in your kingdom? Why not just kick the templars out?</string>
  <string id="6133789">So take over the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6133790">Ha! Easier said than done!</string>
  <string id="6133793">Doesn't mean you shouldn't try.</string>
  <string id="6133796">I'm sure there's something you can do.</string>
  <string id="6133799">Perhaps some things are better left alone.</string>
  <string id="6133802">We'll see what comes of it. Ferelden had a Blight to contend with, remember? We're not exactly at our strongest.</string>
  <string id="6133803">I hope not!</string>
  <string id="6133806">You're more optimistic than I am.</string>
  <string id="6133809">Empress Celene is doing her best. Orlais isn't the most stable place right now.</string>
  <string id="6133810">What's happening in Orlais?</string>
  <string id="6133811">Why is that?</string>
  <string id="6133812">Oh, the usual. Attempted assassinations, uprisings, fancy parties with stinky cheeses.</string>
  <string id="6133815">Apparently, some Orlesians think it would be grand to get their lost province back.</string>
  <string id="6133818">Well, we won't let them swoop down on us, will we?</string>
  <string id="6133821">That's right. Swooping is bad.</string>
  <string id="6133822">A lot of your people fled to Kirkwall, you know.</string>
  <string id="6133823">There are many Fereldans here.</string>
  <string id="6133824">I know. I wish I could have helped them.</string>
  <string id="6133827">The Blight devastated the kingdom, and afterwards... well, it hasn't exactly been peaceful.</string>
  <string id="6133830">They're welcome back, of course. As are you. But after so many years away, would you still consider it home?</string>
  <string id="6133832">How can I help?</string>
  <string id="6133833">You've done nothing for the Fereldans here, and now you want my help?</string>
  <string id="6133834">You have a lot of nerve.</string>
  <string id="6133836">I could be viscount.</string>
  <string id="6133849">Champion. I hope my letter found you well.</string>
  <string id="6133853">Harrowmont is hoping that if he just shuts his eyes tight and wishes, the real world will go away.</string>
  <string id="6133858">I swear, if I read one more page about golems...</string>
  <string id="6133861">Bhelen's court just reminds me too much of family dinners with my cousins.</string>
  <string id="6133864">Anyway, I owe you one, Hawke. Remind me later to put you on my tab.</string>
  <string id="6133865">It's not my fault! I didn't know he was going to take your mother!</string>
  <string id="6133871">Well?</string>
  <string id="6133874">N-no. I wouldn't have told you. I wanted to kill him on my own so I could keep his knowledge to myself.</string>
  <string id="6133877">It was never about revenge. I never had a sister.</string>
  <string id="6133878">Groans</string>
  <string id="6133883">What do you want from me?</string>
  <string id="6133889">Yes, I lied! I knew Quentin from the start.</string>
  <string id="6133926">The portrait in my house belonged to a woman I... I experimented on, when Quentin refused to teach me necromancy.</string>

  <string id="6134581">Talk about this? Like you talked with my brother before you cut him down?</string>
  <string id="6134584">That doesn't make sense. Mekel was just supposed to hand over the note!</string>
  <string id="6134587">You really think we didn't read it? We know about the gem, Charade. Hand it over. I won't let Mekel's death be for nothing.</string>
  <string id="6134588">What's a Mekel?</string>
  <string id="6134589">Who did I kill?</string>
  <string id="6134590">Insult me again, and it won't just be this Mekel who died by my hand.</string>

  <string id="6134614">My brother! Mekel was my brother, and you killed him!</string>
  <string id="6134683">I came as soon as I heard.</string>
  <string id="6134712">What a crime.</string>
  <string id="6134715">Yes, Isabela, that is something you would say.</string>
  <string id="6134721">You made short work of this lot. This is common?</string>
  <string id="6134722">Well fought, Donnic.</string>
  <string id="6134723">As common as I like. What's going on?</string>
  <string id="6134726">I didn't expect to find you so... deep in bandits.</string>
  <string id="6134727">Not such an easy assignment.</string>
  <string id="6134728">A good day, to be sure. I'll be sore tomorrow, but it was my choice.</string>
  <string id="6134731">Tell me, what's going on?</string>
  <string id="6134734">It's all right. Go ahead.</string>
  <string id="6134737">Every guard chooses the patrol they want. My wife promotes from the bold, not the reckless.</string>
  <string id="6134740">Action is up, casualties are down. It is... remarkable.</string>
  <string id="6134743">As are you, love.</string>
  <string id="6134749">Another time, Serah Hawke. Safe travels.</string>
  <string id="6134752">What's this about, Captain? Don't trust me to work on my own?</string>
  <string id="6134755">It's nothing, Guardsman. Speak your mind, as always.</string>
  <string id="6134757">Looks like she pushes you into some rough patrols.</string>
  <string id="6134758">She forces you to do this?</string>
  <string id="6134762">Sounds like you don't think much of Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6134763">You don't sound happy.</string>
  <string id="6134764">She's the captain. She's clear about what is required. What we like doesn't matter.</string>
  <string id="6134767">I expected her people to be more... protected.</string>
  <string id="6134768">She's not coddling you?</string>
  <string id="6134769">Ha! You can sit in the barracks if you like, but not if you want to get promoted any time soon.</string>
  <string id="6134772">Casualties are down, I'll admit. But you have to be tough, or you're out.</string>
  <string id="6134778">If that's all, Captain. I have to get back to my patrol.</string>
  <string id="6134783">That should be sufficient. Take that to the templar.</string>
  <string id="6134801">Indeed. Let's go talk to Cullen.</string>
  <string id="6134815">I heard what happened.</string>
  <string id="6134819">I heard the news.</string>
  <string id="6134822">I don't know what to say, but I am here.</string>
  <string id="6134825">I... uh, I feel I should say... something.</string>
  <string id="6134826">I know you're not good at... emotional stuff.</string>
  <string id="6134827">You don't have to.</string>
  <string id="6134828">I'd rather be alone right now, Isabela.</string>
  <string id="6134829">Just leave me.</string>
  <string id="6134830">Suit yourself. And I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6134840">You... know where to find me if you want to talk about it. I understand if you don't.</string>
  <string id="6134844">Donnic will be on this route.</string>
  <string id="6134847">You will not find him bored.</string>
  <string id="6134848">Let's see what his patrol consists of.</string>
  <string id="6134849">Let's see how hard you sweat your men.</string>
  <string id="6134850">I know you wouldn't send him on a boring patrol. Not you.</string>
  <string id="6134851">So, let's see what you require of your guards.</string>
  <string id="6134852">So, let's see what his patrol is.</string>
  <string id="6134865">Your Majesty. May I say what an honor it is to meet you?</string>
  <string id="6134868">You could, but you'd be the first today.</string>
  <string id="6134871">I fought at Ostagar. What happened there was... a great tragedy.</string>
  <string id="6134874">Ah. Yes. Yes, it was. Thankfully the man responsible has paid for that.</string>
  <string id="6134877">Ah. Yes, it was. Sadly, Loghain still lives.</string>
  <string id="6134886">We... we heard the Dalish were given land in Ferelden. Is it true?</string>
  <string id="6134889">Yes. I wish I could say that went better.</string>
  <string id="6134892">Why? What happened?</string>
  <string id="6134895">It's... a long story. I intend to make it up to your people, however. I owe an old friend of mine too much to do otherwise.</string>
  <string id="6134898">Chuckles Uh, well, I... Who knows?</string>
  <string id="6134901">Ferelden will always be my home.</string>
  <string id="6134902">I do.</string>
  <string id="6134903">I hope we see you back there someday. We could use someone like you, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6134904">Kirkwall is my home now.</string>
  <string id="6134905">Not anymore.</string>
  <string id="6134906">I understand. Ferelden's loss.</string>
  <string id="6134907">What do you need me to do?</string>
  <string id="6134910">Do you really think there's something I can do?</string>
  <string id="6134916">Sadly, it may be too late. Meredith got wind of my arrival sooner than I'd hoped.</string>
  <string id="6134919">Fereldans fled everywhere! And we've tried to help everyone who came back!</string>
  <string id="6134922">It's all right, Teagan. I wish we could have done more.</string>
  <string id="6134925">You know, with your help there could be a viscount.</string>
  <string id="6134928">Hypothetically speaking, you could fix the no-viscount situation.</string>
  <string id="6134931">That's asking a lot.</string>
  <string id="6134934">It's tempting. But I'm sorry to say that my support won't mean much without the support of the templars.</string>
  <string id="6134937">I suppose it doesn't matter. I was hoping to have your help before Meredith got wind of my arrival, but that's done now.</string>
  <string id="6134940">What you can do is protect Kirkwall. It will take someone like you to keep it from falling apart.</string>
  <string id="6134941">I'm the Champion. If there's a danger, I'll deal with it.</string>
  <string id="6134942">This is my city.</string>
  <string id="6134943">You remind me a little of someone I once knew.</string>
  <string id="6134946">Well, that's comforting.</string>
  <string id="6134949">Protect Kirkwall from what, exactly?</string>
  <string id="6134950">Is there another threat?</string>
  <string id="6134951">You ask me, the biggest threat to this city just walked out the door.</string>
  <string id="6134954">But maybe that's the ex-templar in me talking.</string>
  <string id="6134957">Just me standing between the city and disaster, huh?</string>
  <string id="6134958">That's a big responsibility.</string>
  <string id="6134959">I've been there. Trust me, it isn't pretty.</string>
  <string id="6134962">Well, I suppose I should get back to the old ball and chain.</string>
  <string id="6134965">You know, the queen hates it when you call her that.</string>
  <string id="6134968">No she doesn't. Just because she killed an Archdemon... she doesn't scare me.</string>
  <string id="6134971">You keep telling yourself that, Your Majesty.</string>
  <string id="6134972">Well, I suppose we should be getting back.</string>
  <string id="6134975">The Grey Wardens are waiting for you in Denerim.</string>
  <string id="6134978">With more questions, I'll bet. Lovely.</string>
  <string id="6134979">Indeed. You-know-who should already have returned from her mission.</string>
  <string id="6134982">Is she? Well! Let's not tell the queen, then.</string>
  <string id="6134985">Wouldn't dream of it, Your Majesty.</string>
  <string id="6134986">Is she? Well! The day's looking up already.</string>
  <string id="6134987">We should. The Hero of Ferelden should be back in Denerim by now.</string>
  <string id="6134990">You're always so formal. She has a name, you know.</string>
  <string id="6134991">You're always so formal. He has a name, you know.</string>
  <string id="6134994">At least your mother loved you. Not everyone can say that.</string>
  <string id="6134997">I'm going to hold on to my memories of what she was, not the thing Quentin made of her.</string>
  <string id="6134998">I'll remember her that way.</string>
  <string id="6135003">I couldn't save her. I'm to blame.</string>
  <string id="6135004">I failed her.</string>
  <string id="6135008">I'm sorry, Champion. If Captain Aveline has concerns about these accusations, bring her to speak with me.</string>
  <string id="6135033">And just think: You stopped him. Quentin's never going to hurt anyone again.</string>
  <string id="6135036">Listen, if you want to blame anyone, blame that madman, Quentin.</string>
  <string id="6135039">You loved your mother, and she knew it. It wasn't your fault.</string>
  <string id="6135060">Ir abelas, ma vhenan.</string>
  <string id="6135061">There's nothing to say right now.</string>
  <string id="6135062">I don't want to talk about it.</string>
  <string id="6135067">I let Bethany down. I promised her I'd look after Mother.</string>
  <string id="6135070">I let Carver down. I promised him I'd look after Mother.</string>
  <string id="6135073">I'm glad you're here, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6135074">Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6135075">I don't speak elven, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6135076">What?</string>
  <string id="6135077">I am filled with sorrow. For your loss.</string>
  <string id="6135080">Leandra is in a better place now.</string>
  <string id="6135081">She's with the Maker.</string>
  <string id="6135082">You're right.</string>
  <string id="6135083">All right. I'll... just go then.</string>
  <string id="6135088">Or with Falon'din. You never know.</string>
  <string id="6135092">I am a prince of Ferelden, I'm telling you!</string>
  <string id="6135095">He keeps saying that.</string>
  <string id="6135098">That's because it's true!</string>
  <string id="6135101">I think it is true, actually.</string>
  <string id="6135104">He... does look a little like King Cailan.</string>
  <string id="6135107">Well, he was a prince in bed. That's all I remember.</string>
  <string id="6135110">Well, now he's a drunk in a bar in the ass end of Kirkwall. But aren't we all?</string>
  <string id="6135113">Just leave me alone. I've had enough of people like you. You're all the same.</string>
  <string id="6135114">Keep a lid on it, prince.</string>
  <string id="6135115">Watch it.</string>
  <string id="6135116">Right, I'll shut up. Don't speak out! Don't tell anyone that a traitor should die, oh no.</string>
  <string id="6135119">Are you okay?</string>
  <string id="6135120">Do you need help?</string>
  <string id="6135121">No, not okay! Worse than okay. Disgraced traitor, that's what I am.</string>
  <string id="6135124">How about I buy the next one?</string>
  <string id="6135125">Have another drink.</string>
  <string id="6135126">I don't need another drink. Okay, maybe I do. But just one. Or two.</string>
  <string id="6135129">Now you've done it. He'll keep on like this all day.</string>
  <string id="6135132">You sound like Morrigan.</string>
  <string id="6135138">Swooping is bad...</string>
  <string id="6135142">It should have been me. Not Loghain!</string>
  <string id="6135143">I can't believe Loghain's still alive. He should have hanged!</string>
  <string id="6135144">Stupid Grey Wardens and their stupid rituals.</string>
  <string id="6135147">Why does anyone take the Joining anyway? What are the Wardens good for?</string>
  <string id="6135150">Just a stupid club, that's what it is. Everyone hanging around, talking about their taint.</string>
  <string id="6135153">Well, I don't need it.</string>
  <string id="6135156">That's right. I said it.</string>
  <string id="6135159">I failed you, Duncan. I'm so sorry.</string>
  <string id="6135160">This is all Morrigan's fault. I know it!</string>
  <string id="6135161">Just leave me alone.</string>
  <string id="6135169">Mother should be here. Alive. With her family.</string>
  <string id="6135170">That's not a comfort.</string>
  <string id="6135171">I'm sorry. I said something wrong. I... I'll just be quiet now.</string>
  <string id="6135172">Quentin used dark magic, just like you do. It turned him into a monster.</string>
  <string id="6135173">This is what magic does.</string>
  <string id="6135174">It's not the same! The magic is just a tool. He used it for something terrible.</string>
  <string id="6135177">I'm using magic to help my people. It's not the same at all.</string>
  <string id="6135180">I'm really sorry about your mother.</string>
  <string id="6135189">Yes, I'm still here! What do you want from me?</string>
  <string id="6135195">So you are here.</string>
  <string id="6135198">Go away, Teagan.</string>
  <string id="6135201">That's enough, Alistair. I think you've wallowed in self-pity long enough, don't you?</string>
  <string id="6135204">And what am I supposed to do?</string>
  <string id="6135207">Start again. Come with me. Back to Ferelden.</string>
  <string id="6135210">Sighs</string>
  <string id="6135224">I know nothing I say will change it. I'm just... I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6135228">I appreciate it, Anders.</string>
  <string id="6135229">Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6135230">I'm here for you. Whatever you need.</string>
  <string id="6135236">I didn't try hard enough to save her.</string>
  <string id="6135237">I let her down.</string>
  <string id="6135238">She wouldn't want you to blame yourself.</string>
  <string id="6135242">Maybe the templars are right.</string>
  <string id="6135243">A mage did this to her... Maybe we are a danger to everyone around us.</string>
  <string id="6135246">You still think mages should be free?</string>
  <string id="6135249">He was a madman. That's what made him do this. Not magic.</string>
  <string id="6135252">I know you're looking for someone to be angry at. If it helps, go ahead and take it out on me.</string>
  <string id="6135261">I'd rather deal with this on my own.</string>
  <string id="6135262">You should go.</string>
  <string id="6135263">I understand.</string>
  <string id="6135269">Am I to blame for not saving her?</string>
  <string id="6135270">Is it my fault?</string>
  <string id="6135271">You are looking for forgiveness, but I'm not the one who can give it to you.</string>
  <string id="6135274">Just say something. Anything.</string>
  <string id="6135275">Can you try saying something?</string>
  <string id="6135276">They say death is only a journey. Does that help?</string>
  <string id="6135277">I suppose they say you go back to the Maker when you die.</string>
  <string id="6135278">A little bit.</string>
  <string id="6135282">I'd rather be alone.</string>
  <string id="6135283">I don't need you.</string>
  <string id="6135284">Very well.</string>
  <string id="6135295">It just raises questions. Journey to where?</string>
  <string id="6135296">Not really.</string>
  <string id="6135297">I don't know. It's just something people say.</string>
  <string id="6135300">How is that supposed to help the grieving?</string>
  <string id="6135301">No.</string>
  <string id="6135302">It doesn't. But you asked me to say something.</string>
  <string id="6135305">To be honest, I don't think there is much point in filling these moments with empty talk.</string>
  <string id="6135308">I think no matter what, she'd be proud of you.</string>
  <string id="6135333">The claims against Aveline are garbage. Did you bother to verify them?</string>
  <string id="6135334">The accusations are lies.</string>
  <string id="6135335">No.</string>
  <string id="6135342">I saw no evidence to support the claims against her.</string>
  <string id="6135343">The concerns are baseless.</string>
  <string id="6135344">I have successfully wasted my time, and there is no merit to the claims.</string>
  <string id="6135345">Investigating was pointless.</string>
  <string id="6135346">Champion. And you are with the captain. None too happy about the accusations against her, I'm sure.</string>
  <string id="6135349">You could say that.</string>
  <string id="6135353">Swindler</string>
  <string id="6135357">I don't like what I'm hearing about you getting caught up in all this business between the mages and the templars.</string>
  <string id="6135360">You know how hard I've tried to keep you out of the Circle's sight.</string>
  <string id="6135361">Think of your sister. You don't want to bring the eye of the Circle down on her.</string>
  <string id="6135362">That creature Sten was horrifying enough, but a whole camp of them?</string>
  <string id="6135365">The viscount would do well to throw the lot of them back where they came from.</string>
  <string id="6135366">I've had word from Lothering. They are rebuilding. I don't know if I could ever return to the site of such horrors.</string>
  <string id="6135367">Is this dwarven venture truly the only way? I hate to think of you going willingly into the darkspawn's grasp.</string>
  <string id="6135368">Mother was all I had left.</string>
  <string id="6135369">I've no family now.</string>
  <string id="6135370">You don't really think that, do you? </string>
  <string id="6135373">So this is what it's like to be an orphan.</string>
  <string id="6135374">I'm an orphan.</string>
  <string id="6135375">Family's not just the people you're related to by blood. There are other people who care about you.</string>
  <string id="6135378">Like... Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6135595">Oh, look who's here! Time to change the locks again.</string>
  <string id="6135598">I knocked this time. Bodahn let me in.</string>
  <string id="6135601">That's private.</string>
  <string id="6135607">You only make the trip here when you want something. What is it this time?</string>
  <string id="6135610">Is everything all right?</string>
  <string id="6135616">Guess what? Castillon's in town, and I'm not waiting around for him to stick a knife in my vitals. </string>
  <string id="6135619">We're going to get him before he gets me.</string>
  <string id="6135620">Could Castillon be in Kirkwall for other reasons?</string>
  <string id="6135621">Not everything is about you.</string>
  <string id="6135622">Maybe, but that doesn't change anything. Better safe than sorry.</string>
  <string id="6135625">We're going to surprise Castillon? I love surprises.</string>
  <string id="6135626">Count me in.</string>
  <string id="6135627">That rule has served me well.</string>
  <string id="6135628">I agree.</string>
  <string id="6135629">Unfortunately, Castillon's holed up somewhere in Kirkwall. I haven't been able to find him.</string>
  <string id="6135632">I do know where Velasco is, however. That's his right hand. We just have to make him tell us where Castillon is.</string>
  <string id="6135635">Somehow.</string>
  <string id="6135636">So you're saying you don't have a plan.</string>
  <string id="6135637">Somehow?</string>
  <string id="6135638">I have something of a plan.</string>
  <string id="6135641">What a plan! Your scheming ability puts me to shame.</string>
  <string id="6135642">Brilliant!</string>
  <string id="6135643">Well, I haven't worked out all the kinks.</string>
  <string id="6135646">Step one, we go to Velasco. Step two, something exciting happens. Step three, profit!</string>
  <string id="6135652">Well, do you have a better idea?</string>
  <string id="6135653">If we kill him and search his body, we might find something.</string>
  <string id="6135654">We kill him?</string>
  <string id="6135655">Or we could find nothing, and get nowhere.</string>
  <string id="6135656">Couldn't we just ask Velasco where Castillon is? Nicely?</string>
  <string id="6135657">Can't we just talk to Velasco?</string>
  <string id="6135658">He's not going to reveal anything willingly. I can't risk him getting suspicious and alerting Castillon.</string>
  <string id="6135659">We could hit him till he talks? </string>
  <string id="6135660">Violence?</string>
  <string id="6135661">You'll just end up killing him. </string>
  <string id="6135662">Castillon wants you. Why not let Velasco bring you to him?</string>
  <string id="6135663">We can use you as bait.</string>
  <string id="6135664">And... you follow me. Ooh, that's clever.</string>
  <string id="6135667">I was going to suggest challenging Velasco to a riddle game, and making Where's your boss? one of the riddles.</string>
  <string id="6135670">This is so much better.</string>
  <string id="6135671">I'm ready whenever you are.</string>
  <string id="6135672">Let's go then.</string>
  <string id="6135673">Velasco's been spending his nights at the brothel, enjoying its many splendors. That's where we'll find him.</string>
  <string id="6135679">On second thought, this is too dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6135680">No, I've changed my mind.</string>
  <string id="6135681">What? You can't suggest a bold, exciting plan and then just... back out! Ugh!</string>
  <string id="6135684">All right, look. Velasco spends his nights at the brothel.</string>
  <string id="6135687">When you change your mind, we'll go look for him.</string>
  <string id="6135690">I can't think of anything. You'll have to manage on your own.</string>
  <string id="6135691">I've no ideas.</string>
  <string id="6135692">What if you took me to Velasco and pretended to betray me?</string>
  <string id="6135695">You say you're giving me to Castillon for gold, and Velasco takes me to him...</string>
  <string id="6135698">And I'll follow you to their hideout.</string>
  <string id="6135701">Exactly. Once Castillon shows himself, we'll take care of him.</string>
  <string id="6135702">I'm not going to play your game.</string>
  <string id="6135703">I won't lie for you.</string>
  <string id="6135704">Ugh. Typical.</string>
  <string id="6135707">You might get hurt. I can't be part of something so reckless.</string>
  <string id="6135708">This is too dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6135709">Sighs Really? You're just going to let me down like this?</string>
  <string id="6135712">I have ways of making people talk.</string>
  <string id="6135713">Violence is effective.</string>
  <string id="6135714">That's not going to work. You'll just end up killing him.</string>
  <string id="6135717">We'll have to think of something else.</string>
  <string id="6135724">Urn of Sacred Ashes</string>
  <string id="6135725">Urn of Sacred Ashes</string>
  <string id="6135726">What did you do in the Urn of Sacred Ashes plot?</string>
  <string id="6135727">The world knows about the Urn.</string>
  <string id="6135728">Genitivi spread word.</string>
  <string id="6135729">Nothing relevant.</string>
  <string id="6135730">Nothing relevant.</string>
  <string id="6135731">What about your mother? Is she still alive?</string>
  <string id="6135732">Where's your mother?</string>
  <string id="6135733">I don't know. I have no memory of her. At least you knew your mother.</string>
  <string id="6135739">Come here, you great mangy beast. You need a bath!</string>
  <string id="6135742">Whines</string>
  <string id="6135745">Don't you talk to me like that. You're a Kirkwall dog now, not Ferelden. You have appearances to keep up.</string>
  <string id="6135748">Whines</string>
  <string id="6135749">It's not fair the way you exploit that poor child to do your enchantment.</string>
  <string id="6135750">I do hope you've been up front with me about really owning it. I don't want to be at the mercy of that wretched Dougal.</string>
  <string id="6135753">It's nice to be here, though. To feel like an Amell again.</string>
  <string id="6135756">Just one minute. You got your brother killed! Aren't you the least bit upset about that?</string>
  <string id="6135762">I think you should get out of here while you still can, Iwan.</string>
  <string id="6135765">I don't know if it's a good idea to take on the templars on their own ground.</string>
  <string id="6135766">Isn't this dangerous?</string>
  <string id="6135767">It's a risk I have taken frequently, to save the life of a single mage.</string>
  <string id="6135770">Would you do less to stop a plot that would destroy all of them?</string>
  <string id="6135771">Get away from me, demon!</string>
  <string id="6135774">I-I need to get out of here.</string>
  <string id="6135777">I am no demon! Are you one of them, that you would call me such?</string>
  <string id="6135782">Merin got himself killed, didn't you hear?</string>
  <string id="6135785">You little shit...</string>
  <string id="6135788">You should punch him. In the face.</string>
  <string id="6135789">Leave him be. He's not worth it.</string>
  <string id="6135790">I doubt many people would miss this one. I'd kill him.</string>
  <string id="6135791">Varric, he'll get his. I promise.</string>
  <string id="6135792">Hopefully you can address the accusations against the guard captain. I don't have time for gentle solutions.</string>
  <string id="6135797">Does no one see this exclamation mark over my head?</string>
  <string id="6135798">Don't bother me.</string>
  <string id="6135799">Secret Rendezvous</string>
  <string id="6135803">You-you saved my life, messere. What was that thing?</string>
  <string id="6135804">He's no demon. Just a deeply troubled man.</string>
  <string id="6135805">He's my friend.</string>
  <string id="6135806">Don't worry, it was all a trick by the Circle to scare you away from ever summoning demons.</string>
  <string id="6135807">An elaborate stunt.</string>
  <string id="6135808">I-I wouldn't... I never—</string>
  <string id="6135811">It was a joke.</string>
  <string id="6135814">He's a demon, whether he admits it or not.</string>
  <string id="6135815">Just what it looked like.</string>
  <string id="6135816">Can I... go home now?</string>
  <string id="6135817">Find your parents, but don't stay there. You must leave Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6135818">Go somewhere safe.</string>
  <string id="6135819">I know. There's nowhere in the city where Ser Alrik's men won't find me.</string>
  <string id="6135822">Thank you, messere. Andraste herself must have put you in that room.</string>
  <string id="6135823">Ser Alrik is gone. You'll be safest in the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6135824">Go back to the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6135825">Without Ser Alrik...</string>
  <string id="6135828">Maybe Bethany's right. The Circle isn't so bad.</string>
  <string id="6135831">Thank you again, messere.</string>
  <string id="6135835">Go to the Docks at night to intercept and break up the raider captains' meeting. Eavesdrop on their conversation for an additional reward.</string>
  <string id="6135844">Ser Alrik's Letter</string>
  <string id="6135846">To Her Excellency, Divine Justinia,&#13;
&#13;
I am well aware both you and Knight-Commander Meredith have rejected my proposal, but I beg you to reconsider. The mages in the Free Marches are past controlling, their numbers have doubled in three years, and they have found a way to plant their abominations in our ranks. They cannot be contained!&#13;
&#13;
The Tranquil Solution is our answer. All mages at the age of majority must be made Tranquil. They'll coexist peacefully, retain their usefulness—a perfect strategy! It's simply the best way to ensure mages obey the laws of men and Maker.&#13;
&#13;
I remain, as always, your obedient servant,&#13;
Ser Otto Alrik</string>
  <string id="6135849">I...</string>
  <string id="6135852">Well?</string>
  <string id="6135856">Return to the suspicious lady in the Hanged Man tonight; let her know the raider captains are dead and their plans were overheard.</string>
  <string id="6135857">Return to the suspicious lady in the Hanged Man tonight and let her know the raider captains are dead.</string>
  <string id="6135858">The raider captains are dead and the suspicious lady is pleased.</string>
  <string id="6135860">I'd have killed him back in the Deep Roads, myself.</string>
  <string id="6135869">As I suspected.</string>
  <string id="6135872">Then why press this?</string>
  <string id="6135878">Some feel that the solution to the current crisis of leadership is to... consolidate authority.</string>
  <string id="6135881">As long as these complaints continue, baseless or not, they will serve as justification for eliminating the position of guard captain.</string>
  <string id="6135884">It would be the simplest fix, whether or not I agree.</string>
  <string id="6135885">They want to lie about her, let them do it to her face.</string>
  <string id="6135886">Let Aveline face her accusers.</string>
  <string id="6135887">Perhaps I can reason with the people who are complaining about her.</string>
  <string id="6135888">Who is behind the complaints?</string>
  <string id="6135889">Just point me in the right direction, and I'll get you some peace and quiet.</string>
  <string id="6135890">I will convince them to stop.</string>
  <string id="6135891">This isn't right. I alphabetized the potions yesterday.</string>
  <string id="6135892">The best armor coin can buy!</string>
  <string id="6135895">Belts, rings, amulets! We sell them all!</string>
  <string id="6135896">Sounds familiar.</string>
  <string id="6135897">Thank you. That will do.</string>
  <string id="6135900">Suspicious Lady</string>
  <string id="6135903">On the list of things I thought might happen today, a Qunari attack would have been near the bottom.</string>
  <string id="6135906">Just near the bottom?</string>
  <string id="6135909">Just near the bottom?</string>
  <string id="6135912">It's a big list. I like to be prepared.</string>
  <string id="6135915">Thank you for your help. I don't think we've met. My name is Alistair.</string>
  <string id="6135918">Oh, I remember you!</string>
  <string id="6135921">Isabela. Yes, I... remember you, too.</string>
  <string id="6135924">Are you staying? We could catch up.</string>
  <string id="6135927">Isabela? I guess your ship made it out of Ferelden, then.</string>
  <string id="6135930">Yes, but not much further.</string>
  <string id="6135933">I'd like nothing better than to stay and help, but... unfortunately, the mission we're on can't be delayed.</string>
  <string id="6135934">You wouldn't think so, right? I'm afraid there are larger things afoot.</string>
  <string id="6135937">I can't say more than that. I wish I could, but I swore on my pinky to keep the Warden's secrets.</string>
  <string id="6135938">I thought your order was more... serious.</string>
  <string id="6135939">You don't seem like a Warden.</string>
  <string id="6135940">Really? I thought the Joining was a laugh a minute.</string>
  <string id="6135943">I get that a lot.</string>
  <string id="6135944">Even if I didn't need to go, Grey Wardens aren't supposed to involve themselves in wars like this.</string>
  <string id="6135947">We did that in Ferelden, after all. The order was not impressed, let me tell you.</string>
  <string id="6135950">Maybe... this isn't the time for that?</string>
  <string id="6135956">Here, maybe this might help? It belonged to the love of my life... and she doesn't need it anymore.</string>
  <string id="6135957">Maybe this might help? It belongs to the love of my life... but she seems to find stuff like this everywhere she goes.</string>
  <string id="6135958">Here, maybe this might help? It belonged to an old friend of mine... who doesn't need it anymore.</string>
  <string id="6135959">Here, maybe this might help? It belongs to an old friend, but I'm willing to bet he'd like you to have it.</string>
  <string id="6135960">Here, maybe this might help? It belongs to an old friend, but I'm willing to bet she'd like you to have it.</string>
  <string id="6135963">Maker watch over you, my friend. And over us all.</string>
  <string id="6135966">I have no objection, but the anonymous are rarely so brave. I can say that all of the complaints have originated in Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6135967">If they meant to use reason, they would not be anonymous. But the complaints originate in Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6135970">I have no answers for you other than to say that all of the complaints have come from Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6135973">Guardsman Brennan is on that patrol. Why wouldn't she tell me of this?</string>
  <string id="6135976">I don't know, but... I do apologize for the assumptions of this incident, Guard-Captain. It has been... unfortunate.</string>
  <string id="6135982">To Lowtown, Hawke. I need to speak to Brennan.</string>
  <string id="6135985">Stop that! You're acting like a moody child.</string>
  <string id="6135986">Anders, calm down.</string>
  <string id="6135989">You've been right all along.</string>
  <string id="6135992">I was wrong. I thought I could contain Justice, but...</string>
  <string id="6135996">What happened in there?</string>
  <string id="6135997">You killed that girl!</string>
  <string id="6136000">You almost killed that girl!</string>
  <string id="6136003">This is all Ser Alrik had. Looks like the Tranquil Solution began and ended with him.</string>
  <string id="6136004">I found Ser Alrik's papers.</string>
  <string id="6136005">Let me see that! The Divine... rejected the idea. Meredith rejected the idea! This was... not what I expected.</string>
  <string id="6136008">I see monsters everywhere, but I'm the real monster.</string>
  <string id="6136011">Justice has been warped by my rage. I cannot contain him any longer.</string>
  <string id="6136014">You're right. I cannot change who... what I am.</string>
  <string id="6136017">I should get out of Kirkwall, go where I won't hurt anyone. Would you have me leave?</string>
  <string id="6136018">Did you... find anything on Ser Alrik? Or was the Tranquil Solution just another of my delusions?</string>
  <string id="6136021">It exists, but it was Ser Alrik's plan, no one else's.</string>
  <string id="6136024">Perhaps I should try talking to the grand cleric. Maybe she's more reasonable than I thought.</string>
  <string id="6136032">Knight-Lieutenant Barsus</string>

  <string id="6136095">I was too late.</string>
  <string id="6136101">They had the same... face.</string>
  <string id="6136104">I'm sorry it ended that way.</string>
  <string id="6136105">That's sad.</string>
  <string id="6136106">He was better off. I saved him a lot of trouble in the long run.</string>
  <string id="6136107">Love them and leave them, eh?</string>
  <string id="6136108">You heartbreaker.</string>
  <string id="6136112">You dared to rise up against me, Champion. Now you will feel the sting of the Maker's wrath!</string>
  <string id="6136113">You will fall here, Champion! All of Kirkwall will see what an insignificant gnat you truly are!</string>
  <string id="6136117">How does it feel, Champion, to know I hold the life of one you love in my hands?</string>
  <string id="6136121">You killed Elthina, you pathetic little fool. And for what? Nothing! You prove only your own evil!</string>
  <string id="6136125">You were wrong to turn against this city, Captain. And now you shall pay the price!</string>
  <string id="6136129">You allowed evil into your heart, Ser Carver! Now I shall extinguish it forever!</string>
  <string id="6136133">Watch, Champion, as I crush the life out of your sister! Watch her squirm before the Maker!</string>
  <string id="6136137">All you mages are alike. Always falling to darkness, always traitors in the end. Well no more!</string>
  <string id="6136141">Why would you defend these mages? They are an infection upon all humanity!</string>
  <string id="6136151">It's not enough that they make innocents suffer, no! We must also have insult added to injury!</string>
  <string id="6136154">Spare the mages? Give them freedom? And they would use it to tear down everything we hold dear!</string>
  <string id="6136157">No! No, it cannot be allowed! I will stop it!</string>
  <string id="6136160">Do you hear me, Champion? I will defeat you!</string>
  <string id="6136166">Why is this taking so long? Can ones so evil truly be so powerful?</string>
  <string id="6136169">Maker, guide your humble servant! Please tell me what I must do!</string>
  <string id="6136172">What if... I'm not doing the right thing? What if this is all madness?</string>
  <string id="6136175">No! I must remain vigilant!</string>
  <string id="6136179">I tried to have sympathy. Maker knows I have tried!</string>
  <string id="6136182">But how can we allow them freedom when so many would use it to commit atrocities?</string>
  <string id="6136185">They control minds! They become abominations! They began the Blight itself!</string>
  <string id="6136188">And now Elthina. Oh, poor Elthina. I will avenge you, dear friend!</string>
  <string id="6136189">Ship Captain</string>
  <string id="6136191">I am a monster.</string>
  <string id="6136196">Ship Captain</string>
  <string id="6136200">Corrupt Guard</string>
  <string id="6136204">Sailor</string>
  <string id="6136206">Why did you come back? For this?</string>
  <string id="6136209">Have you been lurking here for the past three years?</string>
  <string id="6136210">Where have you been, Anders?</string>
  <string id="6136211">I thought to leave, but the need here was too great.</string>
  <string id="6136214">I have stayed out of your path, Champion. You made it clear there was no place for me on it.</string>
  <string id="6136217">Bugger off!</string>
  <string id="6136218">Guardsman!</string>
  <string id="6136222">Champion? Well, this patrol will be quiet. Haven't seen the captain, if that's who you're looking for.</string>
  <string id="6136230">Couldn't you talk to him for me? Please?</string>
  <string id="6136231">Did you leave this in a puddle? Everything is soaked through!</string>
  <string id="6136237">This is Serah Hawke, messere. The one I told you about it.</string>
  <string id="6136238">Do you really think your threats will work? You killed my brother!</string>
  <string id="6136245">Alistair</string>
  <string id="6136295">I could say no, but would that help?</string>
  <string id="6136298">I've heard that, too.</string>
  <string id="6136304">That's right. He should've known better.</string>
  <string id="6136305">I bet he got over it.</string>
  <string id="6136306">I'm sure he survived.</string>
  <string id="6136307">He must have. I don't know. I never saw him again.</string>
  <string id="6136316">He doesn't bite, Pol. Just tell him you made a mistake.</string>
  <string id="6136319">I ruined a piece of ironwood! That's not a mistake to Master Ilen, that's like committing murder!</string>
  <string id="6136325">So you married a templar, huh?</string>
  <string id="6136326">Do you ever miss Ferelden?</string>
  <string id="6136327">So, I never expected to be palling around with the captain of the guard.</string>
  <string id="6136328">Can I ask you something, Aveline?</string>
  <string id="6136329">I suppose you're just thrilled how the knight-commander's basically stepped into the viscount's seat?</string>
  <string id="6136330">Your husband agrees with me.</string>
  <string id="6136334">Where did you learn your magic?</string>
  <string id="6136335">The Rite of Tranquility is the whole problem. If they didn't have that to hold over us, we'd have so many more options.</string>
  <string id="6136339">I'm sorry about your sister. She sounds like a special girl.</string>
  <string id="6136340">Nice day to be planning a trip into the Deep Roads, don't you think?</string>
  <string id="6136353">I keep thinking I know you from somewhere...</string>
  <string id="6136354">Sometimes, I think you have the right idea.</string>
  <string id="6136355">Do you never have any regrets?</string>
  <string id="6136356">What makes this relic of yours so valuable?</string>
  <string id="6136357">You're not nearly as selfish as you pretend.</string>
  <string id="6136358">I can't believe you're still not taking sides.</string>
  <string id="6136362">So, when you first did blood magic, it was... just an accident, right?</string>
  <string id="6136363">Maybe you don't really understand the difference between spirits and demons.</string>
  <string id="6136364">Do Dalish honestly not recognize the difference between demons and beneficial spirits?</string>
  <string id="6136365">It's not a good feeling, you know.</string>
  <string id="6136366">Your Keeper did not deserve that death.</string>
  <string id="6136367">You must join us. Do you see that now? You must stand with Kirkwall's mages.</string>
  <string id="6136371">What?</string>
  <string id="6136372">Why'd your people build so many bloody roads, anyway, Varric?</string>
  <string id="6136373">Boiling in oil.</string>
  <string id="6136374">Oh, cheer up, Blondie. You're making me cry just looking at you.</string>
  <string id="6136375">You're giving me that look again. What are you writing this time?</string>
  <string id="6136376">So, the knight-commander... Boiling in oil? That one never gets old.</string>
  <string id="6136444">So, you were in the Circle and ran away. I don't know if I'd be brave enough to do that.</string>
  <string id="6136445">I know it didn't work the way you wanted, but... it was brave, what you did with Justice.</string>
  <string id="6136449">Was Wesley based out of the Lothering chantry? I don't remember ever seeing him there.</string>
  <string id="6136450">Being a guardsman seems like a better life than being a soldier.</string>
  <string id="6136451">How come you and Wesley never had children? I mean, sorry if that's too personal—</string>
  <string id="6136461">Do you ever miss Tevinter?</string>
  <string id="6136462">So, the magister put lyrium in your skin?</string>
  <string id="6136466">What were you before you were a pirate?</string>
  <string id="6136467">I guess you've been with a lot of men.</string>
  <string id="6136471">So, there's no Circle among the Dalish?</string>
  <string id="6136472">So, is the Keeper... your mother?</string>
  <string id="6136476">You don't seem to like your brother very much.</string>
  <string id="6136477">Do you ever wish you lived in Orzammar?</string>
  <string id="6136638">I heard Varric saying you were a Grey Warden.</string>
  <string id="6136639">Ser Pounce-a-lot... who knighted him?</string>
  <string id="6136640">You could get another cat, you know. There's one in the Lowtown market with a litter of kittens ready to wean.</string>
  <string id="6136641">Are you all right?</string>
  <string id="6136642">Have I ever mentioned that I like your coat?</string>
  <string id="6136643">You really believe, don't you?</string>
  <string id="6136647">You must really like the Hawke family.</string>
  <string id="6136648">Did Lothering have an alienage?</string>
  <string id="6136649">The Qunari must like it here, to stay so long.</string>
  <string id="6136650">This mirror of yours—what does it do?</string>
  <string id="6136651">Aveline... do you think we'll win?</string>
  <string id="6136656">You're so lucky.</string>
  <string id="6136657">If you could do anything—just anything at all—what would you do?</string>
  <string id="6136661">Do you miss it? Ferelden, I mean.</string>
  <string id="6136662">How did you learn swording?</string>
  <string id="6136666">You've probably never met a Dalish before, have you?</string>
  <string id="6136667">Certainly your people have stories about the Dalish. No?</string>
  <string id="6136668">Did you step on something sharp, Fenris?</string>
  <string id="6136669">Giggles</string>
  <string id="6136670">Do you regret it? What happened with your sister, I mean.</string>
  <string id="6136671">Poor Anders.</string>
  <string id="6136675">How do you do that?</string>
  <string id="6136676">Do you have a parrot, Isabela?</string>
  <string id="6136677">What was Llomerryn like? I've never heard of a Dalish who's been there.</string>
  <string id="6136678">How do you suppose the Qunari scratch their heads with those horns in the way?</string>
  <string id="6136679">I think that Hawke likes you, Isabela.</string>
  <string id="6136680">Do you think you'll leave Kirkwall some day?</string>
  <string id="6136684">I've never met a dwarf before.</string>
  <string id="6136685">You remind me of Hahren Paivel, Varric. Only younger. And shorter. And not as serious.</string>
  <string id="6136686">Bianca is a very pretty name.</string>
  <string id="6136687">I'm sorry about your brother, Varric. Have you any other family?</string>
  <string id="6136688">Is there a story behind Bianca?</string>
  <string id="6136689">Varric, how does the story end?</string>
  <string id="6136692">I've always wondered, why is every surface dwarf a merchant or a smith?</string>
  <string id="6136693">So a human, an elf, and a dwarf walk into a bar...</string>
  <string id="6136694">Blondie, I don't mean to sound critical, but have you considered a new line of work?</string>
  <string id="6136695">If you've got something to say, just spit it out.</string>
  <string id="6136696">So, three templars walk into a tavern.</string>
  <string id="6136697">You've been glowering for days. Your face is going to get stuck that way.</string>
  <string id="6136700">A Fereldan in the guard. What will they think of next?</string>
  <string id="6136701">So what do you do, Aveline?</string>
  <string id="6136702">Blondie, Sunshine, Daisy, Rivaini... what am I?</string>
  <string id="6136703">You know the Tethras family businesses are registered in your cousin Elmand's name?</string>
  <string id="6136704">Why are you still here, Varric?</string>
  <string id="6136705">Strange, I always thought I'd wind up arresting you some day.</string>
  <string id="6136709">Are you really not afraid of apostates? Not even a little?</string>
  <string id="6136710">So... Milady Sunshine, what's your first act as a noblewoman going to be?</string>
  <string id="6136714">You know, Junior, it's eerie how much resemblance there is between you two.</string>
  <string id="6136715">You know, Junior, you're looking at this all wrong.</string>
  <string id="6136719">So, elf. That thing you do with your hand...</string>
  <string id="6136720">Is brooding a sport in Tevinter? Do they hold competitions? Hand out trophies for the best scowls?</string>
  <string id="6136721">You really ought to take that offer, elf. It'd keep the Coterie off your back pretty much permanently.</string>
  <string id="6136722">So what do you do in that gigantic house all day?</string>
  <string id="6136723">You know you still owe me five sovereigns, elf.</string>
  <string id="6136724">So... you and Hawke?</string>
  <string id="6136729">You know, Rivaini, you promised me you'd tell me how your ship wrecked.</string>
  <string id="6136730">Were you listening to that guy in the Hanged Man last night?</string>
  <string id="6136731">So... Hawke and Daisy?</string>
  <string id="6136732">You have got to tell me what was in that box, Rivaini.</string>
  <string id="6136733">Just curious, does any of this make sense to you?</string>
  <string id="6136737">Thank you very much for the help earlier, Varric! </string>
  <string id="6136738">Daisy, for my sake, please quit cutting through the alleys in Lowtown alone at night.</string>
  <string id="6136739">So, I hear you've been visiting the viscount's gardens, Daisy.</string>
  <string id="6136740">Why a mirror?</string>
  <string id="6136741">You should have this back.</string>
  <string id="6136742">How do you do it, living in this city without picking a side? Doesn't it matter to you?</string>
  <string id="6136751">Why did a templar have to tell me there is unrest in this district? What's going on?</string>
  <string id="6136767">It's Captain Jeven. I didn't report his return because... I'm ashamed for him.</string>
  <string id="6136773">He's trying to rile the guards against you, but none of us will follow him.</string>
  <string id="6136776">You lead better than he ever did.</string>
  <string id="6136777">Good start. Where's he hiding?</string>
  <string id="6136778">Keep talking.</string>
  <string id="6136782">The guards will have nothing to do with him, so he found others. Militia, mostly anti-Fereldan.</string>
  <string id="6136813">You seem to know a great deal about the Champion's private life.</string>
  <string id="6136814">There are rather large gaps in your story.</string>
  <string id="6136815">Just how many apostates were there in Kirkwall?</string>
  <string id="6136816">Why do you pause every time your story takes us through a door?</string>
  <string id="6136836">You know, now that I think about it, we really killed a lot of people.</string>
  <string id="6136868">At least it's not a hanging offence. You can do this. Be brave!</string>
  <string id="6136869">The Getaway</string>
  <string id="6136872">We need to find him. Guardsman?</string>
  <string id="6136873">Where is he now?</string>
  <string id="6136874">Well, let's go have a chat with the man.</string>
  <string id="6136875">Time to find him.</string>
  <string id="6136876">We've made so many enemies. I don't remember him as that impressive.</string>
  <string id="6136877">The captain you replaced?</string>
  <string id="6136878">He deserves to be forgotten. He abused his position, and blamed me when we caught him.</string>
  <string id="6136881">He was well liked by some, but not once the truth was known.</string>
  <string id="6136882">Many did not believe it. He was very good to his friends.</string>
  <string id="6136885">It's what some choose to remember when you are... strict.</string>
  <string id="6136888">That is not the job.</string>
  <string id="6136889">Escort Teagan and Connor to their ship.</string>
  <string id="6136897">It's fine, my love.</string>
  <string id="6136898">King Alistair</string>
  <string id="6136899">Dear Champion,&#13;
&#13;
Please meet me in the Keep.&#13;
&#13;
-King Alistair of Ferelden</string>
  <string id="6136900">King Alistair of Ferelden is waiting in the Keep. Best not to keep a king waiting.</string>
  <string id="6136905">Hums</string>
  <string id="6136909">I've been wondering if I shouldn't remarry.</string>
  <string id="6136912">I've seen how you and that elf look at each other.</string>
  <string id="6136915">I've heard that pirate girl of yours talk.</string>
  <string id="6136918">I've seen how that Anders fellow looks at you.</string>
  <string id="6136921">I'm sure the last thing you need is your mother watching over your shoulder every time you come home.</string>
  <string id="6136924">But perhaps there is still life once your children have outgrown you.</string>
  <string id="6136925">You've been through a lot. You deserve any joy you can find.</string>
  <string id="6136926">I want you to be happy.</string>
  <string id="6136927">Thank you, love.</string>
  <string id="6136930">No one could ever replace your father.</string>
  <string id="6136933">Sounds like you've got someone in mind.</string>
  <string id="6136934">You want to remarry?</string>
  <string id="6136935">Nothing I'm ready to share yet, so don't pry.</string>
  <string id="6136938">But it is refreshing to think I could still be courted at this age.</string>
  <string id="6136939">No one is going to take Father's place.</string>
  <string id="6136940">Forget it.</string>
  <string id="6136941">Malcolm was the love of my life, the father of my children. No one can ever fill his spot in my heart.</string>
  <string id="6136944">That doesn't mean I don't deserve some company in my dotage.</string>
  <string id="6136949">Enchantment!</string>
  <string id="6136952">He likes the work, and he's good at it. What's the problem?</string>
  <string id="6136955">It just doesn't seem right.</string>
  <string id="6136956">Are you really getting involved with those Qunari? Be careful. They don't think like us.</string>
  <string id="6136957">I'm so glad Aveline found a role in the city guard. She seemed such a nice young lady.</string>
  <string id="6136958">Those elves you're friends with, they're... rather strange, aren't they?</string>
  <string id="6136959">You found Alistair!</string>
  <string id="6136960">Alistair is gone...</string>
  <string id="6136963">If your bow splits when you draw it, then it's hardly fine! You can't be so careless, love!</string>
  <string id="6136966">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6136967">King Alistair</string>
  <string id="6136971">Teagan</string>
  <string id="6136975">Templar</string>
  <string id="6136979">Human, I heard... that you found my husband.</string>
  <string id="6136981">Set an Origins State</string>
  <string id="6136982">Set an Origins State</string>
  <string id="6136983">For which plot?</string>
  <string id="6136984">Go back</string>
  <string id="6136985">Go back</string>
  <string id="6136986">Secret Rendezvous</string>
  <string id="6136987">Secret Rendezvous</string>
  <string id="6136988">Where in the plot</string>
  <string id="6136989">Start of the plot</string>
  <string id="6136990">Start of the plot</string>
  <string id="6136991">Go to meeting</string>
  <string id="6136992">Go to meeting</string>
  <string id="6136993">Return</string>
  <string id="6136994">Return</string>
  <string id="6136995">Exit</string>
  <string id="6136996">Exit</string>
  <string id="6137001">The same kind who were against the Qunari. I guess they needed a new target.</string>
  <string id="6137004">The same kind who were against the qunari. I guess it's been long enough they've forgotten how many the Champion killed.</string>
  <string id="6137007">A rally. Against the tyranny of the guard, and foreigners who infest Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6137010">I'm sorry, Captain.</string>
  <string id="6137014">A messenger said you wanted to see me.</string>
  <string id="6137026">Father... I—</string>
  <string id="6137032">You're pretty useful in a fight. You don't take after Gamlen at all.</string>
  <string id="6137033">And I wouldn't have taken you for his daughter, what with being able to fight.</string>
  <string id="6137034">You don't either.</string>
  <string id="6137035">I don't care if you're my cousin or not. You could have gotten one of us killed!</string>
  <string id="6137036">You idiot.</string>
  <string id="6137037">I'm sorry you got tangled up in all this. I didn't set this up for you.</string>
  <string id="6137038">Gamlen never told me he had a daughter.</string>
  <string id="6137039">So Gamlen's your father?</string>
  <string id="6137040">There's probably a lot of things he hasn't told you. </string>
  <string id="6137043">My mother, Mara... she left Gamlen before I was born. He was so fixated on finding that stupid gem, I doubt he even noticed she was gone.</string>
  <string id="6137052">Next time you want to talk to someone, maybe try knocking on their door first.</string>
  <string id="6137053">Why the runaround?</string>
  <string id="6137054">Oh, yes. That sounds brilliant. Just show up on his doorstep and say, hi, I'm your daughter. I doubt that would go over well.</string>
  <string id="6137066">I think you should go talk to Gamlen. Does he even know about you?</string>
  <string id="6137067">You should meet your father.</string>
  <string id="6137068">I... I'm not sure.</string>
  <string id="6137071">Maybe give him a chance before you write him off.</string>
  <string id="6137074">I think I will. Having a cousin turned out to be a good thing. Maybe having a father will, too.</string>
  <string id="6137075">If you have issues with Gamlen, deal with them yourself. I'm done here.</string>
  <string id="6137076">I don't care.</string>
  <string id="6137077">Why am I not surprised? A man is only as good as the company he keeps.</string>
  <string id="6137080">Take the blasted thing. My dear father deserves no less. And no more.</string>
  <string id="6137186">I'm so sorry, Ineria.</string>
  <string id="6137187">It's ill news, but I thank you for it all the same.</string>
  <string id="6137190">I don't like the idea of this boy dying alone down here.</string>
  <string id="6137193">How is his brother getting killed our fault?</string>
  <string id="6137196">We should go after both if we can.</string>
  <string id="6137199">No one deserves to die down here.</string>
  <string id="6137202">Oh... poor Merin.</string>
  <string id="6137205">Whatever we're doing, we should do it fast. The darkspawn will return soon.</string>
  <string id="6137216">He's added his loyalists to some local militia. Anti-Fereldans.</string>
  <string id="6137222">Return to the barracks.</string>
  <string id="6137227">The rally is in Darktown, Hawke. I need to be there.</string>
  <string id="6137228">It's Captain Jeven. I didn't report his return because... I'm ashamed for some of the guards.</string>
  <string id="6137231">Some are standing with him. They say he shared the wealth.</string>
  <string id="6137234">Even corrupt, they prefer him to your... stringent order.</string>
  <string id="6137239">You brought this upon us, traitor! Your sick magic drew that monster here!</string>
  <string id="6137242">Your captain asked a question.</string>
  <string id="6137245">Guardsman?</string>
  <string id="6137248">Better make it good.</string>
  <string id="6137264">Too long, brave Kirkwall! You did not throw off all others only to fall under Fereldan influence!</string>
  <string id="6137270">Leaderless, displaced! Alien hands on the most basic authority. Foreign elite bleeding you!</string>
  <string id="6137273">Jeven!</string>
  <string id="6137279">You... disgrace yourself.</string>
  <string id="6137282">The Fereldan with the Orlesian name!</string>
  <string id="6137283">This one is all yours, Captain.</string>
  <string id="6137284">Have at him, Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6137285">Do they know how you sacrificed your men? How you alone disgraced your name?</string>
  <string id="6137288">Bitch! You took everything from me!</string>
  <string id="6137297">I will not be left with nothing again.</string>
  <string id="6137308">I don't have time for another fanatic!</string>
  <string id="6137309">No arguing, just get him!</string>
  <string id="6137310">I'll try my best.</string>
  <string id="6137460">Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6137463">I don't care what else is going on. We haven't spoken about Leandra. How are you?</string>
  <string id="6137464">Keep your sympathy for the next person you let die.</string>
  <string id="6137465">This was your fault, Captain!</string>
  <string id="6137466">What was that for?</string>
  <string id="6137469">Your job is protecting the city. If you were any good, my mother would be alive.</string>
  <string id="6137472">I see.</string>
  <string id="6137475">Well?</string>
  <string id="6137478">Well what?</string>
  <string id="6137479">Hit back. Give me a worthy target!</string>
  <string id="6137480">Defend yourself!</string>
  <string id="6137481">It would help, wouldn't it? To have a target that could undo this?</string>
  <string id="6137484">Get mad or swear it'll never happen again or... something!</string>
  <string id="6137485">I don't know!</string>
  <string id="6137486">It would help if someone knew what to do, wouldn't it?</string>
  <string id="6137489">So you agree that you should have stopped this?</string>
  <string id="6137490">You admit it?</string>
  <string id="6137491">Would have? Certainly. Could have? Some people are broken.</string>
  <string id="6137494">I don't have an answer that can satisfy you. The guards never do. Cast your blame if you want, but this isn't about me.</string>
  <string id="6137497">I'm sorry for your loss.</string>
  <string id="6137500">My mother is dead. My heart's broken.</string>
  <string id="6137501">Heartbroken.</string>
  <string id="6137502">I suppose I could say at least you knew yours, but that seems more about me than you.</string>
  <string id="6137508">I have a smile on my face. That should be enough for most people.</string>
  <string id="6137509">I am fine. Really. </string>
  <string id="6137510">Maybe we're not friends but... I knew her too. I want to think my mother was like her.</string>
  <string id="6137513">That doesn't work on me. I knew her, too. I want to think my mother was like her.</string>
  <string id="6137516">I just have flashes of... impossibly long hair.</string>
  <string id="6137519">But my father... would you like to hear one thing?</string>
  <string id="6137520">You've never talked about him.</string>
  <string id="6137521">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6137522">My father trained me in all the skills he had been forced to give up. He spent everything to get me into Cailan's service.</string>
  <string id="6137525">Do you know what I remember?</string>
  <string id="6137528">When he read to me—stupid things, dragons and heroes—he wouldn't turn a page until I reached over and took his hand.</string>
  <string id="6137531">That big man made every step of the story my choice.</string>
  <string id="6137534">I loved that.</string>
  <string id="6137537">He died of the wasting in a Denerim ward... those last weeks, I read to him.</string>
  <string id="6137540">I had to take his hand to turn the pages. And I couldn't tell if he was too weak, or if it was the old game.</string>
  <string id="6137543">He smiled at that, at his big girl.</string>
  <string id="6137546">Laughs I don't know why I'm telling you this.</string>
  <string id="6137549">Drink?</string>
  <string id="6137550">I don't think so.</string>
  <string id="6137551">No.</string>
  <string id="6137552">Good. Feel it. Everything. Wallow in it.</string>
  <string id="6137555">I could use one.</string>
  <string id="6137556">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6137557">As much, or as little as you want. No one tells you how to mourn.</string>
  <string id="6137560">And when someone says move on, you take their hand and say my choice.</string>
  <string id="6137563">That's all I have. I'll miss her too.</string>
  <string id="6137566">I've had more than enough opportunity for kind words. I'm full up.</string>
  <string id="6137567">Not a chance.</string>
  <string id="6137568">She was your mother. You're allowed to be an ass about this. Just... remember that there are people who care.</string>
  <string id="6137574">Even if sometimes they don't know why.</string>
  <string id="6137577">I'm just going to let it go for a while. But I appreciate the thought.</string>
  <string id="6137578">Thank you, but no.</string>
  <string id="6137579">Good. Maybe that's enough.</string>
  <string id="6137582">You're a bit difficult sometimes, Hawke. The best people are. Remember that.</string>
  <string id="6137585">If you need anything, go ahead and get it yourself. That's what I needed, and we're not so different.</string>
  <string id="6137588">What is it about death that brings out the speeches?</string>
  <string id="6137589">Just one? I doubt it.</string>
  <string id="6137590">Maybe people think it's something they can share.</string>
  <string id="6137593">That's the human response, anyway. I'm not sure what you're doing.</string>
  <string id="6137596">Don't lose your friends too, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6137602">You told Veld you had the gem. Were you lying?</string>
  <string id="6137603">Tell me about this gem.</string>
  <string id="6137604">You set this whole thing up just so you could meet your father?</string>
  <string id="6137605">So this was all for Gamlen?</string>
  <string id="6137608">I just wanted to see—I don't know—how far he'd go for something he really wanted.</string>
  <string id="6137611">And then he doesn't even show up. I baited him with the one thing I thought would get his attention.</string>
  <string id="6137614">She told me about Gamlen before she died last year. I didn't even know about him.</string>
  <string id="6137617">I guess I should take that as a compliment.</string>
  <string id="6137618">Not at all. I found the gem. I managed to pull off what Gamlen couldn't.</string>
  <string id="6137619">It seems odd you don't feel a kinship. You don't feel the name fits you?</string>
  <string id="6137620">No respect for your namesake?</string>
  <string id="6137621">He's got some good qualities. You might be surprised.</string>
  <string id="6137622">Gamlen's not so bad.</string>
  <string id="6137623">Really? What do you think I should do?</string>
  <string id="6137627">Gamlen's an ass.</string>
  <string id="6137628">Yet you still treat him like family. There must be something good about him.</string>
  <string id="6137631">I don't know what to do. What do you think?</string>
  <string id="6137632">I wouldn't get my hopes up. Gamlen is unreliable at best.</string>
  <string id="6137635">He isn't very trustworthy. And he smells.</string>
  <string id="6137638">He cheats, lies, and steals. I wouldn't trust him, if I were you.</string>
  <string id="6137641">I'm really only here for the gem. I don't care about your problems.</string>
  <string id="6137642">Give me the gem.</string>
  <string id="6137643">You're an ass. If Gamlen is anything like you, I don't need him in my life.</string>
  <string id="6137648">This must be a very different pace from serving King Cailan.</string>
  <string id="6137649">Do you miss being a soldier?</string>
  <string id="6137650">I loved that life, but there's a new king for a new Ferelden.</string>
  <string id="6137653">Seems cocksure, but I guess he was there when the Archdemon fell. Can't fault an active hand.</string>
  <string id="6137655">It's been a year settling in. Are you... all right?</string>
  <string id="6137656">Do you miss Wesley?</string>
  <string id="6137657">I didn't choose my name. Aveline was a wish my father made.</string>
  <string id="6137666">I am similar to what he pictured, but that's because of what I try to be, not what I assume I should.</string>
  <string id="6137669">A bit free in his affairs, I understand, but he was there when the Archdemon fell.</string>
  <string id="6137674">A good family name. I've heard very little about him. He'll find a voice or be left behind.</string>
  <string id="6137677">It's just one more change, though. The real end for me was Ostagar.</string>
  <string id="6137680">You and Carver must have felt something similar.</string>
  <string id="6137683">I don't know if that's right to say. I barely knew him.</string>
  <string id="6137686">Death on that scale certainly has a finality to it.</string>
  <string id="6137687">No, you're right.</string>
  <string id="6137688">I don't dwell on it. I guess we had that in common.</string>
  <string id="6137689">We didn't talk about it.</string>
  <string id="6137690">Carver was there. I imagine he feels something similar. If he allows it.</string>
  <string id="6137691">It wasn't the first village I saw fall. But you don't get used to people losing everything.</string>
  <string id="6137692">I'd been away already. I don't know if I'd still call it home.</string>
  <string id="6137693">I only went back to fight.</string>
  <string id="6137694">Sometimes, the best thing about a place is that it's where you're from.</string>
  <string id="6137695">It's not how I wanted to say goodbye, I'll say that.</string>
  <string id="6137696">It was sad to leave that way.</string>
  <string id="6137697">You can't go home again. That's supposed to be about maturity. It's not the same if you don't have the option.</string>
  <string id="6137698">What about you, Carver? You were there. Do you feel something similar?</string>
  <string id="6137701">No.</string>
  <string id="6137704">All right, then.</string>
  <string id="6137707">Bit of a tit, your brother.</string>
  <string id="6137709">Then I would have liked him.</string>
  <string id="6137710">Sometimes I wonder.</string>
  <string id="6137711">You don't need to coddle me. I am where I am.</string>
  <string id="6137714">Would you hear me if I said yes?</string>
  <string id="6137717">How close I hold my memories is my own business.</string>
  <string id="6137720">Is there anyone else who so embodies how far this city has fallen?</string>
  <string id="6137721">You have failed this city! Your men stand with me because of your inability to lead!</string>
  <string id="6138720">You... disgrace the guard.</string>
  <string id="6138721">You took it from yourself! The guard know this, and none stand with you!</string>
  <string id="6138724">He stands alone! This is no rebellion. It is delusion! A joke inflicted on Kirkwall! Your home, and mine!</string>
  <string id="6138725">What about it, Aveline? If you had their loyalty, he'd have no support.</string>
  <string id="6138726">Is he right about the guards?</string>
  <string id="6138727">You're right.</string>
  <string id="6138730">Jeven is right! I have failed you! I can correct that, but not if you stand with him!</string>
  <string id="6138733">I won't have you dishonored like this!</string>
  <string id="6138737">He's planted a bad seed. These men have made a choice you can't allow.</string>
  <string id="6138738">Kill the traitors, Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6138739">You're not involved in this, Champion!</string>
  <string id="6138742">I am now. And it ends!</string>
  <string id="6138745">You're right.</string>
  <string id="6138748">If you stand with this... corruption, you're no longer of the guard!</string>
  <string id="6138751">A gangrenous limb must be cut away.</string>
  <string id="6138754">Tough words, but you won't beat me again!</string>
  <string id="6138757">I could not protect these men from this... bad decision. But I will protect the rest.</string>
  <string id="6138760">Hear me! I am your Champion! I stood with you against Qunari!</string>
  <string id="6138761">Some of you were with Varnell.</string>
  <string id="6138765">A Champion who went on to appease the Arishok. Who will you give in to next?</string>
  <string id="6138768">One life to save many, Jeven. You've done as much for coin alone!</string>
  <string id="6138771">This... is isn't about you! Stop that!</string>
  <string id="6138774">A lot has changed in six years, Jeven. You've been left behind!</string>
  <string id="6138780">No. You shall have less.</string>
  <string id="6138789">Well... nothing to say?</string>
  <string id="6138792">Admitting fault seemed to help. It will go over well in the barracks.</string>
  <string id="6138795">Aveline?</string>
  <string id="6138799">I couldn't save them.</string>
  <string id="6138802">They asked for it.</string>
  <string id="6138805">It couldn't be helped.</string>
  <string id="6138808">Win some, kill some?</string>
  <string id="6138811">It doesn't matter. I need to... go back to the barracks.</string>
  <string id="6138815">That wasn't your place, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6138818">He made it my place.</string>
  <string id="6138821">I don't have the patience for that type.</string>
  <string id="6138824">It felt good, though.</string>
  <string id="6138827">My guardsmen will be waiting in the barracks.</string>
  <string id="6138831">You fool. Why would you do this?</string>
  <string id="6139051">I couldn't protect them, Hawke. I swore it wouldn't come to this.</string>
  <string id="6139069">I'm resigning.</string>
  <string id="6139070">Don't abandon the good ones.</string>
  <string id="6139071">You culled the weak.</string>
  <string id="6139075">What would the count be without you?</string>
  <string id="6139076">You've saved plenty.</string>
  <string id="6139077">I don't know, but I'm tired of being responsible for it.</string>
  <string id="6139080">It'll take time, same as when I took the job. But I'm through risking people.</string>
  <string id="6139083">I am through.</string>
  <string id="6139086">People die. I'll make more. I get around.</string>
  <string id="6139087">It's not that big of a deal.</string>
  <string id="6139117">Aveline?</string>
  <string id="6139118">Look, if this is about what I said to Jeven, he was a fool.</string>
  <string id="6139119">So I blamed you. Toughen up.</string>
  <string id="6139120">I understand you're mad, but I was right, and pointing it out helped.</string>
  <string id="6139121">Jeven had a fair point.</string>
  <string id="6139122">I was a little harsh out there, but whatever helps, right?</string>
  <string id="6139123">Sorry I made you look bad.</string>
  <string id="6139127">You're right. Making me look weak saved lives.</string>
  <string id="6139130">Never again. Do you hear me? Never.</string>
  <string id="6139136">It wasn't your place. Champion or not, this was my concern, not yours.</string>
  <string id="6139140">Jeven. Son of a bitch.</string>
  <string id="6139143">You build a good thing, work your hardest, and the past just claws at you.</string>
  <string id="6139144">There was nothing he could do to you. Your men are loyal.</string>
  <string id="6139145">No guards stood with him.</string>
  <string id="6139146">Are they? I built a name for them, but this kind of thing harms them all.</string>
  <string id="6139149">Jeven failed before he started. You know this.</string>
  <string id="6139150">He was a broken fool.</string>
  <string id="6139151">I do, and he doomed himself. But it smears all of the guard.</string>
  <string id="6139154">Tell me about it. I can't go twenty minutes without getting jumped.</string>
  <string id="6139155">Happens all the time.</string>
  <string id="6139156">But when does it start to hurt those you care about? I've tried to lead well, but this...</string>
  <string id="6139159">I wonder what I would do if my captain lost my respect.</string>
  <string id="6139165">Captain? We're waiting for orders.</string>
  <string id="6139168">Make do, Guardsman.</string>
  <string id="6139174">If you don't mind, Hawke. I'd like some time.</string>
  <string id="6139177">Will you accept them?</string>
  <string id="6139180">May I speak freely?</string>
  <string id="6139183">There isn't a man or woman here who wouldn't follow you through the Void.</string>
  <string id="6139186">Captain.</string>
  <string id="6139189">You're a bitch. But you're ours. The doubters are dead, and we still need you.</string>
  <string id="6139192">Captain.</string>
  <string id="6139198">I'll take it.</string>
  <string id="6139204">If you'll excuse me, Hawke. My guardsmen need me.</string>
  <string id="6139210">Jeven is in Lowtown. Let's not keep him waiting.</string>
  <string id="6139214">I need to go to Lowtown. Guardsman Brennan has some explaining to do.</string>
  <string id="6139218">I want to go with you to Cullen so I can see his face when you tell him about Donnic's patrol.</string>
  <string id="6139222">Let's go, Hawke. We'll intercept Donnic on his patrol and see what special treatment I give my men.</string>
  <string id="6139229">You have no viscount. It's clear you are suffering without... sufficient leadership.</string>
  <string id="6139232">That doesn't grant default authority to you or your commander.</string>
  <string id="6139235">It would be easier if you cooperated.</string>
  <string id="6139238">Wouldn't it.</string>
  <string id="6139241">Guard-Captain.</string>
  <string id="6139244">Trouble?</string>
  <string id="6139247">Yes! He's been hounding me. These templars strut around as it is, but now it's just... out of hand.</string>
  <string id="6139248">If you're going to coddle your men, expect someone to take issue.</string>
  <string id="6139249">Your own fault, apparently.</string>
  <string id="6139250">What in blazes are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="6139253">Cullen has heard complaints about you as captain.</string>
  <string id="6139256">Complaints? From who?</string>
  <string id="6139257">Who cares? I need to know if you're going soft.</string>
  <string id="6139258">Doesn't matter. Is it true?</string>
  <string id="6139259">I don't like what you're implying.</string>
  <string id="6139262">It's a simple question.</string>
  <string id="6139265">Then let me give them, and you, an answer.</string>
  <string id="6139268">If they think I'm coddling anyone, it'll be my husband, Donnic. You and I will intercept his patrol tonight.</string>
  <string id="6139271">Guardsman Donnic is on patrol this evening. You and I will intercept for a surprise inspection.</string>
  <string id="6139274">Then you can see for yourself if I'm coddling him. Or any in my command.</string>
  <string id="6139275">Well, I could do with a breath of fresh air.</string>
  <string id="6139276">A stroll will be nice.</string>
  <string id="6139277">No names given, of course.</string>
  <string id="6139278">Anonymous lies.</string>
  <string id="6139279">No wonder the lieutenant was harassing me. Bastards.</string>
  <string id="6139294">Knight-Captain Cullen has heard some troubling things.</string>
  <string id="6139295">There are complaints about you.</string>
  <string id="6139296">Such as...?</string>
  <string id="6139299">That you coddle the men. Give special treatment.</string>
  <string id="6139302">Someone... has dared? Who? Who accuses me of this?</string>
  <string id="6139303">I think it's more important to answer the accusation.</string>
  <string id="6139304">That's for later. Is it true?</string>
  <string id="6139305">You think it's true!</string>
  <string id="6139308">I think someone thinks it's true.</string>
  <string id="6139311">He could be fishing for a less strenuous position here in the barracks.</string>
  <string id="6139312">Maybe he wants an easier job.</string>
  <string id="6139313">Well he won't be getting one from me.</string>
  <string id="6139316">That's not what Cullen has heard.</string>
  <string id="6139319">What are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="6139320">Word is, you're coddling your men. Playing favorites.</string>
  <string id="6139321">You're apparently a lazy boss.</string>
  <string id="6139322">And you believe this?</string>
  <string id="6139325">Someone does. Enough to write the knight-captain.</string>
  <string id="6139328">That you coddle your men. It's all lies, of course. But it's out there.</string>
  <string id="6139329">Unfounded accusations.</string>
  <string id="6139380">I do what you can't, and you've taken advantage more than once.</string>
  <string id="6139381">Liar. Then why bring me?</string>
  <string id="6139382">I've fought people like that before. It's no big deal.</string>
  <string id="6139383">He wanted a fight. He got it.</string>
  <string id="6139384">The guards saw their captain attacked on one side and propped up on the other!</string>
  <string id="6139386">You weren't good enough.</string>
  <string id="6139387">You claim their loyalty, but maybe that's not enough.</string>
  <string id="6139388">If you can't hold their loyalty, that's not my fault.</string>
  <string id="6139391">You say Gamlen is obsessed with this gem, but he never mentioned it before your note turned up.</string>
  <string id="6139392">Gamlen never spoke of the gem.</string>
  <string id="6139393">Maybe he didn't want you to know about it.</string>
  <string id="6139396">I guess I wanted to see for myself.</string>
  <string id="6139399">They saw a captain with powerful friends.</string>
  <string id="6139402">They saw their captain wisely step back.</string>
  <string id="6139405">It's over. We won.</string>
  <string id="6139413">Get out, Hawke. My guardsmen need me.</string>
  <string id="6139419">Did you know I've been dead for seven years?</string>
  <string id="6139422">I got word last week. They only just sorted the casualties of Ostagar.</string>
  <string id="6139425">The king has offered to reinstate the commission of any surviving officers who will return to Ferelden.</string>
  <string id="6139429">He mentioned he lost a lot searching for the gem. Maybe he gave up on it.</string>
  <string id="6139430">Or perhaps he's changed.</string>
  <string id="6139431">That would be a surprise, to say the least.</string>
  <string id="6139432">What kind of mother would stop her daughter from meeting her own father?</string>
  <string id="6139433">Your mother hid him from you?</string>
  <string id="6139434">I don't blame her. She thought she was protecting me. She didn't want me to get hurt the way she did.</string>
  <string id="6139441">Do you recognize this bill of lading, Uncle?</string>
  <string id="6139444">I was just ambushed by a group of men who were trying to capture you.</string>
  <string id="6139454">Laughs</string>
  <string id="6139457">And then he says... he says, I swear I had two when I came in here.</string>
  <string id="6139460">You know those stains never came out!</string>
  <string id="6139463">You are horrible. Every inch.</string>
  <string id="6139466">You love it, big girl. And you owe me for the bottle.</string>
  <string id="6139469">Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6139472">She's not so bad. Except when she is.</string>
  <string id="6139478">Laughs</string>
  <string id="6139481">And so I said, it's a kingdom, and that makes him king. But it's also a country.</string>
  <string id="6139484">I find interrogations are better as a two-way affair.</string>
  <string id="6139487">You have no sense in your head. None at all.</string>
  <string id="6139490">You're the real guardian of such things. Keep the bottle.</string>
  <string id="6139493">Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6139496">Incorrigible. Utterly.</string>
  <string id="6139504">And?</string>
  <string id="6139507">And what?</string>
  <string id="6139508">Does this appeal matter? I thought you were sworn to Cailan.</string>
  <string id="6139509">You served a different king.</string>
  <string id="6139510">King Alistair has apparently become something of a sensation. A champion of hope.</string>
  <string id="6139519">If the current king is wrong for the position, well, he's a Warden. They don't live long.</string>
  <string id="6139522">I'm sorry. I hope Carver is well.</string>
  <string id="6139525">I'm sorry. I hope Bethany is well.</string>
  <string id="6139528">Regardless of who has the throne, I served Ferelden. The country survives, even if Cailan didn't.</string>
  <string id="6139529">You brought it up. What's your decision?</string>
  <string id="6139530">What will you do?</string>
  <string id="6139533">Maybe it's for the best. Kirkwall has been a struggle.</string>
  <string id="6139534">I'd consider it.</string>
  <string id="6139535">Well, that should be an easy call. You've already decided to walk away.</string>
  <string id="6139536">You're quitting anyway.</string>
  <string id="6139539">Should I?</string>
  <string id="6139542">Hey, there's another damned note on the back of this! Get out of here, girl.</string>
  <string id="6139543">Hey, there's another damned note on the back of this! Get out of here, boy.</string>
  <string id="6139550">Why? Oh, beggar it all! You're still following those stupid notes, aren't you?</string>
  <string id="6139563">It's been a strange time here in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6139566">I did say that, didn't I?</string>
  <string id="6139570">It has. For everyone.</string>
  <string id="6139573">Did Carver ever tell you about that last night at Ostagar? How it happened?</string>
  <string id="6139574">Do you ever think about that last night at Ostagar? How it happened?</string>
  <string id="6139601">I don't mean the betrayal—everyone knows the signal went up and the flanking charge never came.</string>
  <string id="6139609">Fine, I don't care if you go.</string>
  <string id="6139610">You know I'm your friend, Aveline, but don't string me along.</string>
  <string id="6139613">Serves you right, chasing after that gem.</string>
  <string id="6139619">It was the oddest feeling. Hope answered with... nothing.</string>
  <string id="6139622">I don't like the thought of going out with a whimper, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6139629">Not again.</string>
  <string id="6139630">You've already made up your mind.</string>
  <string id="6139631">That sounded decisive.</string>
  <string id="6139635">I can't keep a straight face for anything. But I wasn't always so sure.</string>
  <string id="6139638">Thank you for everything. I have so much because of you.</string>
  <string id="6139644">You'd walk all over a new captain. I could never subject these men to that.</string>
  <string id="6139650">I'm here for you, Hawke. And for myself.</string>
  <string id="6139653">You enjoyed stringing me along too much.</string>
  <string id="6139654">You are such a tease.</string>
  <string id="6139655">Shock of shocks, you're staying.</string>
  <string id="6139656">That was so obvious!</string>
  <string id="6139657">But that's where I'm at.</string>
  <string id="6139658">There's no debate. This is where you belong.</string>
  <string id="6139659">You're not going.</string>
  <string id="6139660">It's not that simple.</string>
  <string id="6139663">I won't let you make this mistake.</string>
  <string id="6139666">You won't let me?</string>
  <string id="6139667">I'm ready to take this to the ground if that's what it will take.</string>
  <string id="6139668">We can fight if you want.</string>
  <string id="6139670">We can dig into this if you want, but you know it will be embarrassing.</string>
  <string id="6139671">You don't want me to.</string>
  <string id="6139672">What other guard would let me get away with so much?</string>
  <string id="6139673">I'm used to you.</string>
  <string id="6139674">Do you want my permission? If you've already given up, take responsibility.</string>
  <string id="6139675">It's an excuse to be a coward.</string>
  <string id="6139676">Who are you to talk about responsibility? You're a highwayman. You stumbled into being Champion.</string>
  <string id="6139679">Time and again I have tried to keep people safe, and time and again, they are taken!</string>
  <string id="6139682">I know where the fault lies. I will not be judged a coward by anyone!</string>
  <string id="6139683">You don't have the darkspawn as an excuse for running this time!</string>
  <string id="6139684">Leave and you admit it.</string>
  <string id="6139685">I would brave anything for my guards!</string>
  <string id="6139688">Except your wounded pride. How many should die while you flee that?</string>
  <string id="6139691">Screams</string>
  <string id="6139700">Laughs That's not someone who wants to walk away.</string>
  <string id="6139703">You are... such a bitch.</string>
  <string id="6139704">You are... such an ass.</string>
  <string id="6139705">No more arguing, or next time I fight back.</string>
  <string id="6139706">You're staying. Period.</string>
  <string id="6139707">Not the most sophisticated method, but a win is a win.</string>
  <string id="6139708">But it worked.</string>
  <string id="6139709">I may be the biggest pain you know, but you're at the top of my list.</string>
  <string id="6139710">Look who's talking.</string>
  <string id="6139711">Then we have nothing more to say.</string>
  <string id="6139712">Goodbye, Captain.</string>
  <string id="6139713">I... I suppose not.</string>
  <string id="6139716">It will take a while to arrange things. I can help you in the meantime, but...</string>
  <string id="6139724">It doesn't sound like there's anything else to say.</string>
  <string id="6139725">Then I am sorry to see you go.</string>
  <string id="6139726">Whimper or whine, you've already said you're quitting.</string>
  <string id="6139727">You already decided. Leave.</string>
  <string id="6139728">It's like you take joy in it.</string>
  <string id="6139729">All right. Right to the point.</string>
  <string id="6139730">You brought it up. Keep it to yourself if that's what you want.</string>
  <string id="6139733">You ask a lot of me, Hawke. And you give me no end of trouble. Maybe changing that is what I need.</string>
  <string id="6139736">I won't tell you. And you won't find out. I think...</string>
  <string id="6139739">I'll still travel with you, if you need. But only for the good of the city.</string>
  <string id="6139742">Leave me, Serah Hawke. We're through.</string>
  <string id="6139745">It's hard to imagine they could be worse off.</string>
  <string id="6139750">Thanks, but I doubt you could keep up.</string>
  <string id="6139756">I'm resigning.</string>
  <string id="6139762">But what is here for me? Just more doubt from you.</string>
  <string id="6139765">But that moment when the tower lit and then... the fight just kept going.</string>
  <string id="6139768">That won't be necessary.</string>
  <string id="6139775">That all there is to it, hmm?</string>
  <string id="6139778">There never was much point arguing with you. I've always liked that. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6139781">Next time. Laughs</string>
  <string id="6139784">Whatever the means, is that it?</string>
  <string id="6139787">It's nice to be appreciated.</string>
  <string id="6139790">I always knew there was a limit to how much I'd take from you.</string>
  <string id="6139793">I never thought I'd be grateful to be pushed past it.</string>
  <string id="6139796">You're something. You know that? I'm here for you.</string>
  <string id="6139799">But... let's not make a habit of this.</string>
  <string id="6139805">Guardsmen! Duties for the week will be...</string>
  <string id="6139808">Lowtown canvass. Five on, three off.</string>
  <string id="6139811">City perimeter by twos, clear by second watch.</string>
  <string id="6139814">Training recruits. Full metal by week's end.</string>
  <string id="6139817">Anything else, Captain?</string>
  <string id="6139820">No. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6139823">By your order, Captain!</string>
  <string id="6139826">Good job. Get it done.</string>
  <string id="6139832">Donnic is... a good man.</string>
  <string id="6139839">I'm sorry, was there something you wanted?</string>
  <string id="6139840">You've had some discipline problems?</string>
  <string id="6139841">Some of the men are difficult?</string>
  <string id="6139842">Your men could give the templars a run for their sovereigns.</string>
  <string id="6139843">The guards look well-trained.</string>
  <string id="6139844">They've had to. As long as there's no viscount, the Order thinks they can bark at any man in uniform.</string>
  <string id="6139845">You never said how your three weeks in Orlais went.</string>
  <string id="6139846">How was the honeymoon?</string>
  <string id="6139847">You're right. I didn't.</string>
  <string id="6139850">Ooh. Shivery.</string>
  <string id="6139853">So how was it?</string>
  <string id="6139856">Oh. Laughs</string>
  <string id="6139859">Phoo. Hot in here.</string>
  <string id="6139862">Well. Good for you.</string>
  <string id="6139865">Yes, yes. Wonder of wonders.</string>
  <string id="6139868">Anything else?</string>
  <string id="6139869">I thought you were only the interim captain.</string>
  <string id="6139870">Wasn't this job temporary?</string>
  <string id="6139871">Just checking in. Need anything?</string>
  <string id="6139872">Anything going on?</string>
  <string id="6139873">Yes, there's something. Come back soon. I'll get into it then.</string>
  <string id="6139877">I'll see you later.</string>
  <string id="6139878">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="6139879">Of course, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6139880">Donnic is... difficult, but they all appreciate what I do.</string>
  <string id="6139883">What do you need?</string>
  <string id="6139884">Laughs Not for much longer if this goes bad.</string>
  <string id="6139887">We're in for a mess, now. How do you talk me into these things?</string>
  <string id="6139890">What a mess. You really put loyalty to the test, you know?</string>
  <string id="6139896">Donnic has kept the guard protecting civilians. Meredith will have no support from them.</string>
  <string id="6139899">You know I'll never forgive you for this, right? Some of my guards, they stand with the templars.</string>
  <string id="6139902">With luck... well, let's just say we need some luck.</string>
  <string id="6139908">Donnic has kept the guard protecting civilians. It's been contained so far but... we really need some luck going ahead.</string>
  <string id="6139909">Aveline, I need to have your men fighting up front.</string>
  <string id="6139910">The guards must fight with us.</string>
  <string id="6139911">It's not their war. They've been pressed just keeping order on the side streets.</string>
  <string id="6139914">You know I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.</string>
  <string id="6139917">You may as well tear open the Void.</string>
  <string id="6139920">All right. I'll send word. Donnic will know what to do.</string>
  <string id="6139923">I just hope you do, as well.</string>
  <string id="6139926">I tried to keep the guards out of this but... there've been losses. I'm going to hate you for this.</string>
  <string id="6139927">I have Aveline, the captain of the guard. I'm not worried.</string>
  <string id="6139928">I know we will win, Captain.</string>
  <string id="6139929">You're right mad, sometimes. You know that?</string>
  <string id="6139930">Ever forward, is that it? I'm with you.</string>
  <string id="6139932">I'm glad you're here.</string>
  <string id="6139933">I know I make life hard for you. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6139936">Laughs You're welcome.</string>
  <string id="6139939">You're a piece of work, you know? The Maker...</string>
  <string id="6139942">The Maker will be honored to have you at His side.</string>
  <string id="6139945">I never wanted to mess up your life like this.</string>
  <string id="6139948">I think it's something that just sort of happens to friends of yours.</string>
  <string id="6139951">Hawke? It's worth it.</string>
  <string id="6139954">Let's bust some heads like the old days.</string>
  <string id="6139957">Starting to doubt me?</string>
  <string id="6139958">Regrets?</string>
  <string id="6139959">Starting? Laughs</string>
  <string id="6139962">These aren't darkspawn. These were brothers of some sort just days ago.</string>
  <string id="6139965">Don't make a bloody mess of it.</string>
  <string id="6139968">Never.</string>
  <string id="6139971">Almost never.</string>
  <string id="6139974">Let's keep the damage to a minimum, shall we? I've walked away from too many wastelands for one lifetime.</string>
  <string id="6139980">You've asked for everything, Hawke. Make it count.</string>
  <string id="6139983">Somehow I think our troubles are just starting.</string>
  <string id="6139986">But! A good cause trumps good sense any day.</string>
  <string id="6139989">I'm ready, Champion. As I'll ever be.</string>
  <string id="6139992">I hope you're right about all of this. History doesn't care about good intentions.</string>
  <string id="6139995">I'm ready. Say the word.</string>
  <string id="6140002">I just hope there's a Kirkwall for us to come back to.</string>
  <string id="6140005">One that will have us.</string>
  <string id="6140014">Guard up, mage.</string>
  <string id="6140017">Why in the name of the Maker would I need to train with a sword...?</string>
  <string id="6140020">Hey!</string>
  <string id="6140023">It doesn't matter how strong your spirit is if you're full of holes.</string>
  <string id="6140026">I don't know how you people get through life without magic...</string>
  <string id="6140032">Defensive stance, warrior.</string>
  <string id="6140035">My skills are in excellent form, Aveline. There is no...</string>
  <string id="6140041">Instinct serves you well. Or do you serve it?</string>
  <string id="6140044">I have not decided.</string>
  <string id="6140068">Guard up, girl.</string>
  <string id="6140071">Now, I don't usually train like this, so thank...</string>
  <string id="6140074">Shrieks</string>
  <string id="6140077">Keep in the moment, or you'll never have another.</string>
  <string id="6140080">Do that again!</string>
  <string id="6140127">I won't have it. The people of Kirkwall need to see themselves in their guard.</string>
  <string id="6140130">Lose that connection, we're just targets.</string>
  <string id="6140131">Kirkwall seems to have rallied around you.</string>
  <string id="6140132">You've settled in as captain?</string>
  <string id="6140133">I try to keep order, and people appreciate that. Everything else is going insane.</string>
  <string id="6140136">A few complaints here and there, but for the most part, I think everyone's just glad the guard has been stable for a few years.</string>
  <string id="6140137">I haven't. They have, but they get over it.</string>
  <string id="6140140">I find it helps to point at how many of them retired due to injury and death before I took over.</string>
  <string id="6140143">I'll take their scorn if they live to give it.</string>
  <string id="6140144">The death of the viscount made my position a little more permanent.</string>
  <string id="6140147">As much as the templars might want to take my authority, they don't seem to want my job.</string>
  <string id="6140150">I think they've overtaxed themselves. Poor dears.</string>
  <string id="6140157">Blissfully quiet at the moment. I'm sure it won't last.</string>
  <string id="6140164">Alistair</string>
  <string id="6140169">The dwarven traitors have been dealt with.</string>
  <string id="6140172">Our faith in you was well placed. Here you go.</string>
  <string id="6140175">If anyone asks, the viscount had nothing to do with this, right?</string>
  <string id="6140178">Just get rid of the dwarven traitors. I don't care how. And don't worry about the guards.</string>
  <string id="6140179">I thought you said we could rely on the Fereldan. Any other brilliant ideas?</string>
  <string id="6140180">Refugees like you aren't the city's only problem these days.</string>
  <string id="6140183">Our latest headache is a demand from the king of Orzammar that we execute several dwarven traitors operating in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6140186">King Harrowmont's request is tricky because the traitors are in the employ of his rival, Prince Bhelen.</string>
  <string id="6140189">So we need someone... with a talent for violence to make these traitors disappear. Unofficially.</string>
  <string id="6140190">The viscount employs guards doesn't he? Why do you need me?</string>
  <string id="6140191">Why not do it yourself?</string>
  <string id="6140192">Many dwarves believe Prince Bhelen should've been crowned king, apparently.</string>
  <string id="6140195">And most of the Carta support Bhelen. If the city acts openly...</string>
  <string id="6140198">So the viscount wants them murdered, instead.</string>
  <string id="6140201">He wants it dealt with. He set Seneschal Bran on it. Who then set me on it. So now it's on my hide.</string>
  <string id="6140202">I'm not an executioner. Find someone else.</string>
  <string id="6140203">I'll pass.</string>
  <string id="6140204">Pity.</string>
  <string id="6140207">Just tell me who I'm after.</string>
  <string id="6140208">I'll do it.</string>
  <string id="6140209">The traitors dabble in smuggling. Their leader is meeting someone in Hightown—right now.</string>
  <string id="6140212">And their base. Remember?</string>
  <string id="6140215">Right. And they have some sort of base in Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6140218">Handle this and you will be well compensated.</string>
  <string id="6140221">You're Hawke, right? Someone wants to see you by the brothel.</string>
  <string id="6140224">Anything else?</string>
  <string id="6140227">No. Sounds important, though!</string>
  <string id="6140232">Alistair</string>
  <string id="6140234">Them's the ones that was talking with Ser Ivhan. Make an example of them.</string>
  <string id="6140235">Mind your own sodding business.</string>
  <string id="6140240">You came.</string>
  <string id="6140244">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="6140247">You probably thought you got away with it. Ser Karras and the others' deaths. Do you even remember them?</string>
  <string id="6140250">They were searching for the missing Starkhaven apostates and were murdered.</string>
  <string id="6140255">Maker guide you, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6140256">My apologies about your mother, Hawke. We should have apprehended that mage before it went so far.</string>
  <string id="6140257">The mages are restless. Even in Ferelden, they did not resist us so openly... until the end.</string>
  <string id="6140261">Hawke! The new scion of the Amell family... Congratulations.</string>
  <string id="6140264">I knew an Amell once.</string>
  <string id="6140267">She was a special woman. Never met her like again.</string>
  <string id="6140270">He left the tower before Uldred's insanity, then came back to rescue us all.</string>
  <string id="6140273">I hear that elf-blood boy you brought in isn't doing so well, though. Poor lad's near on his deathbed.</string>
  <string id="6140274">Do you mean Feynriel? What's wrong with him?</string>
  <string id="6140275">Elf-blood boy?</string>
  <string id="6140276">They say he's lying senseless in bed and cannot be roused.</string>
  <string id="6140279">First Enchanter Orsino won't let anyone enter his room. Even his own mother has been turned away.</string>
  <string id="6140283">Anyway, what can I do for you?</string>
  <string id="6140284">Is there anything I can help the templars with?</string>
  <string id="6140285">Do you have work for me?</string>
  <string id="6140286">You're kind to offer, but after what happened with Tarohne three years ago, the knight-commander has closed ranks.</string>
  <string id="6140289">Our own men undergo weekly questioning, and she's eliminated all work with outsiders.</string>
  <string id="6140292">It's hard to keep recruitment up enough to maintain our numbers.</string>
  <string id="6140293">Someone told me the templars are working on a plan to turn all mages Tranquil. Is this true?</string>
  <string id="6140294">What's the Tranquil Solution?</string>
  <string id="6140295">It is... an idea that was discussed. But there are no plans to go through with it.</string>
  <string id="6140298">Your Ser Alrik was working on a plan to turn all mages Tranquil.</string>
  <string id="6140299">You should see these papers.</string>
  <string id="6140300">I will not ask how you came by the personal effects of a man recently murdered within our own walls.</string>
  <string id="6140303">It's true there has been some discussion of the idea. But as you can see, it has gone no further than that.</string>
  <string id="6140306">The Harrowing has served us well enough for centuries.</string>
  <string id="6140309">It will be up to mages themselves whether they push us to more stringent measures.</string>
  <string id="6140310">It sounds like you support this.</string>
  <string id="6140311">Do you approve of the plan?</string>
  <string id="6140312">The Tranquil ritual was created as a mercy so that mages need not be killed out of hand for a threat they might pose.</string>
  <string id="6140315">There is an argument to be made for applying it more widely.</string>
  <string id="6140318">But many mages have made it clear they view the ritual as no better than death. They want no controls on them at all.</string>
  <string id="6140319">Everyone seems concerned about the Qunari. What's the templars' stance?</string>
  <string id="6140320">How do you feel about Qunari?</string>
  <string id="6140321">They are heathens. They will stop at nothing less than the eradication of the Chantry.</string>
  <string id="6140324">But we can't know the immediate goals of the Qunari in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6140327">Should it come to open conflict, we are the largest army in the city. We will be the ones to lead its defense.</string>
  <string id="6140328">I keep hearing about the knight-commander. When do I get to meet her?</string>
  <string id="6140329">I want to meet Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6140330">I'm afraid she's become more reclusive since you came to Kirkwall, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6140333">These last three years, especially, she's been very suspicious of outside influences.</string>
  <string id="6140336">I almost wonder if something happened.</string>
  <string id="6140337">I was just leaving.</string>
  <string id="6140338">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="6140339">Maker watch over you.</string>
  <string id="6140344">Take your false sympathy somewhere else.</string>
  <string id="6140347">An inquiry determined the apostates must have killed the templars. But I've suspected for years that Ser Thrask and you were responsible.</string>
  <string id="6140348">Suspect all you like, but you can't prove I was involved.</string>
  <string id="6140349">You have no proof.</string>
  <string id="6140352">So you're here to beat a confession out of me?</string>
  <string id="6140353">Why are you here?</string>
  <string id="6140354">I wouldn't let them take the apostates. Then Ser Karras ordered his men to attack.</string>
  <string id="6140355">They struck first.</string>

  <string id="6140559">I knew it. You stood in the way of their holy duty, and you think that excuses your actions?</string>
  <string id="6140562">My brothers, tonight justice will be done.</string>
  <string id="6140574">Welcome to the best little tavern in Kirkwall!</string>
  <string id="6140575">Don't mind the drunks. They're friendlier than they look. And they don't bite, much.</string>
  <string id="6140579">Is there more you need, Champion?</string>
  <string id="6140583">Thank you for taking care of that business with the guard captain.</string>
  <string id="6140584">I don't know how we would have stopped Huon and Evelina without you.</string>
  <string id="6140585">I heard rumors you destroyed a demon who possessed the Dalish queen. Perhaps they will be less free with magic now.</string>
  <string id="6140586">I fear Ser Alrik's plan may seem a mercy compared to what is to come.</string>
  <string id="6140587">I hope the Order can count on your support, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6140593">The knight-commander agreed to show mercy to those found conspiring with Ser Thrask.</string>
  <string id="6140596">The knight-commander has dealt with the members of the plot you uncovered.</string>
  <string id="6140599">Champion. I'm sure you know how much it meant to the knight-commander for you to take her side against Orsino.</string>
  <string id="6140602">Champion. It seems you've become less a friend to the templars in the years since your ascent.</string>
  <string id="6140605">But surely you're the only mage in Kirkwall who can approach the knight-commander directly if you wished.</string>
  <string id="6140608">But surely you can see the knight-commander directly now, should you wish.</string>
  <string id="6140611">What would you have of me?</string>
  <string id="6140612">Just catching up.</string>
  <string id="6140613">Everyone says the knight-commander's gone crazy. Are you still behind her?</string>
  <string id="6140614">Do you still support Meredith?</string>
  <string id="6140615">The people ask too much of her. She needs a spine of iron to survive her position. </string>
  <string id="6140618">I have seen madness before. I saw Uldred's eyes when there was nothing human left in them.</string>
  <string id="6140621">The knight-commander... she is not there yet. But I do not have to ask where the rumors come from.</string>
  <string id="6140622">If it comes to war with the mages, whose side do you think the grand cleric will take?</string>
  <string id="6140623">Will Elthina take sides?</string>
  <string id="6140624">She is bound by faith and duty to support the templars.</string>
  <string id="6140627">We have dominance over mages by divine right.</string>
  <string id="6140630">But it is cruel how she leads them on, letting them think they might have a chance at rebellion.</string>
  <string id="6140631">What is the knight-commander doing about the conspirators?</string>
  <string id="6140632">What happened to Thrask's men?</string>
  <string id="6140633">The mages have been confined to their quarters and sedated. The templars have been suspended without pay.</string>
  <string id="6140636">That is as lenient as we dare be.</string>
  <string id="6140637">Did you not see them as you came in? The knight-commander will ensure no one follows their example.</string>
  <string id="6140638">I believe one of my associates is plotting against the Chantry.</string>
  <string id="6140639">I have a warning about Anders.</string>
  <string id="6140640">What are you doing?</string>
  <string id="6140643">I suppose I need not ask which of the known apostates you're talking about.</string>
  <string id="6140646">I will pass on your warning.</string>
  <string id="6140647">I have already warned both the knight-commander and Elthina about the rebel Anders.</string>
  <string id="6140650">We sent a force to apprehend him in Darktown, but the location we were given had been abandoned.</string>
  <string id="6140651">We will be sending a force to apprehend him in Darktown soon.</string>
  <string id="6140652">I just wanted to see how an old friend is doing in this difficult time.</string>
  <string id="6140653">It was nice catching up.</string>
  <string id="6140654">After what happened in Ferelden, I told myself I would never again question the purpose of the Order.</string>
  <string id="6140657">But it grows harder each day to tell whether I am serving the templars or only the knight-commander.</string>
  <string id="6140660">It may be that they are no longer one and the same.</string>
  <string id="6140661">Sorry to bother you.</string>
  <string id="6140662">I'm leaving now.</string>
  <string id="6140663">It's never a problem, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6140693">Wallop Mallet</string>
  <string id="6140694">I've got a stiff drink with your name on it!</string>
  <string id="6140715">Gamlen,&#13;
&#13;
I found the Gem of Keroshek. If you want it, come to Darktown. Alone.&#13;
&#13;
</string>
  <string id="6140728">There was a war, long ago. Between my people and the Tevinter Imperium.</string>
  <string id="6140740">Gamlen,&#13;
&#13;
This gem is very pretty, I can understand your obsession with it. Remember the game, wallop? Find the place your wallop mallet came from. Your answers are there.</string>
  <string id="6140743">After the magisters sunk Arlathan, my people made a last stand here, fighting on the graves of our elders.</string>
  <string id="6140745">A note is scrawled on the back of the bill.&#13;
&#13;
Bill of Lading &#13;
Smetty's Fish Guttery&#13;
Crate 1023&#13;
&#13;
Gamlen,&#13;
&#13;
I'm sure you're losing patience by now, but what is one small trip to the warehouse district after waiting twenty years to get your hands on this gem? Find the crate noted on this bill. Enjoy your search!</string>
  <string id="6140746">Bill of Lading</string>
  <string id="6140758">I don't know if it was the Elvhenan or Tevinter who bound the spirit, but he was left here from the war.</string>
  <string id="6140777">Are you ready, Carver?</string>
  <string id="6140780">I don't see the point. I'm better than most at...</string>
  <string id="6140783">Yells</string>
  <string id="6140786">Better isn't enough or heroes would never die.</string>
  <string id="6140789">I wasn't ready. That's all. Cheap trick.</string>
  <string id="6140795">All right, Bethany. Your turn.</string>
  <string id="6140798">Ready. I think. You did say we had started?</string>
  <string id="6140801">Grunts</string>
  <string id="6140804">I'm impressed. You've practiced.</string>
  <string id="6140807">My sister taught me much.</string>
  <string id="6140810">My brothers taught me much.</string>
  <string id="6140816">Do you ever feel like the world's getting... simpler? Like everything from eating to fighting is a lot less complex than it used to be?</string>
  <string id="6140842">Karasaad</string>
  <string id="6140846">Karasaad</string>
  <string id="6140859">I can't believe they use the wood from a vhenadahl tree to make this wallop mallet. It's just a child's toy!</string>
  <string id="6140860">Well, we found the tree the wallop mallet's made from. Now what?</string>
  <string id="6140861">So this is the tree Gamlen's wallop mallet comes from?</string>
  <string id="6140862">And this is the tree your uncle's wallop mallet was made from? </string>
  <string id="6140863">So the wallop mallet came from this kind of tree?</string>
  <string id="6140864">So, we're here. What did this have to do with the wallop mallet again?</string>
  <string id="6140865">So Gamlen's wallop mallet was made from this kind of tree.</string>
  <string id="6140903">Bring Gamlen to the caverns where we first met. If he's not alive, you won't get a single copper.</string>
  <string id="6140904">Capture Gamlen</string>
  <string id="6140905">A glass for those we've lost.</string>
  <string id="6140906">A toast for the deceased.</string>
  <string id="6140907">Laughs All right then. </string>
  <string id="6140910">Don't let anyone tell you when to move on. Take their hand and say my choice.</string>
  <string id="6140914">Someone killed a dozen of our best men... in the chantry itself! Are the people here animals?</string>
  <string id="6140917">Ahem..</string>
  <string id="6140918">Now we must seek out new recruits.</string>
  <string id="6140919">We have a Seeker in town. She has not said what she hopes to uncover.</string>
  <string id="6140923">Ser Thrask said you tried to assist him with the Starkhaven apostates. I'm sorry they didn't make it.</string>
  <string id="6140924">Ser Karras commends you for your aid in apprehending those apostates.</string>
  <string id="6140927">Perhaps they will find peace now.</string>
  <string id="6140928">Thank you for sending the boy Feynriel to the Circle. He was near to madness.</string>
  <string id="6140932">I've been hearing interesting things about your sister, Hawke. I hope they're not true.</string>
  <string id="6140933">I've been hearing disturbing rumors about you, Hawke. I hope they're not true.</string>
  <string id="6140937">I have told the knight-commander of your service.</string>
  <string id="6140940">She commends your quick thinking and has agreed to keep the lad Keran around for observation.</string>
  <string id="6140941">She commends your understanding of the threat Keran posed.</string>
  <string id="6140942">I've heard a lot about the knight-commander. What's she really like?</string>
  <string id="6140943">Tell me about Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6140944">She is not an easy taskmaster. But it is not an easy task.</string>
  <string id="6140947">I would not have liked her when I was younger. I thought mages deserved a softer touch.</string>
  <string id="6140950">But Meredith is never fooled by a sweet face. She always sees the demon behind it.</string>
  <string id="6140951">What's it like being in the Order? Do you feel you're accomplishing anything?</string>
  <string id="6140952">Do you like being a templar?</string>
  <string id="6140953">The templars are not a good choice for anyone who requires a strong sense of achievement.</string>
  <string id="6140956">It is a losing battle. Every day new mages are born in Thedas. Every day, those born a dozen years ago come into their power.</string>
  <string id="6140959">The best we can do is to contain the threat... and recruit more to fill our own ranks when they're emptied.</string>
  <string id="6140960">You sound Fereldan. How did you end up here?</string>
  <string id="6140961">Tell me about yourself.</string>
  <string id="6140962">I was in the Circle tower in Ferelden when Uldred summoned his demons.</string>
  <string id="6140965">I was held in a cage for... I can't even say. Weeks? Months? It was one unending nightmare.</string>
  <string id="6140968">I watched... what those mages did, what they became. I would gladly give my life to avoid seeing that again.</string>
  <string id="6140970">I support the templars.</string>
  <string id="6140971">The templars provide a necessary service.</string>
  <string id="6140974">Well, once someone admits to consorting with demons, it's a little easier to take sides.</string>
  <string id="6140977">What's that supposed to mean?</string>
  <string id="6140980">The templars defend us all.</string>
  <string id="6140983">That's a surprisingly unpopular viewpoint.</string>
  <string id="6140986">You have to admit, the templars have brought some of this hatred on themselves.</string>
  <string id="6140987">The Order needs to change.</string>
  <string id="6140988">That is the popular school of thought, no?</string>
  <string id="6140991">It used to be that templars were welcomed wherever they went—for defending people from dark magics.</string>
  <string id="6140994">Now the townsfolk are as likely to slam their doors as offer us a bed.</string>
  <string id="6140997">The image of the poor, chained apprentice is a powerful one. And one the mages are more than willing to exploit.</string>
  <string id="6141003">Knight-Captain Cullen</string>
  <string id="6141056">Maker's blessing, child. I am Elthina, grand cleric of Kirkwall. And I believe you're new to our city.</string>
  <string id="6141082">On her, lads.</string>
  <string id="6141083">Vhenadahl</string>
  <string id="6141085">Mythal, all-mother, protector of the People, watch over us, for the path we tread is perilous.</string>
  <string id="6141090">Benoit du Lac. And Leandra Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6141097">He wasn't like this in Lothering. I think he misses the open fields.</string>
  <string id="6141098">He just needs to get out more. Don't you, boy?</string>
  <string id="6141101">Happy bark!</string>
  <string id="6141102">We might soon have need for a war dog.</string>
  <string id="6141103">He might be useful.</string>
  <string id="6141104">Take it! I'm sick of what's-his-name staring and panting.</string>
  <string id="6141109">Save us from the darkness, as you did before, and we will sing your name to the heavens.</string>
  <string id="6141112">Sorry. I didn't mean to hold us. You just— It's never wise to ignore Mythal.</string>
  <string id="6141113">City Guardsman</string>
  <string id="6141127">Revin is a good boy. Please, give me the strength to find him.</string>
  <string id="6141128">Who or what is Mythal?</string>
  <string id="6141129">Mythal?</string>
  <string id="6141132">Prayer isn't going to help anything.</string>
  <string id="6141133">We're wasting time.</string>
  <string id="6141134">There's no need to worry. Nothing will happen.</string>
  <string id="6141135">Everything will be fine.</string>
  <string id="6141136">If she's temperamental, maybe I should join you.</string>
  <string id="6141137">Should I pray, too?</string>
  <string id="6141138">He's part of the family. I wouldn't want to lose him.</string>
  <string id="6141139">I worry for his safety.</string>
  <string id="6141140">But if he's with us, who'd keep Gamlen's debt collectors away?</string>
  <string id="6141141">Gamlen might miss him.</string>
  <string id="6141142">Gamlen, honestly! A mabari understands what you say. Try using his name.</string>
  <string id="6141145">What's wrong with dog? Real easy to remember...</string>
  <string id="6141155">How was I to know she was... a lady of ill repute? Those eyes... Oh, Maker. And those legs!</string>
  <string id="6141156">Please Maker, take away this burning itch. If you do this for me, I'll never step foot in that brothel again. I swear!</string>
  <string id="6141168">Petrice</string>
  <string id="6141176">She's the protector, the mother of the Creators. The one who put the moon in the sky. Wisest of all the gods.</string>
  <string id="6141183">There's been no change. None. More Qunari dead for no reason other than hate.</string>
  <string id="6141187">More Qunari dead, and why? Blind hate. It's ugly. These zealots will drive their own faithful away.</string>
  <string id="6141194">I heard about Lowtown. I can't believe the Qunari had anything to do with it.</string>
  <string id="6141198">More lies about the Qunari. Why would they poison a street? There's no sense to it.</string>
  <string id="6141202">I hope you can help my father, Serah Hawke. The Qunari don't need to be his enemy.</string>
  <string id="6141206">Go on. There's an imaginary menace out there to blame our problems on.</string>
  <string id="6141207">No, it's not that. Even though she may not be listening, you mustn't provoke her!</string>
  <string id="6141208">I hope not, but the People never neglect Mythal's shrines. She— it's dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6141209">It wouldn't hurt.</string>
  <string id="6141231">I was in the chantry the other night, and there was a giant cheese wheel on the altar, where the eternal flame should have been.</string>
  <string id="6141234">There's something to it, I swear. It's a sign from Blessed Andraste.</string>
  <string id="6141237">When Elgar'nan defeated his father, the sun, the earth was plunged into darkness. Everything was about to perish.</string>
  <string id="6141240">Mythal appeared then, calmed Elgar'nan, and restored the sun to the heavens. The people always look to her for help.</string>
  <string id="6141247">They say if Mythal smiles on you, then you need fear nothing at all.</string>
  <string id="6141264">Female Warrior - LOCKED</string>
  <string id="6141265">Powerful fighters focused on melee weapons. They can withstand and deliver a great deal of punishment.</string>
  <string id="6141278">When was the last time you were with a woman?</string>
  <string id="6141281">Never! Women are harlots who seek to steal my life essence!</string>
  <string id="6141284">Seems like a lot of work for little gain.</string>
  <string id="6141402">A Package from Gascard DuPuis</string>
  <string id="6141413">Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
I'm probably the last person you wish to hear from. I played a regrettable part in your mother's death, and I will live with that the rest of my life. You could have killed me, but showed me mercy. I have decided to use this second chance to change my ways. I am giving up magic.&#13;
&#13;
I found this magical artifact in my stash. Perhaps you will find some use for it.&#13;
&#13;
Gascard DuPuis</string>
  <string id="6141441">Did I hear correctly? You are an... abomination?</string>
  <string id="6141444">Why don't you shout? I don't think everyone heard you.</string>
  <string id="6141447">Do you see yourself as harmless, then? An abomination who would never harm anyone?</string>
  <string id="6141450">Like ripping someone's heart out of his chest?</string>
  <string id="6141453">I did that at the behest of no demon.</string>
  <string id="6141456">So we agree that it doesn't take a demon for someone to be a vicious killer? Good.</string>
  <string id="6141491">Why was your friend made Tranquil? Do you know?</string>
  <string id="6141494">No, and it doesn't matter. Nobody deserves that.</string>
  <string id="6141497">I know some mages who deserve that.</string>
  <string id="6141500">Really? Perhaps they should start making slaves Tranquil—then they wouldn't dream of escaping! Wouldn't that be wonderful?</string>
  <string id="6141503">Slaves do not attract demons that try to possess them.</string>
  <string id="6141506">Which clearly justifies it? What a perfect solution!</string>
  <string id="6141511">You should have lived in Tevinter. You'd be happier there.</string>
  <string id="6141514">You're probably right.</string>
  <string id="6141517">There, your magic would be a mark of honor. Apprenticed to the right magister, you would do well.</string>
  <string id="6141520">Is there a down side?</string>
  <string id="6141523">Only if you're bothered by owning a few slaves and performing the occasional blood ritual.</string>
  <string id="6141526">So they all do those things?</string>
  <string id="6141529">Just the ones who don't complain about how powerless and persecuted they are.</string>
  <string id="6141549">I seem to recall you saying something a while ago...</string>
  <string id="6141552">Shut up.</string>
  <string id="6141555">I can control it. Wasn't that what you said?</string>
  <string id="6141558">So help me...</string>
  <string id="6141563">By now, you must see what an injustice the templars are.</string>
  <string id="6141566">Must I? I see templars trying to control what they have good reason to fear.</string>
  <string id="6141569">But they go too far.</string>
  <string id="6141572">Talk to Hawke about his mother. Ask him who went too far.</string>
  <string id="6141575">Talk to Hawke about her mother. Ask her who went too far.</string>
  <string id="6141578">You can't hold all mages responsible for that!</string>
  <string id="6141581">It doesn't take all mages to cause this. Only the weak ones.</string>
  <string id="6141586">Not all mages are weak.</string>
  <string id="6141589">True. Hawke, for instance, is not weak.</string>
  <string id="6141592">true. Bethany, for instance, was not weak.</string>
  <string id="6141595">You specifically don't mention me.</string>
  <string id="6141598">That's also true.</string>
  <string id="6141601">I'll prove to you that I'm not weak.</string>
  <string id="6141604">Prove it to yourself. You're convincing no one else.</string>
  <string id="6141613">You are... living with Hawke, now?</string>
  <string id="6141616">What's it to you?</string>
  <string id="6141619">Be good to him. Break his heart, and I will kill you.</string>
  <string id="6141622">Be good to her. Break her heart, and I will kill you.</string>
  <string id="6141645">I understand you're named after a famous knight?</string>
  <string id="6141648">Everyone always brings up the name.</string>
  <string id="6141651">I've not heard of Ser Aveline—is she very famous?</string>
  <string id="6141654">Really? They don't tell of her glorious downfall in Tevinter?</string>
  <string id="6141657">Not to slaves.</string>
  <string id="6141660">Pardon me for saying so, but thank the Maker for that.</string>
  <string id="6141665">You do not like your name?</string>
  <string id="6141668">My name is a wish my father made. And I did want to be a knight, but...</string>
  <string id="6141671">I see. Still, it's a good name. A strong name.</string>
  <string id="6141674">What were you named after?</string>
  <string id="6141677">I don't know my real name. My master called me Fenris, his little wolf.</string>
  <string id="6141680">Could you not call yourself something different now?</string>
  <string id="6141683">Couldn't you?</string>
  <string id="6141686">A fine point.</string>
  <string id="6141691">It feels good to be captain of the guard, yes?</string>
  <string id="6141694">No, I will not change the patrols around your mansion again. There's already been too many questions.</string>
  <string id="6141697">You wound my pride with such accusations.</string>
  <string id="6141700">But you were going to ask.</string>
  <string id="6141703">Eventually.</string>
  <string id="6141706">Laughs I'll look at the roster and see what I can do.</string>
  <string id="6141711">I was speaking to Donnic the other day...</string>
  <string id="6141714">Since when do you talk with my husband?</string>
  <string id="6141717">He... comes to the mansion once a week? We play diamondback.</string>
  <string id="6141720">What? Why am I not invited to these games?</string>
  <string id="6141723">He says you get angry when you lose.</string>
  <string id="6141726">I do not! All right, perhaps I do. Still, that's no reason not to tell me.</string>
  <string id="6141729">Perhaps he longed for less masculine companionship?</string>
  <string id="6141732">Shut up, whore.</string>
  <string id="6141735">It is if he's a betting man.</string>
  <string id="6141738">I disavow all knowledge of gambling occurring in my household.</string>
  <string id="6141741">He's a good man, Aveline. I enjoy his visits.</string>
  <string id="6141744">Fine, fine. Have your man time, then.</string>
  <string id="6141749">Thank you for that tip, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6141752">You caught them, then?</string>
  <string id="6141755">Yes—a whole nest of slave runners working out of the Undercity.</string>
  <string id="6141758">I imagine you imprisoned them?</string>
  <string id="6141761">Sadly, they never made it to prison.</string>
  <string id="6141764">You always know how to make me smile, Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6141769">You've been an apostate your whole life, then?</string>
  <string id="6141772">Like my father before me. What of it?</string>
  <string id="6141775">Didn't your family consider that dangerous?</string>
  <string id="6141778">There are mages who go their whole lives without ever falling prey to a demon. Many of them, in fact.</string>
  <string id="6141781">And if the templars came looking for you? That would not be danger enough?</string>
  <string id="6141784">Perhaps there shouldn't be any templars.</string>
  <string id="6141789">You know, you cannot wish the templars away.</string>
  <string id="6141792">I can try.</string>
  <string id="6141795">Is the Circle here truly so terrible an option?</string>
  <string id="6141798">Do you really have to ask that?</string>
  <string id="6141801">You would be kept safe from others as well as from yourself, and they would be kept safe from you.</string>
  <string id="6141804">I... didn't ask for this.</string>
  <string id="6141807">Nobody asks for their fate.</string>
  <string id="6141812">So... this master of yours wants your markings back? Skin and all?</string>
  <string id="6141815">So his hunters told me. Unwillingly.</string>
  <string id="6141818">So why not cover them up? Wouldn't that make you harder to find?</string>
  <string id="6141821">Let them come. I am not one to hide.</string>
  <string id="6141824">Still, if it were me—</string>
  <string id="6141827">It's not.</string>
  <string id="6141832">So you've really never thought of hiding from those hunters?</string>
  <string id="6141835">To what end?</string>
  <string id="6141838">So you could, I don't know, have a life?</string>
  <string id="6141841">What life do you have? There are no hunters after you at all.</string>
  <string id="6141844">I have a life!</string>
  <string id="6141847">One that you complain about. We are not always free to do as we wish, as you should well know.</string>
  <string id="6141850">I do have a life.</string>
  <string id="6141853">Then I stand corrected.</string>
  <string id="6141858">I enjoy a man with markings like that.</string>
  <string id="6141861">You've enjoyed many, I suspect.</string>
  <string id="6141864">Where I come from, they're called tattoos. Sailors get them all the time.</string>
  <string id="6141867">Not made of lyrium, I'd imagine.</string>
  <string id="6141870">Not a one. And the pictures are different—usually breasts.</string>
  <string id="6141873">I suppose a pair of lyrium breasts tattooed onto my chest would make things better.</string>
  <string id="6141876">That's me. I'm a helper.</string>
  <string id="6141881">So this relic you mentioned losing...</string>
  <string id="6141884">You have pretty eyes.</string>
  <string id="6141887">I... have pretty eyes.</string>
  <string id="6141890">You elves have such pretty eyes, even the men. It makes me want to pluck them out and wear them as a necklace.</string>
  <string id="6141893">I wouldn't suggest trying.</string>
  <string id="6141896">Oh, I would never try. Not without reason, of course.</string>
  <string id="6141899">Forget I said anything.</string>
  <string id="6141904">You keep staring at me. Is it my eyes again?</string>
  <string id="6141907">You're very lanky, for an elf. I like lanky.</string>
  <string id="6141910">From what I gather, you like a lot of things.</string>
  <string id="6141913">Nonsense. But when I see something I like, I go after it.</string>
  <string id="6141916">I suggest keeping your distance.</string>
  <string id="6141919">Now you're just making it challenging.</string>
  <string id="6141922">Do you intend to go after me, then?</string>
  <string id="6141925">Will you take off all that spiky armor you're wearing?</string>
  <string id="6141928">It's been known to happen.</string>
  <string id="6141931">Then forget it.</string>
  <string id="6141936">So you engaged a Qunari dreadnought in battle?</string>
  <string id="6141939">They engaged me in battle. I was just trying to get away.</string>
  <string id="6141942">Sailing into the storm was a gamble. Took care of the dreadnought, but it did us in too. Can't win them all.</string>
  <string id="6141945">Where I come from, we would call that insanity.</string>
  <string id="6141948">Nothing ventured, nothing gained.</string>
  <string id="6142009">Kirkwall's a dangerous place for our friends. But you've made their lot easier.</string>
  <string id="6142012">Several of them put their coin together to get you this.</string>
  <string id="6142015">Many thanks, messere. Your payment.</string>
  <string id="6142017">A lot of good, desperate folk owe you their lives, love. You've earned this.</string>
  <string id="6142021">If you help our friends, come back so I can reward you proper-like.</string>
  <string id="6142025">What do you need, love? Package delivery?</string>
  <string id="6142028">I'm Hawke. I got a letter from some mage friends.</string>
  <string id="6142031">I see, I see. Check the back of the board for our special rates.</string>
  <string id="6142032">Helping apostates is dangerous. If the templars caught you...</string>
  <string id="6142033">Why are you aiding mages?</string>
  <string id="6142034">One of my sisters is a mage. A gentle child, so generous.</string>
  <string id="6142037">She was made Tranquil last year. Templars claimed she was a danger.</string>
  <string id="6142040">Now... it's like she's not there. That shouldn't be forced on anyone.</string>
  <string id="6142041">I won't stand by while mages suffer.</string>
  <string id="6142042">How can I help?</string>
  <string id="6142043">Bless you, love.</string>
  <string id="6142046">Oh, cloak and dagger phrases! How about, The queasy crow flies at midnight?</string>
  <string id="6142047">You use secret code?</string>
  <string id="6142048">How about, The smart-mouthed Fereldan gets slapped across the face? </string>
  <string id="6142051">The board has all the details. Should you take care of something, just drop by.</string>
  <string id="6142052">I don't have time for word games. What do the mages need?</string>
  <string id="6142053">Be straight with me.</string>
  <string id="6142054">No need to get huffy. Lots of things need doing to help the mages.</string>
  <string id="6142057">It's all on the board, love. You take care of one of the jobs, just let me know.</string>
  <string id="6142063">Big or small, transport of all kinds. Kirkwall's best prices!</string>
  <string id="6142064">Val Royeaux! Rivain! You name it, we deliver! Best rates in Kirkwall!</string>
  <string id="6142065">Caravan heading for Markham! Markham! One wagon has room—rates negotiable!</string>
  <string id="6142067">You have gone too far, Meredith! This is not what the templars are!</string>
  <string id="6142068">Never put much stock in that saying, till now.</string>
  <string id="6142076">A Note for Gamlen</string>
  <string id="6142081">Mercenary Commander</string>
  <string id="6142083">Summoning a demon can't possibly be the only way to fix the mirror. Someone else must know something.</string>
  <string id="6142084">There must be a better way.</string>
  <string id="6142085">What do you mean it doesn't work?</string>
  <string id="6142086">What's wrong with the mirror?</string>
  <string id="6142092">Did you notice Sister Alema miss two lines in her last sermon? I think her age is catching up with her.</string>
  <string id="6142093">He said he witnessed its forging. He told me how to cleanse it of its corruption.</string>
  <string id="6142094">The eluvian was lost before Arlathan fell. The only creatures who would know anything about it are in the Fade.</string>
  <string id="6142100">Go to Darktown to confront the person asking after Gamlen.</string>
  <string id="6142101">Well... look at it! Do you think it's supposed to just sit there and show nothing at all?</string>
  <string id="6142104">I can feel the power in it, but it's... like it's asleep. I can't seem to wake it.</string>
  <string id="6142107">He must know how to make it work.</string>
  <string id="6142110">Yes, I've noticed. The poor dear walked out of her chambers with her robes on inside out the other day.</string>
  <string id="6142113">Well, we can't have her forgetting her lines like that. People will talk!</string>
  <string id="6142115">Talk some sense into Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6142116">Your First is going to summon a demon to get advice about her mirror.</string>
  <string id="6142117">Merrill feels that her only option to finish the mirror is to summon a demon. </string>
  <string id="6142118">Could you possibly convince Merrill that summoning a demon is not going to help anything?</string>
  <string id="6142120">Help us fix the mirror.</string>
  <string id="6142121">How can Merrill fix the eluvian?</string>
  <string id="6142122">Merrill needs to know how to make her mirror work, and it's better she asks you than a demon.</string>
  <string id="6142123">We thought we'd ask for your opinion on ancient magic mirrors.</string>
  <string id="6142133">You know, I heard Sister Alema has been dipping into the spirits again.</string>
  <string id="6142136">Have you noticed the smell coming off her lately? It's like she's been swimming in hard liquor!</string>
  <string id="6142139">Let's just hope she doesn't get too close to the candles! Laughs</string>
  <string id="6142146">Did you really have to say it that way?</string>
  <string id="6142149">She's not going to help. I told you.</string>
  <string id="6142152">I'm standing right here, you know.</string>
  <string id="6142155">The clan still has business here, da'len. We will leave when it is time.</string>
  <string id="6142158">It was time three years ago! You can't stay here! Eventually, the humans will force you to leave.</string>
  <string id="6142161">There are plenty of hiding places in these mountains. We will stay until my business is done.</string>
  <string id="6142166">Is there anything you can do once a Dalish is taken over by a demon?</string>
  <string id="6142167">Can you help possessed elves?</string>
  <string id="6142168">This gem has caused me nothing but grief—like it's cursed.</string>
  <string id="6142171">Trinketsmonger</string>
  <string id="6142173">If one of the Dalish becomes an abomination, what do you do?</string>
  <string id="6142174">Can you save possessed elves?</string>
  <string id="6142178">It would be most appreciated if you didn't come clomping through here like a herd of cattle.</string>
  <string id="6142182">What are you looking at? Are you one of them?</string>
  <string id="6142194">Weaponsmith</string>
  <string id="6142196">You came up with that coin a little too easily, Hawke. Makes me wonder just how much more you have.</string>
  <string id="6142197">I dare you to try taking it, dwarf.</string>
  <string id="6142198">Come find out.</string>
  <string id="6142199">I already gave you what you asked for. Why do this now?</string>
  <string id="6142200">I paid you.</string>
  <string id="6142201">I already broke one deal. This can't be such a surprise, can it?</string>
  <string id="6142202">I let you walk away— are you really this stupid?</string>
  <string id="6142203">You can't be serious.</string>
  <string id="6142204">We'll see, won't we?</string>
  <string id="6142205">You did, but look around you. You've prospered nicely.</string>
  <string id="6142208">Is it fair that I only doubled my money while you got all of this? I don't think so.</string>
  <string id="6142211">There's no evidence. There couldn't be.</string>
  <string id="6142212">You're bluffing.</string>
  <string id="6142213">Does it have to be real? I think it just has to raise enough questions.</string>
  <string id="6142216">How badly do you want the eyes of the templars upon you? Not very, I'll wager.</string>
  <string id="6142217">How much do you want your new friend, the viscount, to know about your past? Not much, I'll wager.</string>
  <string id="6142220">We'd better not.</string>
  <string id="6142251">I thank you for Donnic, but what else is here for me? More doubt from you.</string>
  <string id="6142256">The amount of noise you're making is ridiculous!</string>
  <string id="6142260">Dear me. Are you here to make a donation? We can always use the help.</string>
  <string id="6142278">Slow day.</string>
  <string id="6142281">Sniffs You been drinking?</string>
  <string id="6142284">No. Maybe? Yes?</string>
  <string id="6142287">Face it. You don't pay me enough to stay sober at work.</string>
  <string id="6142296">If you are hoping the Dalish hold miracles, child, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.</string>
  <string id="6142300">You are Hawke. A patrol went missing along the Wounded Coast.</string>
  <string id="6142303">You have fought Qunari before and triumphed. Arvaarad, no less.</string>
  <string id="6142306">The Arishok says you have some semblance of honor.</string>
  <string id="6142309">So tell me, did you kill them?</string>
  <string id="6142310">If I did kill them, why would I tell you? You'd just attack me.</string>
  <string id="6142311">And if I confessed?</string>
  <string id="6142312">I seek an answer to a question, What has happened to the missing karataam?</string>
  <string id="6142315">Vengeance is not relevant to this task.</string>
  <string id="6142316">I don't know what you're talking about.</string>
  <string id="6142317">I'm innocent.</string>
  <string id="6142318">I can't be your only suspect. There's Coterie, Carta, templars—take your pick.</string>
  <string id="6142319">I'm at the top of your list?</string>
  <string id="6142320">You think the bas in this city could fell a karataam? Hardly. You are another matter.</string>
  <string id="6142323">I haven't killed any Qunari recently. Mind your tone or that could change.</string>
  <string id="6142324">Watch who you accuse.</string>
  <string id="6142325">I believe you.</string>
  <string id="6142328">If you are not responsible, I waste my time here.</string>
  <string id="6142331">I'm afraid we Dalish do not have any better solution than the Circle of Magi, child.</string>
  <string id="6142366">You started something, helping me as you did.</string>
  <string id="6142367">Not that I appreciated it at first, but things change.</string>
  <string id="6142368">Even by not taking sides, you helped start something.</string>
  <string id="6142376">Even if the demon is driven out, the soul is left scarred. It can never recover. Not truly.</string>
  <string id="6142377">A soul taken over is permanently damaged. Drive out one demon, and another will soon take its place.</string>
  <string id="6142378">What's the word on the street?</string>
  <string id="6142379">Any news?</string>
  <string id="6142380">Just passing through your fine establishment.</string>
  <string id="6142381">Just saying hello.</string>
  <string id="6142382">Chuckles You haven't seen our little patrons yet.</string>
  <string id="6142389">I found your patrol. They won't be coming back.</string>
  <string id="6142392">You have stolen my duty, basra.</string>
  <string id="6142395">We were supplied for this task. But you have done this, instead. Take what was meant for us.</string>
  <string id="6142398">Don't do it again.</string>
  <string id="6142410">Like a wounded animal, it will fall prey to scavengers. The only cure is death.</string>
  <string id="6142413">The Dalish hunt and kill our abominations, just as the humans do. We have no choice.</string>
  <string id="6142414">It's possible I may need somewhere else to go. In the near future. Would...here be an option?</string>
  <string id="6142415">You're always welcome here.</string>
  <string id="6142416">Way to kill the romance.</string>
  <string id="6142419">Are you asking to move in?</string>
  <string id="6142427">Tailor</string>
  <string id="6142435">I hear rumors of a healer in Darktown who's looking after the sick. For free. Imagine that.</string>
  <string id="6142436">You saw the shipwrecked Qunari? There was a man in here who swears he saw the whole thing happen.</string>
  <string id="6142439">Apparently, the dreadnought was fighting another ship before they both crashed on the reef.</string>
  <string id="6142441">Armor Merchant</string>
  <string id="6142449">I heard the Hero of Ferelden married Queen Anora, but is keeping an elven lover. Scandalous.</string>
  <string id="6142450">You hear about King Alistair of Ferelden? He has an elven mistress. Hope his queen never finds out.</string>
  <string id="6142451">After the Blight was defeated in Ferelden, the Circle of Magi was given its autonomy. That'll be a disaster.</string>
  <string id="6142452">You hear about the arl of Redcliffe? Some say Andraste herself reached down and cured him so he could unite the land.</string>
  <string id="6142455">Not when some of their ideas are so... compelling.</string>
  <string id="6142456">It is part of our world! It has been in our world for centuries!</string>
  <string id="6142459">Armor Stand</string>
  <string id="6142464">Armorer</string>
  <string id="6142467">Tailor</string>

  <string id="6142470">Armor</string>
  <string id="6142471">Weapons</string>
  <string id="6142475">People say Meredith's the real power in Kirkwall, not the viscount. Even Dumar answers to her.</string>
  <string id="6142476">You ever met Viscount Dumar? The man doesn't use his head for anything but storage for fancy hats.</string>
  <string id="6142477">Apparently, the Qunari are just waiting for a ship to take them back to Par Vollen. Hope it comes soon.</string>
  <string id="6142482">Trinkets Emporium</string>
  <string id="6142483">Armor Merchant</string>
  <string id="6142484">Weaponsmithy</string>
  <string id="6142487">No one is pained more by Mahariel's loss than I, but the mirror wasn't responsible.</string>
  <string id="6142490">Tamlen's death was tragic, but it was not the mirror's doing!</string>
  <string id="6142493">But I'm wasting my time. You'd rather fear the past than reclaim it. This is pointless, Hawke. Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6142494">Is it dangerous?</string>
  <string id="6142495">What are the risks?</string>
  <string id="6142496">There are always dangers with magic. But I believe this will be worth the cost.</string>
  <string id="6142497">Ew. We can't just... buy it somewhere?</string>
  <string id="6142500">It's not used by mages here. There's no reason for any merchant to stock it.</string>
  <string id="6142503">We're not looking for virgins' blood or the tongue of a hanged man or anything, are we?</string>
  <string id="6142504">No eye of newt?</string>

  <string id="6142528">Tailor</string>
  <string id="6142536">We can enter the sewers from here to look for the sela petrae. Are you ready?</string>
  <string id="6142537">Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6142538">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6142539">Hold your nose. We'll have to get pretty close for me to tell what we're looking at.</string>
  <string id="6142542">Not yet.</string>
  <string id="6142543">No.</string>
  <string id="6142544">Just let me know.</string>
  <string id="6142547">Are you ready to go in?</string>
  <string id="6142552">Are you ready to go into the Bone Pit?</string>
  <string id="6142553">Ready as I'll ever be.</string>
  <string id="6142554">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6142555">We'll have to look for drakestone deposits along the sides.</string>
  <string id="6142558">I want to look around first.</string>
  <string id="6142559">No.</string>
  <string id="6142560">I'm with you.</string>

  <string id="6142631">What should we be prepared for if something goes wrong?</string>
  <string id="6142632">Does anybody else get the feeling that this is going to end badly? Just me, huh?</string>

  <string id="6142650">I do wish the viscount would have them run off.</string>
  <string id="6142657">Those children! The orphaned Fereldans ran off again after we fed them.</string>
  <string id="6142660">I wish they'd let us help them. It'd be better than scraping by on the streets of Darktown.</string>
  <string id="6142677">Deserter Reaver</string>
  <string id="6142703">There are other ways to see the world. The Qunari have shown me that.</string>
  <string id="6142711">I expect this to be no different.</string>
  <string id="6142714">But, by all means, tell me how you hate the beasts and all who stand with them. I've heard it all.</string>
  <string id="6142715">I've done nothing to you. Or for you, for that matter.</string>
  <string id="6142716">You judge too quickly.</string>

  <string id="6142745">Not even a tiny bit.</string>
  <string id="6142746">Another time. When things are better.</string>
  <string id="6142752">It's not all bad, Varric. Think of the stories you'll be able to tell later!</string>
  <string id="6142753">I'm not entirely sure. I've never seen an abomination, myself. The Keeper said they... warp and change before your eyes.</string>
  <string id="6142760">You have choices! You always had choices! Stop using blood magic! Get rid of that damned mirror!</string>
  <string id="6142763">In that case, I'll head back to Kirkwall and throw it away. Right after you abandon the plight of the Circle mages.</string>
  <string id="6142771">It's not too late to go back, you know.</string>
  <string id="6142785">No offense, Daisy, but I could live without telling anyone we murdered you on some mountainside.</string>
  <string id="6142788">It's a little hard to make that one sound good.</string>
  <string id="6142789">Saemus, wasn't it? The viscount's boy?</string>
  <string id="6142796">So go look for reasons to kill Qunari. Just don't expect me to praise you for it.</string>
  <string id="6142797">I'm the least of your worries if you stand with the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6142798">You're defending heretics.</string>
  <string id="6142803">It's going to take more to change people. Something big. Something... soon.</string>
  <string id="6142806">This can't... I just can't let this stand.</string>
  <string id="6142809">They face so much hate... has it come to the point where people must die?</string>
  <string id="6142812">And even if it's true... some days, I wouldn't blame them.</string>

  <string id="6142819">Qunari Delegate</string>
  <string id="6142823">Qunari Delegate</string>
  <string id="6142831">So you want us to come and watch for something, but you don't know what?</string>
  <string id="6142834">It's just a precaution, Aveline, nothing will go wrong.</string>
  <string id="6142837">Oh, that's reassuring.</string>
  <string id="6142845">Who thought putting a demon in a cave on Sundermount was a good idea in the first place?</string>
  <string id="6142846">How far is the cave, exactly?</string>
  <string id="6142847">How did you find this trapped demon?</string>
  <string id="6142848">Why do we have to go to a cave?</string>
  <string id="6142849">I've never heard of demons living in caves before. I thought they were all in the Fade.</string>
  <string id="6142850">It's a long way to the cave. So, I hope you enjoy the scenery.</string>
  <string id="6142865">Laughs Authority? My authority was lopped off and rolled across the floor courtesy of the Arishok!</string>
  <string id="6142892">Now I am trapped under templar scrutiny, waiting for them to note how easily I might be replaced.</string>
  <string id="6142895">It is not going well.</string>
  <string id="6142898">I have to finish this. I've sacrificed too much just to walk away.</string>
  <string id="6142901">Where would you have put him?</string>
  <string id="6142904">Tevinter, maybe. Or in the Anderfels. Further away from Kirkwall, that's for sure.</string>
  <string id="6142925">Anyone who thinks to take this office needs more than popular support. They need particular support.</string>
  <string id="6142928">Anyone who wants to rule Kirkwall needs support from the templars. That is the new truth of this city.</string>

  <string id="6142984">I am... not unsympathetic to your loss, Serah Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6142987">Well, you have certainly risen through the rank. Good for you.</string>
  <string id="6142991">The mage activity outside the Gallows will only increase templar scrutiny of this office.</string>
  <string id="6142992">I am receiving complaints—that is, one complaint repeatedly—that the Qunari are denying commerce in addition to the Maker.</string>
  <string id="6142993">The reports of blood mages concern me... but I shall continue to ignore them. I am resolute.</string>
  <string id="6142994">A templar Seeker in Kirkwall, and no official notification. Well, that is pleasant news.</string>
  <string id="6142995">I'm receiving reports of Qunari bodies. I would caution those responsible and suggest they not get all of us killed.</string>
  <string id="6142996">Mage activity seems to be on the rise. This office certainly needs that.</string>
  <string id="6142997">Rumor has it that considerable coin may or may not be set to change hands in Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6143001">So? You found an Archdemon yet?</string>
  <string id="6143004">No, I heard they're all underground... in the Deep Roads. Or something.</string>
  <string id="6143007">There's an expedition heading down there. You should go with them.</string>
  <string id="6143010">I think I might. After a drink.</string>
  <string id="6143013">You heard about that Hero of Ferelden?</string>
  <string id="6143016">Yes, why?</string>
  <string id="6143019">What makes a hero a hero, eh? I bet I could kill an Archdemon.</string>

  <string id="6143045">It's beyond the graveyard. Rather far, I'm afraid.</string>
  <string id="6143048">And you went up there alone last time? Despite undead and giant bug-like things roaming this place?</string>
  <string id="6143051">No. The first time the Keeper went with me, we both heard the spirit's call. She wanted to be sure the clan was safe.</string>
  <string id="6143054">It was the second time I came here alone.</string>
  <string id="6143057">He called out... from his prison. The Keeper and I heard him in our dreams.</string>
  <string id="6143060">A demon called to you, and you answered. Brilliant.</string>
  <string id="6143063">The spirit is trapped in there. He can't get back to the Fade.</string>
  <string id="6143066">And you don't suspect he might think you're a way out of his cave?</string>
  <string id="6143069">Of course I do! That's why you and Hawke are coming with me.</string>
  <string id="6143072">That's where he's supposed to be, but this spirit was trapped here long ago.</string>
  <string id="6143075">A trapped, cornered demon? Better and better.</string>
  <string id="6143078">Shut up, Merrill. You're making things worse.</string>
  <string id="6143085">Calls of conspiracy from the knight-commander, herself. There is no end to the complications of my position.</string>
  <string id="6143086">Mages abound in the shadows. How lovely for the person who is not myself who must deal with them.</string>
  <string id="6143087">A dangerous thing, taking sides. I avoid it wherever possible.</string>
  <string id="6143091">Kirkwall is—on the whole—grateful for your actions. Let us hope nothing more is necessary.</string>
  <string id="6143095">So what duties did you have? As a slave, I mean?</string>
  <string id="6143098">Not this again.</string>
  <string id="6143101">I heard that Tevinter slaves are kept oiled so they glisten. Did your master oil you up? Did you glisten for him?</string>
  <string id="6143104">I was his bodyguard.</string>
  <string id="6143107">Always close at hand. Always within reach. Glistening.</string>
  <string id="6143110">You have an entire story written in your head already, don't you?</string>
  <string id="6143113">Mmm.</string>
  <string id="6143116">I still can't believe Hawke saved you.</string>
  <string id="6143119">You've been saying that for years. Would you have turned me over to the Qunari?</string>
  <string id="6143122">No, but I know what they do to their prisoners.</string>
  <string id="6143125">Execute them horribly, I imagine.</string>
  <string id="6143128">The Qunari waste nothing. They would reeducate you into a loyal follower of the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6143131">Pfft. Could I refuse?</string>
  <string id="6143134">There's always qamek, which turns you into a mindless laborer. Like I said, they waste nothing.</string>
  <string id="6143137">Oh.</string>
  <string id="6143140">If you wish to thank Hawke, he's standing right there.</string>
  <string id="6143143">If you wish to thank Hawke, she's standing right there.</string>
  <string id="6143148">Why are you watching me like that?</string>
  <string id="6143151">You have vallaslin. The same markings that the Dalish have.</string>
  <string id="6143154">Yours are not made of lyrium.</string>
  <string id="6143157">No, they're made of blood. Our blood. That's what vallaslin means: blood writing. It's a mark of adulthood.</string>
  <string id="6143160">Mine were carved into my flesh against my will, in a ritual I remember only for the agony it caused me.</string>
  <string id="6143163">I'm... so sorry.</string>
  <string id="6143168">I don't want your pity.</string>
  <string id="6143171">Are you talking to me?</string>
  <string id="6143174">You said you were sorry about the ritual I endured. Keep your sorrow.</string>
  <string id="6143177">I only meant—</string>
  <string id="6143180">You have all the freedom none of our kind enjoy, and you throw it away. On what? </string>
  <string id="6143183">Our people need to reclaim their heritage.</string>
  <string id="6143186">A heritage of defeat? To what end?</string>
  <string id="6143189">Would you truly turn your back on your own history? There's so much we don't know...</string>
  <string id="6143192">It's not my history. It's simply history.</string>
  <string id="6143198">You never come to the alienage, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6143201">I don't live in the alienage.</string>
  <string id="6143204">Don't you care about the plight of our people? Not even a little bit?</string>
  <string id="6143207">I don't need to visit the alienage to know what they suffer. I know it better than you.</string>
  <string id="6143210">I've lived there for years! I see it firsthand!</string>
  <string id="6143213">And I lived it.</string>
  <string id="6143218">Avert your eyes, witch.</string>
  <string id="6143221">You said I was dwelling on useless history, but what are you doing?</string>
  <string id="6143224">The past is important, to you and to all of us. We must know it to move forward.</string>
  <string id="6143227">Yet I have made no deal with a demon to learn of my past.</string>
  <string id="6143230">You had a life. You had a family. And you abandoned them to chase after ghosts.</string>
  <string id="6143233">We are nothing alike. Don't even begin to think that we are.</string>
  <string id="6143238">You are more naive than I thought.</string>
  <string id="6143241">What have I done to you now?</string>
  <string id="6143244">To me? Nothing. Not yet.</string>
  <string id="6143247">To yourself—you can't even begin to imagine the number of mages that have walked down the path you're now on.</string>
  <string id="6143250">My clan didn't believe in me. If you don't believe in me either, I won't mind.</string>
  <string id="6143255">Your master must have been a terrible man, to make you hate mages so.</string>
  <string id="6143258">He is a terrible man. He's not dead.</string>
  <string id="6143261">He was. Now he's dead.</string>
  <string id="6143264">We're not all like him.</string>
  <string id="6143267">How often I hear that, and yet how often I find it's not true.</string>
  <string id="6143270">The Keepers are different. They exist to preserve the old ways, and to protect our people.</string>
  <string id="6143273">And none of them would ever fall prey to a demon. Or perform blood magic.</string>
  <string id="6143276">It's impossible to talk to you.</string>
  <string id="6143281">This... Keeper of yours. She was a friend?</string>
  <string id="6143284">She was like a mother to me. To all of us.</string>
  <string id="6143287">Then I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6143290">No you're not. She's just one more mage to you. Why would you be sorry she's dead?</string>
  <string id="6143293">I'm not sorry she's dead. I'm only sorry she died for you.</string>
  <string id="6143296">What?</string>
  <string id="6143299">Let's hope the sacrifice of someone who cared for you that much isn't wasted.</string>
  <string id="6143304">I thought all dwarves had beards. Where's yours?</string>
  <string id="6143307">I misplaced it, along with my sense of dwarven pride and my gold-plated noble caste pin.</string>
  <string id="6143310">I thought maybe it fell onto your chest.</string>
  <string id="6143313">Oh-ho! The broody elf tells a joke!</string>
  <string id="6143316">I don't brood.</string>
  <string id="6143319">Friend, if your brooding were any more impressive, women would swoon as you passed. They'd have broody babies in your honor.</string>
  <string id="6143322">You're a very odd dwarf.</string>
  <string id="6143325">And you thought I was joking about the pin.</string>
  <string id="6143330">So where's your beard, elf?</string>
  <string id="6143333">Elves don't grow beards.</string>
  <string id="6143336">Huh. I thought maybe you'd shaved it off in a fit of broody pique.</string>
  <string id="6143339">So you're a funny dwarf.</string>
  <string id="6143344">So you found your brother.</string>
  <string id="6143347">I did! Wasn't expecting that.</string>
  <string id="6143350">I assume there was a time when you and he were friends?</string>
  <string id="6143353">With Bartrand? No, just brothers. Occasionally he wasn't insufferable.</string>
  <string id="6143356">And yet you remained at his side.</string>
  <string id="6143359">Too bad he didn't do the same.</string>
  <string id="6143364">You know, if you need advice on how to lay low I can give you some.</string>
  <string id="6143367">Being short would make for an excellent start, I suspect.</string>
  <string id="6143370">Keep that up, serah, and you can keep on hiding like a rank amateur.</string>
  <string id="6143373">What would you suggest, Varric? Cower in the shadows like a rat?</string>
  <string id="6143376">You could try wearing something that didn't scream: I hate you all! I was a slave!</string>
  <string id="6143379">The markings would still show.</string>
  <string id="6143382">Really? Through anything? That's... kind of cool.</string>
  <string id="6143387">So who is Bianca?</string>
  <string id="6143390">My crossbow. Say hello, Bianca.</string>
  <string id="6143393">But why Bianca? You must have named her after someone.</string>
  <string id="6143396">Nope. Mirabelle was taken.</string>
  <string id="6143399">The way you fondle your weapon is disturbing.</string>
  <string id="6143402">Hey! I'm a perfect gentleman. In public.</string>
  <string id="6143407">I notice you hardly ever comment on mages and templars and such.</string>
  <string id="6143410">It's a lot of humans in skirts. I get them mixed up.</string>
  <string id="6143413">I highly doubt that. The subject comes up all the time.</string>
  <string id="6143416">Tell me about it.</string>
  <string id="6143419">And no opinion? One way or the other?</string>
  <string id="6143422">Opinions are like testicles. You kick them hard enough, doesn't matter how many you got.</string>
  <string id="6143425">That's... something.</string>
  <string id="6143439">Well, look who it is. You. The you.</string>
  <string id="6143442">If you don't mind, I could do with a significant reduction in the amount of attention this office receives.</string>
  <string id="6143445">A visit from the Champion is something of the opposite.</string>
  <string id="6143446">Order my removal if you think you have the authority.</string>
  <string id="6143447">You're in charge?</string>
  <string id="6143448">Everyone else seems to want me on their side.</string>
  <string id="6143449">An odd reaction.</string>
  <string id="6143450">I am not everyone else. I am the seneschal, a position that does not traditionally endure sans viscount.</string>
  <string id="6143453">I sense I am unwelcome in the halls of power.</string>
  <string id="6143454">So, get out?</string>
  <string id="6143455">Laughs Power? I am just the hand on the seal, waxing what I'm told.</string>
  <string id="6143458">And it isn't going well?</string>
  <string id="6143467">Do the words political maelstrom mean anything to you?</string>
  <string id="6143470">The templars are particularly sensitive about destabilizing elements, especially after what happened to Dumar.</string>
  <string id="6143471">When viscounts die, it's the sycophants who truly suffer.</string>
  <string id="6143472">Poor you.</string>
  <string id="6143473">If his death was more fresh in my mind, I would give you such a... censuring. I can still do that, I think?</string>
  <string id="6143479">Each day is fresh insult. Leave me.</string>
  <string id="6143480">Nice mess. Glad it's not mine.</string>
  <string id="6143481">You're on your own.</string>
  <string id="6143482">That is the prevailing opinion I encounter, and I'm just fine with that.</string>
  <string id="6143485">I'll leave you to it, but I'm easy to find if you need me.</string>
  <string id="6143486">Find me if you need me.</string>
  <string id="6143487">Good. Thank you. My door is always closed.</string>
  <string id="6143490">That's all I need. The Champion.</string>
  <string id="6143498">Since when are city leaders appointed by the knight-commander?</string>
  <string id="6143499">The templars decide who rules?</string>
  <string id="6143500">Meredith would not openly declare a preference. The rule of Kirkwall is deliberately separate from the Chantry's will.</string>
  <string id="6143503">But... the order embodies security in Kirkwall, and they want the new viscount to be more... accepting of oversight.</string>
  <string id="6143506">There is no one to carry the last viscount's line?</string>
  <string id="6143507">Dumar left no heirs?</string>
  <string id="6143508">You presided over Saemus's death. That was the sad end of the Dumars.</string>
  <string id="6143511">When a line is judged unfit, or ends, we appoint from Kirkwall's elite.</string>
  <string id="6143514">Or we would, if the situation was normal. But it is not.</string>
  <string id="6143515">Who nominates a new viscount?</string>
  <string id="6143516">Is the viscount voted on?</string>
  <string id="6143517">A consensus of the nobility. Normally. And a willing nominee.</string>
  <string id="6143520">Both are lacking, and I can't fault it. These are difficult times.</string>
  <string id="6143523">Could I nominate someone, or do it myself?</string>
  <string id="6143526">You are many things, Champion, but not this. Not yet, anyway.</string>
  <string id="6143602">Message for you.</string>
  <string id="6143605">About bloody time. We'll deliver the cargo soon as we've unloaded the Antivan Queen.</string>
  <string id="6143624">I can't keep the lyrium on the docks. Maybe dump it in the sea?</string>
  <string id="6143628">The harbormaster's office filled the order. I just need a destination. Where are we sending it?</string>
  <string id="6143631">The viscount will not store raw lyrium in the Keep!</string>
  <string id="6143634">Then where do I put it? I can't just leave impounded lyrium lying on the docks!</string>
  <string id="6143637">That's your problem.</string>
  <string id="6143640">Flaming bureaucrats.</string>
  <string id="6143643">Written on this scroll are orders to move an impounded shipment of raw lyrium. Everything is filled out except who to send it to.</string>
  <string id="6143644">You fill in Ser Conrad's name and pick up the scroll.</string>
  <string id="6143645">Write in Conrad's name.</string>
  <string id="6143647">Leave the scroll alone.</string>
  <string id="6143651">Anyone know Ser Keran? Has he... um... done anything wrong?</string>
  <string id="6143674">I can apply influence in many ways, you know.</string>
  <string id="6143675">Why fear my help?</string>
  <string id="6143679">The Arishok killed the viscount, but he's no longer a problem.</string>
  <string id="6143680">The Qunari threat is gone.</string>
  <string id="6143685">Jabber jabber jabber! That's all I hear from you two. Maybe a week of chamber pot cleaning will remind you of your duties.</string>
  <string id="6143695">I'm here to report Ser Conrad.</string>
  <string id="6143698">I know him. Did he do... something? Or something?</string>
  <string id="6143699">One moment. Are you well?</string>
  <string id="6143700">Are you all right?</string>
  <string id="6143701">Oh, it's just the... you know. Hard to think sometimes.</string>
  <string id="6143704">But I will do my duty. If you've seen something... um... suspicious, let me know.</string>
  <string id="6143705">Ser Conrad caught some apostates. They offered him coin to let them go, and he took it.</string>
  <string id="6143706">Conrad was bribed by mages.</string>
  <string id="6143707">Ser Conrad? Are you sure?</string>
  <string id="6143710">I'm afraid so.</string>
  <string id="6143713">Last night, I saw Ser Conrad sacrificing a goat... to the Great Demon. Then he howled. Loudly.</string>
  <string id="6143714">He's been sacrificing goats.</string>
  <string id="6143715">W-What? Demon?</string>
  <string id="6143718">Oh, yes. He was carrying on about how much he wanted to do... demony things.</string>
  <string id="6143721">What? No!</string>
  <string id="6143724">I tell you, that Ser Conrad must be an abomination or something.</string>
  <string id="6143727">I saw Ser Conrad stab one of the city guardsman. He dumped him in the bay.</string>
  <string id="6143728">I saw him murder someone.</string>
  <string id="6143729">W-What? Why would he do that?</string>
  <string id="6143732">You calling me a liar? I saw him kill a man in cold blood.</string>
  <string id="6143735">This needs to be reported! I can't believe it.</string>
  <string id="6143748">You ever notice the way those Qunari look at you? It's like they're judging you.</string>
  <string id="6143754">Or trying to decide how to prepare you for dinner.</string>
  <string id="6143757">Fenris</string>
  <string id="6143761">Bartrand's Estate</string>
  <string id="6143762">Bartrand's Estate</string>
  <string id="6143774">Merrill</string>
  <string id="6143789">So you give her flowers and all is forgiven? After what you did?</string>
  <string id="6143792">How I treat Angelique is my own affair.</string>
  <string id="6143795">You're toying with her, Conrad, just to satisfy your lusts. She deserves better!</string>
  <string id="6143798">I have Meredith's ear, Terrell. Careful how you address me.</string>
  <string id="6143801">There are older hatreds that the templars feel deserve more central focus.</string>
  <string id="6143804">Sometimes I wonder if we are at war with ourselves.</string>
  <string id="6143810">Where is Conrad?</string>
  <string id="6143812">Maybe it freed itself?</string>
  <string id="6143813">Could it escape?</string>
  <string id="6143816">You couldn't just set him loose. Nobody could. Not without doing something terrible. This is very wrong.</string>
  <string id="6143818">So much for that idea.</string>
  <string id="6143819">It couldn't have just vanished. We'll track it down.</string>
  <string id="6143820">We have to find it.</string>
  <string id="6143821">How are we going to finish the mirror now?</string>
  <string id="6143822">I hope you had a plan B.</string>
  <string id="6143865">I could use some flowers.</string>
  <string id="6143866">I'll buy some.</string>
  <string id="6143867">Picked just this morning, messere!</string>
  <string id="6143870">Not right now.</string>
  <string id="6143871">No thanks.</string>
  <string id="6143872">Fresh flowers! Surest way to a woman's heart. And the soft places underneath. Laughs</string>
  <string id="6143957">Are those flowers for me?</string>
  <string id="6143960">They're from Ser Terrell.</string>
  <string id="6143963">T-Terrell? He sent these?</string>
  <string id="6143966">He never even... Conrad and I are through. Terrell would never treat me as badly as that brute has!</string>
  <string id="6143969">We're done, then. Let's get back to Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6143970">I guess this means there's nothing we can do.</string>
  <string id="6143971">And I was so hoping to meet your demon. I guess we'll have to go home.</string>
  <string id="6143980">I don't know. I don't understand what's happened. How can he be gone?</string>
  <string id="6144043">No, you don't understand. He couldn't leave this place. Something dreadful had to happen for this cave to be empty.</string>
  <string id="6144054">Not here! Too open! Go. Go!</string>
  <string id="6144057">I know better than to take on something like that blind. You're on your own.</string>
  <string id="6144058">I won't help.</string>
  <string id="6144062">This is it! The sela petrae should have formed right under here. </string>
  <string id="6144063">This looks like a drakestone deposit. I need a scraping from the deepest part.</string>
  <string id="6144066">Maybe it's not so bad.</string>
  <string id="6144073">Obviously a human though. No mistaking that. Even hooded, you all look alike.</string>
  <string id="6144078">Fine. Don't trust me! But don't expect I'll ever trust you again after that.</string>
  <string id="6144081">Is this what you want, Hawke?</string>
  <string id="6144082">You're on your own.</string>
  <string id="6144083">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6144087">Have you changed your mind, Champion? Recently, you seemed to support the knight-commander.</string>
  <string id="6144095">It was a near thing, what happened in Ferelden. But in the end, the Maker stepped in.</string>
  <string id="6144096">I hear a lot about the knight-commander here. What can you tell me?</string>
  <string id="6144097">Tell me about Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6144098">Why are Circle mages here kept in a Tevinter prison?</string>
  <string id="6144099">Why keep mages in the Gallows?</string>
  <string id="6144101">He works in mysterious ways.</string>
  <string id="6144102">The Hero of Ferelden stopped the Blight. The Maker had nothing to do with it.</string>
  <string id="6144103">That wasn't the Maker.</string>
  <string id="6144107">It doesn't matter what I do now. The wheels are in motion.</string>
  <string id="6144108">You will not be disappointed by your faith in me.</string>
  <string id="6144109">Being a friend doesn't mean I have to agree with your every decision.</string>
  <string id="6144110">I am your friend.</string>
  <string id="6144116">You weren't listening.</string>
  <string id="6144127">Connor and Teagan were safely escorted to their ship.</string>
  <string id="6144135">Hey, Norah! You and me in my room, upstairs. What do you say?</string>
  <string id="6144138">Not if you were the last man in the Free Marches.</string>
  <string id="6144142">It's three bits for a mug.</string>
  <string id="6144145">What? You think I'm made of coin?</string>
  <string id="6144186">If you hadn't been obsessed with that stupid mirror, she'd still be alive.</string>
  <string id="6144189">You knew consorting with demons was dangerous. You knew people could get hurt, and you did it anyway.</string>
  <string id="6144192">Exactly which part of, Don't talk to demons or awful things will happen did you fail to understand?</string>
  <string id="6144205">Take a seat, and I'll get you a mug of ale... if I remember.</string>
  <string id="6144207">I left the clan! I went away so that she'd be safe!</string>
  <string id="6144209">She loved you.</string>
  <string id="6144214">But I... No one should have been at risk but me.</string>
  <string id="6144218">Can I... can I get another?</string>
  <string id="6144221">You've had enough.</string>
  <string id="6144242">Your mother is with the gentleman now, messere.</string>
  <string id="6144248">My lord, I'm... so sorry.</string>
  <string id="6144251">My lady, I'm... so sorry.</string>
  <string id="6144254">Mistress Amell was a fine woman. Reminded me of my own mother.</string>
  <string id="6144257">If there's anything I can do...</string>
  <string id="6144263">There's an... elven woman here, messere?</string>
  <string id="6144266">She claims she was sent here by you. I, ah, didn't know what to tell her.</string>
  <string id="6144272">I heard about the business in the square, messere. I hope there's no trouble from it.</string>
  <string id="6144275">Now that you're the Champion of Kirkwall, it seems everyone wants something, don't they? sighs</string>
  <string id="6144278">Mistress Amell would have been very proud.</string>
  <string id="6144281">Ah, you've returned!</string>
  <string id="6144284">I hope all is well?</string>
  <string id="6144287">Good to see you again, messere.</string>
  <string id="6144290">You've had luck on your travels?</string>
  <string id="6144293">Welcome home, messere.</string>
  <string id="6144299">You have a guest waiting in the hall.</string>
  <string id="6144302">Oh, and a letter also arrived earlier. It's on your desk, as usual.</string>
  <string id="6144306">A letter arrived for you. It's on the desk—that's where I'll put messages which come while you're out.</string>
  <string id="6144307">There's another letter waiting on your desk. At your leisure.</string>
  <string id="6144308">Another message came while you were away. It's on your desk.</string>
  <string id="6144309">There's a letter for you—strange how the messengers never come while you're home.</string>
  <string id="6144310">A new letter on your desk awaits your attention.</string>
  <string id="6144314">Mistress Amell just returned not long ago herself, I believe.</string>
  <string id="6144315">Sandal and your hound are getting along famously. It boggles the mind, truly.</string>
  <string id="6144316">I cleaned up the damage your hound caused yesterday. It took three hours. Sighs</string>
  <string id="6144317">Your hound escaped—again. It took me all afternoon just to find that cursed thing!</string>
  <string id="6144320">Er... pardon my saying so, messere.</string>
  <string id="6144321">Nothing new to report, I'm afraid.</string>
  <string id="6144322">Everything's quiet here in the mansion—for the moment.</string>
  <string id="6144323">May I say again how thankful I am you've allowed Sandal to remain? He seems very happy.</string>
  <string id="6144324">No attacks, no disasters, no out-of-control enchantments... it's a good day.</string>
  <string id="6144325">If you need me for anything, by all means let me know.</string>
  <string id="6144329">Hey, I know you... you're that... that... person.</string>
  <string id="6144330">You work here, right? I'll get more of that ale!</string>
  <string id="6144332">Why doesn't she love me? What did I do wrong?</string>
  <string id="6144336">Hey! That's not Gamlen! Get them!</string>
  <string id="6144340">Leandra... dead. I-I can't believe it. </string>
  <string id="6144341">I wasted my whole youth chasing some shiny rock.</string>
  <string id="6144342">A daughter... I can't believe Mara never told me.</string>
  <string id="6144343">Fine. Keep it to yourself. What do I care?</string>
  <string id="6144344">I told you not to go!</string>
  <string id="6144347">I don't need another lecture.</string>
  <string id="6144350">You got the damned estate. Why don't you go back there and stay out of my business?</string>
  <string id="6144353">We know the Keeper came here. What's going on? Where is she?</string>
  <string id="6144358">Why couldn't she have believed in me?</string>
  <string id="6144361">This never should have happened.</string>
  <string id="6144364">I don't know what to do now.</string>
  <string id="6144378">Hey, friend... could you spare a few silvers? I... er... I got children to feed.</string>
  <string id="6144379">I love this place. Don't you love this place?</string>
  <string id="6144380">I once fell asleep in that corner. It's quite comfy, if you don't mind the rats. Cheaper than a room, too.</string>
  <string id="6144381">I've seen you around Lowtown, haven't I?</string>
  <string id="6144386">Fenarel, the Keeper, she...</string>
  <string id="6144389">Look at her, Fenarel! She's covered in blood!</string>
  <string id="6144391">Teagan</string>
  <string id="6144395">What have you done, Merrill? Keeper! Can you hear me?</string>
  <string id="6144398">She's dead.</string>
  <string id="6144401">I should have guessed you'd turn on her, you monster.</string>
  <string id="6144402">The Keeper turned into a demon. We had no choice.</string>
  <string id="6144403">Marethari was possessed.</string>
  <string id="6144404">Connor</string>
  <string id="6144426">I am struggling to find a reason to care.</string>
  <string id="6144429">I would caution that stability is the policymaker's best friend.</string>
  <string id="6144430">The office of the viscount is not open to the public. Especially recent arrivals not actually part of the public.</string>
  <string id="6144431">This was a tragedy. I promise you, I'll make sure no one else is hurt by Merrill's blood magic.</string>
  <string id="6144432">I'll take responsibility.</string>
  <string id="6144435">Your help was appreciated, but that relationship is concluded. Thank you for not entirely offending this office.</string>
  <string id="6144450">If you're here to see Keran, it's not worth the effort.</string>
  <string id="6144453">Wilmod, Keran, and I were close once. And now? Wilmod's dead. Keran kidnapped, then discharged from the Order.</string>
  <string id="6144457">The knight-captain did what he had to, but at great cost.</string>
  <string id="6144458">It was a tragedy.</string>
  <string id="6144459">At least he isn't possessed by a demon. Well, that we know of.</string>
  <string id="6144460">It's not all that bad.</string>
  <string id="6144461">Is that some sort of joke? Sighs</string>
  <string id="6144467">Is there a point to your belly-aching?</string>
  <string id="6144468">I don't have time for this.</string>
  <string id="6144469">You're right. There's something I'd like to do.</string>
  <string id="6144472">I've heard his family is in deep with a Tevinter moneylender near here. Senestra the Snake.</string>
  <string id="6144475">Keran's father is too proud—his children don't even know. If I were rich enough, I'd pay off the debt myself.</string>
  <string id="6144476">And I take it this alternative involves me. Go on.</string>
  <string id="6144477">What's your idea?</string>
  <string id="6144480">I know where this is going. Find someone else.</string>
  <string id="6144481">Not interested.</string>
  <string id="6144484">This is a test of the emergency broadcast system. If this had been a real emergency, you would already have been nuked back to the stone age. </string>
  <string id="6144516">No one is going to hurt Merrill while I'm here.</string>
  <string id="6144517">Stand down.</string>
  <string id="6144518">Magic has nothing to do with this, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6144519">You're blaming magic?</string>
  <string id="6144520">No? Greed for it didn't bring Danarius here, make my sister betray me?</string>
  <string id="6144523">Don't do this, Hawke. I need you.</string>
  <string id="6144524">You owe me.</string>
  <string id="6144527">I suppose I can't let him just take you.</string>
  <string id="6144530">Why not? He might have something better on him anyhow.</string>
  <string id="6144556">Thank you for your assistance, Serah Hawke. For obvious reasons, it is no longer required.</string>
  <string id="6144557">The viscount's boy was his own worst enemy. Again.</string>
  <string id="6144558">Saemus's death was his fault.</string>
  <string id="6144559">The viscount's boy was determined to come to a bad end.</string>
  <string id="6144560">Saemus's death was his fault.</string>
  <string id="6144561">A man's child is dead. A boy that ran in these halls. Whatever his faults, this is a tragedy.</string>
  <string id="6144564">I should think that someone truly deserving of their place in Hightown would recognize that.</string>
  <string id="6144567">I am, apparently, something of an optimist.</string>
  <string id="6144570">You were very critical of Saemus before.</string>
  <string id="6144571">But you thought he was trouble.</string>
  <string id="6144572">Saemus's death can't go unanswered.</string>
  <string id="6144573">This demands a response.</string>
  <string id="6144574">I have no doubt that an answer is coming. He held unconventional friends, and they will be as saddened by this as I am.</string>
  <string id="6144577">At least, I hope their reaction is sadness. I fear we will not survive anything else.</string>
  <string id="6144580">I should think it has already been answered. I hope, anyway.</string>
  <string id="6144583">If it escalates, this is merely the first of many losses.</string>
  <string id="6144586">Oh, child, you were such a fool. I shall miss that.</string>
  <string id="6144589">There would have been no demon if it weren't for this little flat-eared bitch!</string>
  <string id="6144590">You expect us to take the word of a shemlen?</string>
  <string id="6144591">You murder our Keeper and think you can threaten us, shem?</string>
  <string id="6144599">Stand down, Ineria!</string>
  <string id="6144602">We've suffered enough because of this traitor. It ends now!</string>
  <string id="6144620">She was our First, once. The Keeper loved her. More than she loved the clan, it seems.</string>
  <string id="6144626">Fools!</string>
  <string id="6144627">I have prepared for you!</string>
  <string id="6144628">You cannot win here!</string>
  <string id="6144629">You should not have come!</string>
  <string id="6144630">Kaffar!</string>
  <string id="6144631">Vishante!</string>
  <string id="6144635">Attack this one, you idiots!</string>
  <string id="6144636">Attack my foe!</string>
  <string id="6144640">Gather around me!</string>
  <string id="6144644">It seems I'll have to use something else!</string>
  <string id="6144648">I need a potion!</string>
  <string id="6144656">What holds me?</string>
  <string id="6144661">I have nothing left!</string>
  <string id="6144662">Why is this taking so long?</string>
  <string id="6144666">No! It cannot end like this!</string>
  <string id="6144667">Too much!</string>
  <string id="6144671">I hope you rot!</string>
  <string id="6144672">There! We have them!</string>
  <string id="6144676">It does nothing?</string>
  <string id="6144680">You cannot evade me!</string>
  <string id="6144684">Get the mage!</string>
  <string id="6144688">The archer! The archer!</string>
  <string id="6144692">Fenedhis!</string>
  <string id="6144734">Probably for the best. Good day.</string>
  <string id="6144737">Senestra—by all accounts—is a cancer on our most downtrodden.</string>
  <string id="6144740">Maker preserve me, but I believe the world would be a better place without her.</string>
  <string id="6144743">If you help Keran, I vow I'll send you what coin I have. I-I must go.</string>
  <string id="6144746">Kirkwall</string>
  <string id="6144748">Courtyard</string>
  <string id="6144749">Gallows Market</string>
  <string id="6144750">Mage</string>
  <string id="6144756">Mage</string>
  <string id="6144760">Fenarel... I'm sorry. I never wanted this. If I could have saved her... if I could have died instead, I would have.</string>
  <string id="6144763">Words are cheap. That you're still breathing says enough.</string>
  <string id="6144771">Cleaning chamber pots! But... the new initiates are the ones—</string>
  <string id="6144774">I'm sure the initiates would happily give up the honor for you.</string>
  <string id="6144777">A very sad affair.</string>
  <string id="6144778">You don't watch a child become a man and not feel something when he is lost.</string>
  <string id="6144781">We had some spirited discussions. He would challenge this or that, and I would scramble to avoid offense.</string>
  <string id="6144784">His loss will have an effect, of that I am certain.</string>
  <string id="6144811">Enough, Ineria! Human, take Merrill away from here.</string>
  <string id="6144814">We don't care what you do with her. But if she returns here, we will kill her.</string>
  <string id="6144840">How unfortunate that the guard captain intends to give up her position. Transition is not kind to intermediaries such as myself.</string>
  <string id="6144841">I am glad that the captain has seen fit to retain her position. She is orderly, if nothing else.</string>
  <string id="6144847">Now where has that new initiate gotten to? I just turned my back for a minute.</string>
  <string id="6144850">Young lady, if you see a girl with a large head and ears like cauliflower, can you send her my way?</string>
  <string id="6144851">Young man, if you see a girl with a large head and ears like cauliflower, can you send her my way?</string>
  <string id="6144863">Your dalliance with the woman who caused the Qunari incident is troubling, Champion. Troubling, but understandable.</string>
  <string id="6144866">You heard about that Deep Roads expedition? They say anyone who goes down there's going to be rich.</string>
  <string id="6144869">You don't think they'll need drinks served down there, do you?</string>
  <string id="6144873">I'm here about Keran's family debt.</string>
  <string id="6144901">Senestra's dead and I feel like laughing. I must go to the chantry and beg forgiveness.</string>
  <string id="6144906">So many expenses. If only Keran got paid regularly. Sighs</string>
  <string id="6144915">Keep the Maker in your heart, and he will guide your grandson to you, dear woman.</string>
  <string id="6144924">All those people, gone forever...</string>
  <string id="6144927">So much death because of me...</string>
  <string id="6144930">Is it Satinalia already? Hawke just strolls over here.</string>
  <string id="6144933">A lot of people would pay dearly to see you face down in the gutter.</string>
  <string id="6144936">And who am I to deny them that? Kill 'em, boys!</string>
  <string id="6144939">What happens if they don't like the choice?</string>
  <string id="6144940">And if they don't approve?</string>
  <string id="6144941">Do you know how Viscount Dumar's predecessor, Perrin Threnhold, left office?</string>
  <string id="6144944">He was a tyrant, certainly, but his rule was not ended until he actively sought to expel the templars.</string>
  <string id="6144947">The good of all is inexorably tied to what is good for the templars.</string>
  <string id="6144948">I suppose we can add pest control to your already-impressive list of accomplishments. Dragons. Wonderful.</string>
  <string id="6144949">Aveline's name has been cleared, but she still seems troubled.</string>
  <string id="6144955">Templar Lieutenant</string>
  <string id="6144958">No Keeper, no clan, no people... I have nobody but you. </string>
  <string id="6144959">My people will kill me if I go back. I'm all alone.</string>
  <string id="6144976">The Maker will let it fall right off if you do that again, boy.</string>
  <string id="6144978">But they chose to destroy themselves in order to escape my help.</string>
  <string id="6144979">You're not responsible for their stupidity.</string>
  <string id="6144980">Forget the clan.</string>
  <string id="6144981">They weren't listening to reason. There was nothing you could have done.</string>
  <string id="6144982">Stop blaming yourself.</string>
  <string id="6144983">They got their wish. There is absolutely no way you can help them now.</string>
  <string id="6144984">It worked!</string>
  <string id="6145087">So you've done well for yourself.</string>
  <string id="6145090">I had my doubts the first time I saw you, but... I guess there was something to that Hawke fellow Leandra ran off with after all.</string>
  <string id="6145093">He certainly produced an amazing daughter. Your mother would be proud.</string>
  <string id="6145094">He made a pretty good son, anyway. Your mother would be proud.</string>
  <string id="6145095">And you? How are you and Charade getting along?</string>
  <string id="6145096">How's fatherhood?</string>
  <string id="6145097">She's just like me. It's terrifying.</string>
  <string id="6145100">Kind of a kick, though. I see what Leandra got out of this whole having children thing.</string>
  <string id="6145103">She's the only one who's ever wanted to see my whole collection of dirty Rivaini playing cards!</string>
  <string id="6145104">Any more personal problems you need help with? Another ambush to send me to... for old time's sake?</string>
  <string id="6145105">Anything else going on?</string>
  <string id="6145106">Funny, most of my old enemies gave up on me since you got so famous.</string>
  <string id="6145109">Now, I just sit and bask in your reflected glory.</string>
  <string id="6145110">I just wish Mother had lived to see me become Champion.</string>
  <string id="6145111">I miss Mother.</string>
  <string id="6145112">I know Leandra, and she'd be absolutely glowing from all the praise that's been heaped on you.</string>
  <string id="6145115">I don't say this often, but...</string>
  <string id="6145118">Uncle Gamlen, was that... affection?</string>
  <string id="6145119">I didn't know you cared.</string>
  <string id="6145120">What are you angling for?</string>
  <string id="6145121">I don't trust you.</string>
  <string id="6145122">I'm feeling sentimental.</string>
  <string id="6145125">We're the only family we've both got left.</string>
  <string id="6145128">With your brother in the templars, you're the only real family I've got.</string>
  <string id="6145131">With Bethany locked in the Gallows, you're the only real family I have left.</string>
  <string id="6145134">For a long time, I thought the Amell line in Kirkwall would end at me. I'm glad you've pulled it out of the grave.</string>
  <string id="6145138">For it to end like this...</string>
  <string id="6145139">No, I know that.</string>
  <string id="6145140">It didn't have to end like this.</string>
  <string id="6145141">What will I do now?</string>
  <string id="6145142">Do what you want with your life. It's up to you.</string>
  <string id="6145143">Whatever you like.</string>
  <string id="6145144">There are plenty of elves in Kirkwall who could use your help.</string>
  <string id="6145145">Help the alienage.</string>
  <string id="6145146">There's no reason you can't keep trying to find out about your people's past.</string>
  <string id="6145147">Keep studying elven history.</string>
  <string id="6145148">Wounded Coast</string>
  <string id="6145150">City Guardsman</string>
  <string id="6145154">City Guardsman</string>
  <string id="6145158">City Guardsman</string>
  <string id="6145162">City Guardsman</string>
  <string id="6145164">Whatever you do next, we'll do together.</string>
  <string id="6145165">Stay with me.</string>
  <string id="6145172">Are you ordering a drink or not?</string>
  <string id="6145175">I cannot drink. I must keep my mind pure so the words may flow through me like a crystal-clear stream.</string>
  <string id="6145178">Look, friend. I'm pretty sure your words are nothing like a crystal-clear stream.</string>
  <string id="6145181">In fact, if I had to draw a comparison, I'd say your words are like a brown sludge that stinks up the place.</string>
  <string id="6145184">Now what matches that description?</string>
  <string id="6145187">Sobs</string>
  <string id="6145196">I shall not be left to wander the drifting roads of the Fade, for there is no... there is no...</string>
  <string id="6145199">Oh Maker... why can't I remember how it goes?</string>
  <string id="6145203">So what's it take to make a man write poetry about you, huh?</string>
  <string id="6145206">A soul like tattered lace. Eyes filled with exquisite despair. Lips that have tasted mortality.</string>
  <string id="6145209">Laughs You are so full of shit.</string>
  <string id="6145212">Leaving anything up to me seems a bit dangerous now, don't you think?</string>
  <string id="6145213">That's true... the Dalish always say we're the only true elves. And I've lived here for years, and never thought...</string>
  <string id="6145214">I suppose I can do that even without the mirror.</string>
  <string id="6145218">Barks</string>
  <string id="6145219">Easy, boy. I'm busy. We'll play later.</string>
  <string id="6145220">Calm down, boy.</string>
  <string id="6145224">Who's a funny puppy! You are! Yes you are!</string>
  <string id="6145225">Aw, cute boy!</string>
  <string id="6145226">Happy bark!</string>
  <string id="6145229">You're a killer. Quit prancing around like some Orlesian bitch.</string>
  <string id="6145230">Stop that.</string>
  <string id="6146781">Things have been very troubling these last few years, haven't they?</string>
  <string id="6146784">I, ah... I was thinking that it might soon be time for my boy and I to move on.</string>
  <string id="6146785">What about your so-called debt?</string>
  <string id="6146786">I thought you owed me?</string>
  <string id="6146787">Well, I have served you for years, now.</string>
  <string id="6146790">Not to mention that you do have Orana. You don't really need me.</string>
  <string id="6146793">Back to the merchant's life, I suppose?</string>
  <string id="6146794">Where would you go?</string>
  <string id="6146795">Who'll clean up all the bloodstains?</string>
  <string id="6146796">I'd need a new manservant?</string>
  <string id="6146797">Chuckles There's more bloody footprints in this home than anywhere else in Kirkwall, I swear.</string>
  <string id="6146800">It's an honor to serve the Champion of Kirkwall, make no mistake, but I'm getting older. It's time to see to Sandal's future.</string>
  <string id="6146803">I'll stay on until arrangements are made. I hope that's all right.</string>
  <string id="6146804">I didn't need a manservant in the first place.</string>
  <string id="6146805">I never asked you to stay.</string>
  <string id="6146806">Good. Then it's settled.</string>
  <string id="6146809">If you're worried about Sandal, I can help him out.</string>
  <string id="6146810">I could help Sandal.</string>
  <string id="6146811">Ah, that's mighty kind of you, but it's unnecessary. My boy's been offered a position in Orlais.</string>
  <string id="6146814">It seems the empress herself found one of his enchantments and is intrigued. Can you imagine? Us, in the Imperial court!</string>
  <string id="6146817">I'm almost tempted to go along with you.</string>
  <string id="6146818">Can I come along?</string>
  <string id="6146819">Laughs Have a bit of the wanderlust yourself, eh?</string>
  <string id="6146822">Hopefully this business with the templars doesn't get worse before we go. I worry about you, messere.</string>
  <string id="6146828">It's been quite pleasant having Master Anders staying here, messere.</string>
  <string id="6146831">He's funny.</string>
  <string id="6146834">And he finds my boy's enchanting quite intriguing. That's the word he used!</string>
  <string id="6146837">It's too bad he seems so... intent on whatever it is he works on.</string>
  <string id="6146838">If I may say so, I don't think Mistress Merrill is exactly... comfortable staying in the estate.</string>
  <string id="6146841">She's pretty!</string>
  <string id="6146844">She still goes to the alienage often. Usually when you're not home.</string>
  <string id="6146847">Something draws her there. I can't imagine what.</string>
  <string id="6146850">I suppose a Dalish elf isn't used to having a roof over her head? Even after all these years.</string>
  <string id="6146853">Still, my boy and I do like her very much. Just thought you should know.</string>
  <string id="6146854">If you need any enchantments, I'm sure my boy would be happy to help.</string>
  <string id="6146857">Enchantment!</string>
  <string id="6146860">Just so.</string>
  <string id="6146861">Quite a lovely estate you have here. Isn't that right, Sandal?</string>
  <string id="6146864">I like the doggie.</string>
  <string id="6146867">Happy bark!</string>
  <string id="6146868">I'm sorry I broke it.</string>
  <string id="6146871">Ah... yes, well, we'll get that replaced right away. Sorry about that.</string>
  <string id="6146872">You'd almost never know little Orana was even here. So quiet!</string>
  <string id="6146875">She smells like cinnamon buns.</string>
  <string id="6146878">Even after all these years, she still refuses to go outside. Such a shame.</string>
  <string id="6146879">I've tried getting the mabari smell out of the rug, but...</string>
  <string id="6146882">Whines</string>
  <string id="6146885">Yes, yes, you just stay over there where you belong.</string>
  <string id="6146888">I swear that dog is too smart for his own good.</string>
  <string id="6146889">You know, maybe that hound of yours isn't so bad.</string>
  <string id="6146892">The doggie has stinky breath!</string>
  <string id="6146895">He hasn't tried to eat me. The way he stares at me sometimes, though...</string>
  <string id="6146898">He knows...</string>
  <string id="6146901">Exactly, yes! Frightening.</string>
  <string id="6146902">I'll miss this city when we go, somehow. Even the rats.</string>
  <string id="6146905">Rats go squeak!</string>
  <string id="6146908">Don't worry, my boy. There's plenty of rats in Orlais—they just squeak with a funny accent.</string>
  <string id="6146909">I'm certain you'll find everything's in order, messere.</string>
  <string id="6146910">All the cleaning's been done, and your equipment has been thoroughly tended.</string>
  <string id="6146911">Always at your service, messere.</string>
  <string id="6146912">Always at your service, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6146913">Glad to be of service!</string>
  <string id="6146919">Love is the essence of life. Without it, I am a fluffy kitten, wilting.</string>
  <string id="6146922">Water me with love so that my kitten may bloom again.</string>
  <string id="6146925">Kittens don't bloom.</string>
  <string id="6146928">You don't understand.</string>
  <string id="6146931">No, I'm pretty sure they don't bloom. Unless your kitten has a daisy growing out of its head.</string>
  <string id="6146936">What I want... I'm not even sure what that is, to be honest.</string>
  <string id="6146943">I do have this... not-exactly-working magic mirror. I might find some way to finish it.</string>
  <string id="6146951">You take good care of us, don't you? Want some pets? I bet you do.</string>
  <string id="6146952">You're a good mabari.</string>
  <string id="6146953">Who's a funny boy? You are! Yes, you are!</string>
  <string id="6146954">What a cute dog!</string>
  <string id="6146955">What? I can't read your mind.</string>
  <string id="6146956">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="6146957">Whimpers</string>
  <string id="6146962">Barks</string>
  <string id="6146963">Hush. Let's use our inside barks.</string>
  <string id="6146964">Quiet down, now.</string>
  <string id="6146965">Well, Woof! to you, too! Arf! R-r-r-ruff!</string>
  <string id="6146966">Bark!</string>
  <string id="6146967">Happy bark!</string>
  <string id="6146970">Keep us safe, boy. Watch that door.</string>
  <string id="6146971">You're a good guard dog.</string>
  <string id="6146972">Barks</string>
  <string id="6146977">So someone dropped off a message for you. It's on the desk.</string>
  <string id="6146980">Not that he didn't do his best to try and read it first.</string>
  <string id="6146983">What? I thought there might be something dangerous in there.</string>
  <string id="6146986">Not before he gave it a shake, to see if there were coins inside.</string>
  <string id="6146989">I was worried they would fall out!</string>
  <string id="6146992">Oh, Gamlen.</string>
  <string id="6146995">What am I, your servant? There's a letter for you on the desk.</string>
  <string id="6146996">Another messenger came by with a letter. It's on the desk.</string>
  <string id="6146997">Maker's breath! You get more letters than I do. There's another one on the desk.</string>
  <string id="6146998">Please go away. You are inspiration's nemesis.</string>
  <string id="6147004">What rhymes with cornucopia?</string>
  <string id="6147006">You know Isabela, don't you? Do you think I should compare her to a scintillating biscuit or a lonely outcropping of rock?</string>
  <string id="6147007">I can't think with you standing around.</string>
  <string id="6147008">The Chantry</string>
  <string id="6147015">I suppose I have a lot to think about, don't I?</string>
  <string id="6147018">I've barely even looked at them. I feel like such a fool.</string>
  <string id="6147021">Maybe all my training as a Keeper won't go to waste after all.</string>
  <string id="6147024">Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6147025">Yes. We will.</string>
  <string id="6147028">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6147029">Hahren na melana sahlin.</string>
  <string id="6147032">In uthenera na revas.</string>
  <string id="6147037">The Chantry</string>
  <string id="6147098">The Chantry</string>
  <string id="6147099">But those who anger her, they're struck from the earth... as if they never lived at all.</string>
  <string id="6147104">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6147110">Continue harassing our hunting parties, templar, and there will be consequences.</string>
  <string id="6147113">Hand over Feynriel. You heathens have no idea of the danger an apostate poses.</string>
  <string id="6147116">Elves were using magic when your primitive ancestors still lived like beasts. If you dare interrogate one of my hunters again—</string>
  <string id="6147119">The Maker be my witness, I will bring Feynriel to the Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6147122">Hawke? You may want to leave before this gets... messy.</string>
  <string id="6147123">Are you actually planning to attack templars?</string>
  <string id="6147124">What's going on, hunter?</string>
  <string id="6147125">This shem caught one of our da'len hunters. She tortured the boy with fire while she interrogated him about Feynriel.</string>
  <string id="6147128">That's nothing compared to what we'll do if you don't hand over the apostate!</string>
  <string id="6147131">This is your last chance to leave and avoid bloodshed, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6147132">You'd torture and kill the Dalish for just one apostate?</string>
  <string id="6147133">Is it worth all this, templar?</string>
  <string id="6147134">I don't care a jot about these knife-ears. But Feynriel slipped through our fingers.</string>
  <string id="6147137">No one escapes the knight-commander.</string>
  <string id="6147140">We would sooner die then turn him over to you!</string>
  <string id="6147141">If Feynriel is that dangerous, let him stay with the Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6147142">Let Feynriel be.</string>
  <string id="6147143">Why would I do that?</string>
  <string id="6147146">Either he snaps and the Dalish kill him, or he escapes and you capture him without risking your men. You win either way.</string>
  <string id="6147149">There is wisdom in that, I suppose. Very well. You Dalish have fun with Feynriel.</string>
  <string id="6147152">Violence would not have helped my people. Ma serannas.</string>
  <string id="6147155">You've done the templars a service today. Let's move out before we're ambushed by more knife-ears!</string>
  <string id="6147156">We must go! Ma serannas, friend.</string>
  <string id="6147157">You've gone too far, templar. I won't let you kill these people.</string>
  <string id="6147158">I stand with the Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6147159">Traitor!</string>
  <string id="6147163">Leave</string>
  <string id="6147164">I didn't want it to come to this.</string>
  <string id="6147167">You can't do this, hunter. Think of the templar's retaliation.</string>
  <string id="6147168">Don't attack the templars.</string>
  <string id="6147169">There will be no retaliation if none of these templars escape alive.</string>
  <string id="6147170">If you attack the templars, you must deal with me, as well.</string>
  <string id="6147171">I'll fight with the templars.</string>
  <string id="6147172">Abelas, Hawke. Leave no one alive!</string>
  <string id="6147179">And King Ellenden, in his wisdom, spared the child. And the crowd did cheer.</string>
  <string id="6147183">To those who hunger, food. To those who thirst, water. And to a brother in need, aid.</string>
  <string id="6147187">And as he lay down his heavy burden, the clouds did part.</string>
  <string id="6147190">The light did shine. And he knew he had done well.</string>
  <string id="6147196">Blessed are the peacekeepers, champions of the just.</string>
  <string id="6147197">For those who walk upright in this land will find passage to the Golden City.</string>
  <string id="6147198">An outstretched hand to those in need is worth more than all the rubies in a miser's vault.</string>
  <string id="6147199">For as the wicked shall be smited, so shall the virtuous be rewarded.</string>
  <string id="6147202">Though the lands suffer a thousand wrongs, the Maker yet notices the smallest of deeds.</string>
  <string id="6147206">So, I hear you've been playing house with that elf wench.</string>
  <string id="6147209">Those Dalish don't really wear clothes, right? Nice!</string>
  <string id="6147210">I hear you moved that apostate boy into your house.</string>
  <string id="6147213">You really are your mother's daughter.</string>
  <string id="6147214">So, I hear you've been slipping it to that pirate slut from the Hanged Man.</string>
  <string id="6147217">What's that like? Two women? I've always wondered...</string>
  <string id="6147218">The bitch turned me down flat.</string>
  <string id="6147219">So, you're into elves, huh?</string>
  <string id="6147222">It takes all kinds...</string>
  <string id="6147223">I guess I don't have to ask which one of you's the girl.</string>
  <string id="6147224">On second thought, don't tell me.</string>
  <string id="6147225">I don't want to know.</string>
  <string id="6147235">You're my only link to Leandra, to my childhood.</string>
  <string id="6147238">I know you say there's some daughter floating around, but as far as I know, you're my only real family.</string>
  <string id="6147244">Drinking from their tab again, huh?</string>
  <string id="6147247">You have to when you're dealing with this lot.</string>
  <string id="6147250">Let's see how you like drunk men pinching your ass and trying to lick you. Ech.</string>
  <string id="6147394">Do this, and the Maker's light shines upon you.</string>
  <string id="6147405">For when might and righteousness are common cause, the furthest star is within reach.</string>
  <string id="6147410">Your brother is a mage. As were your sister and father?</string>
  <string id="6147413">And I'm not. What of it?</string>
  <string id="6147416">Nothing, it's not always passed to all siblings. But it's good to know you understand our plight.</string>
  <string id="6147417">Your sisters are... were both mages, as was your father?</string>
  <string id="6147428">We've been here too long. Mythal protect us.</string>
  <string id="6147431">The hunters chased away another one last night.</string>
  <string id="6147434">Too many shemlen are coming here. We have to move soon.</string>
  <string id="6147437">Can't you talk to the Keeper? Reason with her?</string>
  <string id="6147440">I tried. She's made up her mind.</string>
  <string id="6147457">Enough! This is not what the Order stands for. Knight-Commander, step down. I relieve you of your command!</string>
  <string id="6147460">You'll have to go through me.</string>
  <string id="6147463">And me.</string>
  <string id="6147466">Traitors! I'll have both your heads!</string>
  <string id="6147515">What are you doing? Work with the grain of the wood, not against it!</string>
  <string id="6147527">Sorry, Master Ilen.</string>
  <string id="6147530">I told you that you were doing it wrong.</string>
  <string id="6147533">Shut up!</string>
  <string id="6147534">Don't hold the chisel like that. You'll cut off your thumb.</string>
  <string id="6147537">Yes, Master Ilen.</string>
  <string id="6147540">I wish you would.</string>
  <string id="6147543">If either of us is likely to cut themselves, it's you.</string>
  <string id="6147546">That's enough! More working, less talking!</string>
  <string id="6147556">I think... I've made this wrong.</string>
  <string id="6147559">It doesn't look that bad. What's it supposed to be?</string>
  <string id="6147562">If you can't tell what it is, then it's rubbish.</string>
  <string id="6147565">Hush!</string>
  <string id="6147568">It's meant to be a bowl.</string>
  <string id="6147571">Oh! Er... it's... a little flat for a bowl, perhaps.</string>
  <string id="6147574">Told you so.</string>
  <string id="6147587">The first of the Maker's children watched across the Veil and grew jealous of the life they could not feel, could not... much?</string>
  <string id="6147590">No... that can't be right.</string>
  <string id="6147591">Hahren Paivel. How does the day find you?</string>
  <string id="6147594">I'm an old man, Master Ilen. I have an old man's troubles. How are this lot doing?</string>
  <string id="6147605">Shove your plight.</string>
  <string id="6147608">They'll learn woodshaping. I may have to crack their skulls to get the knowledge inside, but they'll learn.</string>
  <string id="6147611">Oh, that's reassuring.</string>
  <string id="6147620">Oh! Sorry! I didn't see you there. Sister Alema told me I should keep my head up more often.</string>
  <string id="6147628">You don't like me, Carver?</string>
  <string id="6147631">I don't like you.</string>
  <string id="6147637">When I was a girl, the Amells were one of our most prominent families. I'm glad to have one of their line in the estate again.</string>
  <string id="6147640">How can I help you?</string>
  <string id="6147641">What is the Chantry's stance on the Qunari presence here?</string>
  <string id="6147642">How do we handle the Qunari?</string>
  <string id="6147643">Would it help anything for us to get involved? Or is it more likely to light the kindling? </string>
  <string id="6147646">If the Qunari act against us, the templars will defend Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6147649">Otherwise, we guard ourselves best by waiting.</string>
  <string id="6147653">Tell me of the Tranquil Solution.</string>
  <string id="6147654">Is it true the templars are planning to use the Rite of Tranquility on every mage in the city?</string>
  <string id="6147657">What? No! It's not an uncommon gripe to hear in the templar barracks, but the Chantry has never supported such a thing.</string>
  <string id="6147658">I think you should see these papers.</string>
  <string id="6147659">You knew my grandparents?</string>
  <string id="6147660">Let's hear about my family.</string>
  <string id="6147661">How long have you been grand cleric?</string>
  <string id="6147662">Tell me about yourself.</string>
  <string id="6147663">Are you intending to stay neutral about the Qunari and mages forever?</string>
  <string id="6147664">You should help the city.</string>
  <string id="6147665">I'd always welcome your benediction.</string>
  <string id="6147666">Give me your blessing.</string>
  <string id="6147667">Just get out of my way.</string>
  <string id="6147668">You're useless.</string>
  <string id="6147672">The Qunari presence here has stirred great controversy in the Chantry.</string>
  <string id="6147673">Several of our brothers and sisters take the Qunari too personally. The Maker would not have sent them if not to teach us something.</string>
  <string id="6147674">Seeker Cassandra was impressed with your presence of mind. Most people are too intimidated to speak freely with her.</string>
  <string id="6147675">Please leave. A foul murder has been committed within these walls. We must cleanse them.</string>
  <string id="6147676">I performed your grandparents' wedding ceremony. Leandra eloping broke their hearts.</string>
  <string id="6147677">Andraste guide your steps.</string>
  <string id="6147678">Gossip is a sin, child. Knight-Commander Meredith has an admirable devotion to her duties.</string>
  <string id="6147681">It is not my role to form opinions on her character.</string>
  <string id="6147682">Ah. So soon you take an interest in our problems.</string>
  <string id="6147685">The short answer is, it was a building. A large one. Should it have sat empty? The Chantry found a use for what was once a horror.</string>
  <string id="6147688">It is the nature of men to move on and forget the past. Even your Blight will be a distant memory in our lifetimes.</string>
  <string id="6147689">Can I get your benediction?</string>
  <string id="6147690">May I have your blessing?</string>
  <string id="6147691">May the Maker bless and keep you. May His smile grace all the days of your life and His light guide you to His side.</string>
  <string id="6147694">So let it be.</string>
  <string id="6147697">So let it be.</string>
  <string id="6147698">I have things to do.</string>
  <string id="6147699">I should go.</string>
  <string id="6147700">May you walk in Andraste's light.</string>
  <string id="6147701">The Maker answered our prayers.</string>
  <string id="6147704">I knew the Hero of Ferelden had outside help!</string>
  <string id="6147707">He wouldn't let the darkspawn win.</string>
  <string id="6147710">Mankind has been a trial to Him. We have turned our backs too many times.</string>
  <string id="6147713">He must allow us to suffer the consequences of our actions.</string>
  <string id="6147716">But He never burdens us with more than we can overcome.</string>
  <string id="6147717">Sometimes the Maker chooses the most unlikely vessels.</string>
  <string id="6147720">Even a dwarf may be doing His work.</string>
  <string id="6147723">Even a mage may be doing His work.</string>
  <string id="6147726">Even an elf may be doing His work.</string>
  <string id="6147729">We never know whose hand He may favor.</string>
  <string id="6147735">That's unfortunate. Hating someone just because they're a mage is a shameful thing.</string>
  <string id="6147740">Master, what's wrong?</string>
  <string id="6147743">Nothing, da'len. Pack those tools properly. We're leaving.</string>
  <string id="6147746">But the Keeper didn't say...</string>
  <string id="6147749">Just do it! We're leaving. Whether the clan is or not is up to them.</string>
  <string id="6147753">Don't stand so close! You're in the way!</string>
  <string id="6147756">One day the magic will come back. All of it.</string>
  <string id="6147759">Everyone will be just like they were. The shadows will part, and the skies will open wide.</string>
  <string id="6147762">Eh? What's this?</string>
  <string id="6147765">When he rises, everyone will see.</string>
  <string id="6147768">By the Ancestors, what's gotten into you, my boy?</string>
  <string id="6147771">Enchantment?</string>
  <string id="6147774">Hmph. That's more like it.</string>
  <string id="6147779">Boom!</string>
  <string id="6147782">Huh. There he goes again. How he makes these things I'll never know.</string>
  <string id="6147783">I've never seen another dwarf like him. Does this run in your family?</string>
  <string id="6147784">Has he always been like this?</string>
  <string id="6147785">So long as he doesn't engulf the place in flames.</string>
  <string id="6147786">Don't burn down the mansion.</string>
  <string id="6147787">No, no—he wouldn't do that. Again.</string>
  <string id="6147790">I should make it go boom?</string>
  <string id="6147793">No, no, no—not this time, my boy. No boom.</string>
  <string id="6147794">Sandal's quite useful to have around.</string>
  <string id="6147795">I'm grateful for his help.</string>
  <string id="6147796">That he is! Or so I've always said.</string>
  <string id="6147799">I want some pie.</string>
  <string id="6147802">Maker knows what'll happen when I'm gone. I try not to think about it.</string>
  <string id="6147803">Perhaps he'll be the first dwarven mage? Wouldn't that be interesting.</string>
  <string id="6147804">Dwarf magic?</string>
  <string id="6147805">I don't know... the actual mages don't do enchanting, do they? Just the ones who had their magic taken away.</string>
  <string id="6147808">Tranquil!</string>
  <string id="6147811">Yes, them. Shudders</string>
  <string id="6147812">I make enchantments.</string>
  <string id="6147816">Ooh... enchantment!</string>
  <string id="6147817">You like the shiny?</string>
  <string id="6147818">I saw something nasty in the woodshed!</string>
  <string id="6147819">I can make it for you!</string>
  <string id="6147843">It really wasn't your fault, you know.</string>
  <string id="6147846">Ma serannas, Junar. It feels like my fault, though.</string>
  <string id="6147847">Aneth ara.</string>
  <string id="6147850">What's the matter?</string>
  <string id="6147853">We can get more halla.</string>
  <string id="6147856">It won't be the same.</string>
  <string id="6147859">I heard you got a bear last night.</string>
  <string id="6147862">A small one.</string>
  <string id="6147865">There's no such thing as a small bear.</string>
  <string id="6147868">Fine, it was twenty feet tall and had teeth the size of Master Ilen's head.</string>
  <string id="6147871">Much better.</string>
  <string id="6147874">Of course you wouldn't admit to it.</string>
  <string id="6147879">Ser Alrik? Where did you get these? He was murdered in the Gallows not a few days ago!</string>
  <string id="6147882">He was trying to turn every mage in Kirkwall Tranquil!</string>
  <string id="6147885">What about his plan?</string>
  <string id="6147888">Ser Alrik made a suggestion, yes. But we turned him down.</string>
  <string id="6147891">The Rite of Tranquility has always been a last resort. It has saved lives, but it is not without its costs.</string>
  <string id="6147892">I dedicated your mother into the Chantry. She was a beautiful baby.</string>
  <string id="6147895">Your grandmother was a very proper lady, but she was beside herself that day.</string>
  <string id="6147898">And your mother put a fist in my eye.</string>
  <string id="6147899">I became a lay sister here when I was only a girl. My parents died of fever and I was taken in by the Chantry.</string>
  <string id="6147902">Eventually, I took my vows. After I had served for some time, the revered mothers agreed that I should travel to Orlais.</string>
  <string id="6147905">The Divine herself appointed me grand cleric of Kirkwall. That was near thirty years ago.</string>
  <string id="6147909">So I think a spring wedding would be lovely, don't you, Sister Colinda?</string>
  <string id="6147912">Is it true we're leaving without the Keeper?</string>
  <string id="6147915">I don't know. I hope not.</string>
  <string id="6147926">A storm is coming. I can smell it.</string>
  <string id="6147929">I got a thorn in the sole of my foot. Cursed hawthorns!</string>
  <string id="6147932">You should see the Keeper. That might get infected.</string>
  <string id="6147935">She'll just tell me to wear shoes again.</string>
  <string id="6147938">Shemlen. Wonderful. Make your business here quick.</string>
  <string id="6147941">It would be, I'm sure. But do you think it's wise to plan for a wedding when there isn't even a groom yet?</string>
  <string id="6147944">Details, details. I'll have you know my daughter has had a suitor come by the house twice now!</string>
  <string id="6147972">I don't hate you because you're a mage. I hate you because you won't shut up about it.</string>
  <string id="6147975">Oppression this, templars that. I'd heard enough long before you.</string>
  <string id="6148024">Maybe it's time you put some thought into it.</string>
  <string id="6148033">Did you approve my application?</string>
  <string id="6148036">I'm surprised you still travel with us, Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6148079">I hear you uncovered a conspiracy against Meredith from within the Order.</string>
  <string id="6148082">The mercy you showed was admirable.</string>
  <string id="6148083">I have never supported public hangings as a deterrence.</string>
  <string id="6148084">We have had to perform many funerals in the alienage.</string>
  <string id="6148087">Sadly, mages like Huon remind us all why they aren't free.</string>
  <string id="6148088">Your friend seems troubled. Please tell him the Maker can help.</string>
  <string id="6148089">The mages have kept their peace for a thousand years. Why does this fall to me?</string>
  <string id="6148090">You look concerned, Champion. Is there a problem?</string>
  <string id="6148091">I'm just seeking your benediction, Your Grace.</string>
  <string id="6148092">May I have your blessing?</string>
  <string id="6148093">May Andraste guide your hand to protect Kirkwall in its darkest hour.</string>
  <string id="6148094">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="6148095">No. No problem.</string>
  <string id="6148096">Andraste guide you.</string>
  <string id="6148101">Your support of the knight-commander has quieted the unrest in the city. For now.</string>
  <string id="6148104">Your support of the first enchanter has stirred some unrest in the city.</string>
  <string id="6148107">Thank you for diffusing the situation between the knight-commander and Orsino.</string>
  <string id="6148110">Those sorts of grievances are best not settled in public.</string>
  <string id="6148111">There must be a way to satisfy both sides.</string>
  <string id="6148112">How can we make peace?</string>
  <string id="6148113">I pray you are right.</string>
  <string id="6148116">Oh, come on. That wouldn't have been half as fun without an audience.</string>
  <string id="6148117">It's more dramatic that way.</string>
  <string id="6148118">If they had come to blows, this whole city might have erupted.</string>
  <string id="6148121">The only way this will end is when one of them kills the other.</string>
  <string id="6148122">There will be war.</string>
  <string id="6148123">I hope you're wrong.</string>
  <string id="6148126">I've been talking with them both. Orsino is not an unreasonable man.</string>
  <string id="6148129">Surely a compromise can be reached.</string>
  <string id="6148135">You look worried, child. Is something wrong?</string>
  <string id="6148136">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="6148137">Nothing's wrong.</string>
  <string id="6148138">Walk in the Maker's light.</string>
  <string id="6148141">You have my deepest condolences on your mother, child. I am truly sorry.</string>
  <string id="6148145">There is great unrest in the streets. I fear the Qunari are actively preaching against us.</string>
  <string id="6148146">The viscount is concerned that my sisters may be fanning the flames of hatred against the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6148150">I understand your desire to see the Qunari gone, but Mother Petrice's way was not the right one.</string>
  <string id="6148151">May the Maker have mercy on Mother Petrice.</string>
  <string id="6148152">My chantry has been drenched in blood. </string>
  <string id="6148153">The Maker would not set me a challenge greater than I can manage.</string>
  <string id="6148154">The Maker's time is not men's time. We do not need to rush.</string>
  <string id="6148157">The Chantry is not a domineering father with the whip always in hand.</string>
  <string id="6148160">Andraste guide your steps in this difficult time.</string>
  <string id="6148161">You disapprove of me. You think I should send the templars against the Qunari, perhaps? Destroy the mages or set them free?</string>
  <string id="6148164">There are many strong opinions in this city, child. It is not my place to decide who is right.</string>
  <string id="6148167">She is a gentle mother, who knows her children learn best when allowed to learn themselves.</string>
  <string id="6148175">Nice hound, Sister. More agreeable than most of your company.</string>
  <string id="6148184">Not at all, but Sandal isn't really my son.</string>
  <string id="6148187">I found him in the Deep Roads when I left Orzammar for good. Raised him as my own, though. Isn't that right, my boy?</string>
  <string id="6148190">I like Bodahn.</string>
  <string id="6148193">He's always been this way. Always collecting things and enchanting them. Strange, I suppose.</string>
  <string id="6148194">Have you ever thought of finding out more?</string>
  <string id="6148195">Why not look into it?</string>
  <string id="6148196">Well, I did. I brought him to the Circle of Magi about a year after we got to the surface.</string>
  <string id="6148199">They called him a savant, but then they started giving him the eye like they were going to keep him. So we left.</string>
  <string id="6148202">Not going to go back to those vultures. Sandal's happy as he is.</string>
  <string id="6148209">The old lady is scary.</string>
  <string id="6148212">There is no old lady, Sandal. How many times do I have to tell you that?</string>
  <string id="6148215">What's this about?</string>
  <string id="6148218">Oh, my boy sees things sometimes. Says he saw an old lady standing by his bed.</string>
  <string id="6148221">She has a scary laugh.</string>
  <string id="6148224">Yes, well. There you go.</string>
  <string id="6148227">It's very shiny.</string>
  <string id="6148228">I want to go home.</string>
  <string id="6148231">We can go back to Ferelden one day, my boy. I promise.</string>
  <string id="6148232">That big tower in the lake is scary.</string>
  <string id="6148235">He means the Gallows. And I quite agree.</string>
  <string id="6148236">Could I have some salamanders, please?</string>
  <string id="6148239">Don't do it. That's where the boom comes from, I think.</string>
  <string id="6148240">Your house is pretty.</string>
  <string id="6148307">There are still many refugees that need help. We all must do our part.</string>
  <string id="6148308">We're here to serve the Maker, messere. What are you here for?</string>
  <string id="6148326">A shemlen... will wonders never cease?</string>
  <string id="6148335">Arl Eamon</string>
  <string id="6148336">Arl Eamon</string>
  <string id="6148337">What happened?</string>
  <string id="6148338">Connor lives.</string>
  <string id="6148339">Connor Lives</string>
  <string id="6148350">Hmm. Perhaps if we put some flowers there, and some ribbon there... </string>
  <string id="6148354">I have little time for gratitude. Take this.</string>
  <string id="6148357">Quickly, everyone—run!</string>
  <string id="6148363">You fight good. I keep word. Half of bounty.</string>
  <string id="6148366">Fair journeys, friend.</string>
  <string id="6148372">Back to Denerim, apostates. Chanter's board wants you alive.</string>
  <string id="6148375">Come no closer, sellsword. I will not give up my kin.</string>
  <string id="6148378">Stranger, you help—we split bounty on mages. Coin enough for all.</string>
  <string id="6148381">Please, all we want is freedom!</string>
  <string id="6148382">If you can stay ahead of the templars and bounty hunters—what then?</string>
  <string id="6148383">What's your plan, elf?</string>
  <string id="6148384">We run. To Orlais. Rivain. Anywhere but here.</string>
  <string id="6148387">Someplace where the Circle isn't a prison.</string>
  <string id="6148388">Undisciplined mages are a danger to themselves and others. They should go to the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6148389">Mages need training.</string>
  <string id="6148390">And let the templars do to me what they did to Feynriel? I will not voluntarily don a hangman's noose.</string>
  <string id="6148393">Fight for your lives!</string>
  <string id="6148394">Half the reward? I can live with that.</string>
  <string id="6148395">We share the bounty, then.</string>
  <string id="6148396">We'll die before we go back to Kirkwall!</string>
  <string id="6148399">Maybe they still pay if they be dead, yes? Attack!</string>
  <string id="6148402">They've done nothing wrong. Let them pass.</string>
  <string id="6148403">Let the elves go.</string>
  <string id="6148404">You with them? Too bad for you.</string>
  <string id="6148407">Kill them all.</string>
  <string id="6148416">Maren, sit. I'll tell you the tale of Ghilan'nain.</string>
  <string id="6148419">Aneth ara, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6148422">Did anyone follow you here? More and more humans have been wandering up the mountain.</string>
  <string id="6148425">Please, just go. Leave me.</string>
  <string id="6148428">Maren, how is the clan?</string>
  <string id="6148431">Tense. I fear something terrible will happen if we don't move on soon.</string>
  <string id="6148432">We are not going to kill apostates for you!</string>
  <string id="6148441">Another time, Hahren.</string>
  <string id="6148450">What are you looking at?</string>
  <string id="6148455">I can't make you a guard, Carver.</string>
  <string id="6148458">We were both soldiers. Why won't they take me?</string>
  <string id="6148461">I was an officer. And I follow orders.</string>
  <string id="6148464">Laughs No you don't.</string>
  <string id="6148467">I also think of others before myself. You seem tired of that, and that's dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6148470">Just when it's not my choice. You told them not to take me, didn't you?</string>
  <string id="6148473">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6148476">Carver, don't.</string>
  <string id="6148479">You're ever so busy with the guardsmen. It must be a burden to slum with the refugees.</string>
  <string id="6148482">It's oddly comforting that you insult me like I'm family.</string>
  <string id="6148551">I know Merrill was fond of Mahariel, but it's been a year. That's not healthy.</string>
  <string id="6148552">Is it my imagination, or is Master Ilen's temper getting worse with time?</string>
  <string id="6148557">Aneth ara, human. If the Keeper wants you here, then be welcome.</string>
  <string id="6148600">Brooding over the loss of Mahariel is the least disturbing thing she's done.</string>
  <string id="6148615">Her own people? That's horrible!</string>
  <string id="6148618">Figures.</string>
  <string id="6148621">The Lost Patrol</string>
  <string id="6148623">Trust and leniency? Is that what you call it?</string>
  <string id="6148627">Find out what happened to a Qunari patrol that went missing along the Wounded Coast.</string>
  <string id="6148628">The Qunari was grudgingly pleased to discover what happened to the missing patrol.</string>
  <string id="6148629">The Qunari patrol was killed. Report this to the Qunari in the Lowtown Docks before nightfall.</string>
  <string id="6148631">Enchantment Apparatus</string>
  <string id="6148637">It's not that much worse.</string>
  <string id="6148640">You weren't here this morning when he threatened to hang Pol upside down from an aravel.</string>
  <string id="6148641">Is it true you're leaving?</string>
  <string id="6148644">I'll miss all of you.</string>
  <string id="6148647">Wherever you go, Merrill, go forward. Don't dwell on Mahariel anymore.</string>
  <string id="6148648">So this is it, then? You're leaving us?</string>
  <string id="6148651">We might see each other again, Chandan.</string>
  <string id="6148654">We all mourned Tamlen, Merrill. You don't have to mourn him forever.</string>
  <string id="6148655">Bodahn's Provisions</string>
  <string id="6148657">Bodahn's Provisions</string>
  <string id="6148660">Aneth ara, Maren.</string>
  <string id="6148663">How was the hunting today, Chandan?</string>
  <string id="6148666">Slow, I'm afraid. I saw three chipmunks the entire day.</string>
  <string id="6148667">Maren! I brought you something!</string>
  <string id="6148669">Why do you do this right in front of me?</string>
  <string id="6148672">It's the truth!</string>
  <string id="6148678">We're not all blood mages!</string>
  <string id="6148681">He deserves mercy. What happened wasn't his fault.</string>
  <string id="6148692">Were they at least cute chipmunks?</string>
  <string id="6148695">Not as cute as you.</string>
  <string id="6148699">You're very different from other elves.</string>
  <string id="6148702">Oh? You know them all?</string>
  <string id="6148705">No. I just... you look different. There's no denying that.</string>
  <string id="6148708">It is what I am. And unlike the problems you claim to have, I really did have no choice.</string>
  <string id="6148711">Do we know anyone who isn't brooding every hour of the day?</string>
  <string id="6148714">Like attracts like, it seems.</string>
  <string id="6148717">You know, Fenris, I have a tattoo.</string>
  <string id="6148720">You have a what?</string>
  <string id="6148723">A tattoo. A lot of us got them before Ostagar. It's a mabari. For strength.</string>
  <string id="6148726">Does it curse you with the ability to reach into a man and tear out his insides?</string>
  <string id="6148729">Uh. I can make it bark.</string>
  <string id="6148732">Please don't.</string>
  <string id="6148735">Seconded.</string>
  <string id="6148736">Agreed.</string>
  <string id="6148737">Yes. Refrain.</string>
  <string id="6148738">Rather see it wag.</string>
  <string id="6148739">That's... ew.</string>
  <string id="6148740">Sighs</string>
  <string id="6148743">So, Isabela. You captained a ship? That's a lot of men to handle. For you to command.</string>
  <string id="6148746">Well aren't you just adorable fumbling for a topic.</string>
  <string id="6148749">You say that like I'm harmless.</string>
  <string id="6148752">As harmless as a pup that will someday grow into its fangs and sink them deep.</string>
  <string id="6148755">Sure, keep teasing. I'll show you how much of a pup I am.</string>
  <string id="6148758">I know. That's why I do it.</string>
  <string id="6148761">I saw you at the Blooming Rose the other night.</string>
  <string id="6148775">Oh really?</string>
  <string id="6148778">I picked them while I was hunting. Not a lot of game. Plenty of wildflowers.</string>
  <string id="6148781">That's very sweet, Chandan.</string>
  <string id="6148793">Something wrong, Pol?</string>
  <string id="6148796">I need advice.</string>
  <string id="6148799">I'll help if I can.</string>
  <string id="6148802">How in Mythal's name did you court Ineria?</string>
  <string id="6148805">Still having trouble winning Maren? Harshal, that girl might as well live on the moon. Just find someone else.</string>
  <string id="6148808">You could say that. I think Master Ilen is going to murder me.</string>
  <string id="6148811">Because of the ironwood? Have you thought about going to the Keeper and begging for amnesty?</string>
  <string id="6148824">This mountain is cursed, I swear. Three days in a row I've shot at and missed deer.</string>
  <string id="6148828">Shit. I... know what this looks like, but I didn't hurt her!</string>
  <string id="6148829">Let her go, and we can talk.</string>
  <string id="6148830">Release her.</string>
  <string id="6148831">If I let her go, you'll kill me!</string>
  <string id="6148834">So the wild-eyed hysteria is just for show then?</string>
  <string id="6148835">You didn't?</string>
  <string id="6148837">Do you take me for a fool?</string>
  <string id="6148838">You expect me to believe that?</string>
  <string id="6148839">Several years ago, my sister was murdered. The bastard's now in Kirkwall, killing again. The same way he killed my sister.</string>
  <string id="6148843">Pol, if you want to make yourself useful, go talk to Chandan.</string>
  <string id="6148845">You and Fenarel are the only hunters bringing back anything worth skinning lately.</string>
  <string id="6148848">Maybe it's not the mountain. Maybe it's just you that's cursed, my love.</string>
  <string id="6148851">You always know just what to say to put my mind at ease.</string>
  <string id="6148854">Well, I'm half convinced that Fenarel cheats.</string>
  <string id="6148857">I don't care if he does, as long as he teaches me to do it, too.</string>
  <string id="6148858">You don't understand. Someone is after her. I had to keep her safe!</string>
  <string id="6148872">For pity's sake, he's not trying to write poetry again, is he?</string>
  <string id="6148875">You could save us all from a horrible, horrible fate, lethallin.</string>
  <string id="6148881">Uh... andaran atish'an, stranger.</string>
  <string id="6148899">Look at this! A target.</string>
  <string id="6148924">Pol, are... you busy?</string>
  <string id="6148927">No, of course not. Not too busy for you.</string>
  <string id="6148930">I thought maybe you could use some archery lessons. Private ones.</string>
  <string id="6148933">I think my aim is hopeless, Radha.</string>
  <string id="6148940">Well, why don't we go somewhere alone and try to fix that?</string>
  <string id="6148943">Oh! Ah... that's a great idea. My gear is on the other side of—</string>
  <string id="6148946">Leave it. You won't need it.</string>
  <string id="6148949">I took her so he'd have to come to me. I was finally going to face my sister's killer, but then you showed up...</string>
  <string id="6148956">You have taken on a heavy burden, Hawke. May the Creators watch over you.</string>
  <string id="6148960">I sent the elven girl to the chantry. They can help her, I'm sure of it.</string>
  <string id="6148961">Sighs An elven slave? Maker's breath, I hope you know what you're doing.</string>
  <string id="6148974">I don't know why you sent Orana to me.</string>
  <string id="6148977">Even so, I gave her what little I had. Enough to put her on a ship to Ferelden and maybe carry her for a while.</string>
  <string id="6148980">After that she's on her own. I don't expect she'll do well.</string>
  <string id="6149008">Greetings, Master.</string>
  <string id="6149011">Greetings, Mistress.</string>
  <string id="6149014">Your home was difficult to find. I've never been out on my own before. But... I found it. Many people know of you.</string>
  <string id="6149017">I hope I've made myself useful. I've already begun cleaning, and I can cook... not as good as papa, but a little.</string>
  <string id="6149020">Is there... anything else you'd like me to do?</string>
  <string id="6149021">What sort of skills do you have?</string>
  <string id="6149022">What else can you do?</string>
  <string id="6149023">Not many, I fear.</string>
  <string id="6149026">The magister bade me to clean, and sometimes fetch... but papa told me to keep out of her sight much as I could.</string>
  <string id="6149029">But I can learn! I'll serve you well! Please don't hurt me.</string>
  <string id="6149030">You've been through a great deal. How are you feeling?</string>
  <string id="6149031">Are you all right?</string>
  <string id="6149032">I miss papa, the other servants. I... try not to think about what happened.</string>
  <string id="6149035">I even feel sorry for the magister. Is that bad?</string>
  <string id="6149036">Hadriana killed your father—for his blood! Why would you feel sorry for her?</string>
  <string id="6149037">She was evil.</string>
  <string id="6149038">She tried so hard! It was very difficult for her, trying to prove herself.</string>
  <string id="6149041">The other magisters laughed at her. I saw how it tore at her soul.</string>
  <string id="6149044">People don't think that slaves watch, but we do. I know what she did, but... I still ache that she's gone.</string>
  <string id="6149047">You served her a long time. I understand.</string>
  <string id="6149048">No, it's not bad.</string>
  <string id="6149049">I'm sure Hadriana was very thankful for such loyalty.</string>
  <string id="6149050">She wouldn't think so.</string>
  <string id="6149051">I... suppose she was.</string>
  <string id="6149054">I'll serve you just as well, Master, you'll see.</string>
  <string id="6149055">I'll serve you just as well, Mistress, you'll see.</string>
  <string id="6149056">If you're staying here, Orana, it will be as my servant.</string>
  <string id="6149057">I'm going to pay you.</string>
  <string id="6149058">You mean... I won't be a slave anymore?</string>
  <string id="6149061">You'll be paid, like anyone else.</string>
  <string id="6149064">I... a slave is all I've ever been, like papa and grandpapa before me.</string>
  <string id="6149067">I'll try to be a good servant. Thank you, Master. You're too good to me.</string>
  <string id="6149070">I'll try to be a good servant. Thank you, Mistress. You're too good to me.</string>
  <string id="6149073">It's a big mansion. It'll need lots of cleaning.</string>
  <string id="6149074">You're doing fine.</string>
  <string id="6149075">Just do as I ask, Orana.</string>
  <string id="6149076">Do whatever I tell you.</string>
  <string id="6149077">Of course, Master. I'll do my very best.</string>
  <string id="6149078">Of course, Mistress. I'll do my very best.</string>
  <string id="6149081">You can't stay, Orana.</string>
  <string id="6149082">I can't keep you here.</string>
  <string id="6149083">I have to leave? But... where will I go?</string>
  <string id="6149084">Speak to my mother. She might be able to find you a position somewhere.</string>
  <string id="6149085">Talk to my mother.</string>
  <string id="6149086">Really? She would do that for me?</string>
  <string id="6149089">Of course.</string>
  <string id="6149092">The elf who was with me—he's an escaped slave, too. He can help you.</string>
  <string id="6149093">Talk to Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6149094">Would he do that?</string>
  <string id="6149097">You could ask him.</string>
  <string id="6149100">Then... I'm free?</string>
  <string id="6149103">Part of being free means deciding for yourself.</string>
  <string id="6149104">You're free.</string>
  <string id="6149105">Oh.</string>
  <string id="6149108">Thank you. I'll try my best to make you proud.</string>
  <string id="6149111">This might help you get started here in the city.</string>
  <string id="6149112">Take this coin.</string>
  <string id="6149113">Oh! You're... giving this to me?</string>
  <string id="6149116">Thank you so much. I'll... try my best to be free.</string>
  <string id="6149122">I'm sorry about your mama. I will miss her.</string>
  <string id="6149123">I've been keeping everything clean.</string>
  <string id="6149124">One day, I'll see papa again.</string>
  <string id="6149125">This place isn't like home at all. Minrathous was so noisy!</string>
  <string id="6149126">The hound you have... he watches me all the time. The magister never had hounds.</string>
  <string id="6149127">I hope all is well, Master.</string>
  <string id="6149128">I hope all is well, Mistress.</string>
  <string id="6149153">She'll go straight to the city guard. They'll ruin everything.</string>
  <string id="6149154">Can't you just tell the city guard what you told me?</string>
  <string id="6149155">You're afraid of the guards?</string>
  <string id="6149156">Why? I don't want him arrested. This isn't about justice, I need to be the one to bleed him dry.</string>
  <string id="6149159">Besides, they probably wouldn't even hear me out.</string>
  <string id="6149160">I can help you track down your sister's killer.</string>
  <string id="6149161">Let me help.</string>
  <string id="6149166">That wasn't... no, I didn't mean that.</string>
  <string id="6149169">I know. But you should be glad that's how I took it.</string>
  <string id="6149172">What? No you didn't.</string>
  <string id="6149175">I suppose someone else stole your chin to romance Faith.</string>
  <string id="6149178">Scoffs That's unlikely. She wasn't even working.</string>
  <string id="6149181">Mm-hmm. Got you.</string>
  <string id="6149184">Carver!</string>
  <string id="6149187">Oh ho! Nicely done.</string>
  <string id="6149190">I don't get it.</string>
  <string id="6149193">Carver, what would Mother say?</string>
  <string id="6149196">You're just... that's not what I... shit!</string>
  <string id="6149199">So, you're not like a lot of other girls.</string>
  <string id="6149202">No, I'm an elf.</string>
  <string id="6149205">Right. All right then.</string>
  <string id="6149208">Oh! Did I miss something dirty?</string>
  <string id="6149211">What? No! It wasn't dirty. It wasn't anything.</string>
  <string id="6149214">Oh. Right.</string>
  <string id="6149217">Because I miss a lot of dirty things and sometimes I wouldn't mind hearing them. Laughs</string>
  <string id="6149220">Would you now?</string>
  <string id="6149223">Your people came a long way, Merrill, but I'd like to think we have Ferelden in common.</string>
  <string id="6149226">I never saw Lothering. Did you walk as much as we did? Probably more, you didn't start with halla. Our ship stunk.</string>
  <string id="6149229">Your ship?</string>
  <string id="6149232">There was something foul in the hold. I can still smell it.</string>
  <string id="6149235">Oh. Well, that must have been unpleasant.</string>
  <string id="6149238">It was.</string>
  <string id="6149241">Did I miss another dirty thing?</string>
  <string id="6149244">No!</string>
  <string id="6149247">Varric.</string>
  <string id="6149250">Stop looking at me.</string>
  <string id="6149251">I'm headed to Darktown. If you learn anything new about the killer, find me there.</string>
  <string id="6149254">I've a score to settle with him.</string>
  <string id="6149256">I don't believe you.</string>
  <string id="6149258">He'll want to know what happened here.</string>
  <string id="6149259">I need to tell him about this.</string>
  <string id="6149260">Tell him whatever you like. I'll be long gone by then.</string>
  <string id="6149261">You really did make yourself a target, though. Kidnapping people and all.</string>
  <string id="6149262">You can't blame Emeric.</string>
  <string id="6149263">I suppose that's fair.</string>
  <string id="6149264">It did seem like Emeric was jumping to conclusions.</string>
  <string id="6149265">He's incompetent.</string>
  <string id="6149266">He's dedicated. I'll give him that.</string>
  <string id="6149267">No, I can manage on my own.</string>
  <string id="6149276">Hawke? Good timing. I was about to send you a message.</string>
  <string id="6149279">That can't be good.</string>
  <string id="6149280">What for?</string>
  <string id="6149281">Do you need my help again, Emeric?</string>
  <string id="6149282">You're Hawke, aren't you? You're the one who's been making waves around Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6149288">Carver.</string>
  <string id="6149291">Still think you're helping while burying us in debt to your brother?</string>
  <string id="6149294">Still riding side-saddle while bitching at your betters?</string>
  <string id="6149297">Drinks later?</string>
  <string id="6149300">Never miss 'em.</string>
  <string id="6149303">What's your issue now, little Hawke?</string>
  <string id="6149306">Don't call... just don't, all right? You're looking for fodder for your stories.</string>
  <string id="6149309">You think you're that interesting?</string>
  <string id="6149312">I have enough trouble being overshadowed as it is.</string>
  <string id="6149315">I don't need to get caught under an imaginary me, too.</string>
  <string id="6149318">Don't you worry. I'm not in the business of lullabies or children's stories.</string>
  <string id="6149321">And the city guard, well... they rejected my evidence and dismissed the murders as isolated incidents. They don't care either.</string>
  <string id="6149324">I've seen your evidence—scattered notes, conjecture, nothing remotely usable.</string>
  <string id="6149327">You can't expect us to act on your hunches alone. Look what happened when we did.</string>
  <string id="6149328">Women are dying out there, and no one's doing anything.</string>
  <string id="6149333">I was wondering if you had some time to help an old man out.</string>
  <string id="6149336">The guards who searched Gascard's place were incompetent. They didn't know what they were looking for.</string>
  <string id="6149339">Fine, if you insist.</string>
  <string id="6149340">It should be investigated, at least.</string>
  <string id="6149341">Maybe you're right.</string>
  <string id="6149342">Thank you. I've faced nothing but ridicule. To hear someone say that is... encouraging.</string>
  <string id="6149343">It cannot be a coincidence? It sounds exactly like a coincidence!</string>
  <string id="6149344">Or it could be.</string>
  <string id="6149345">Gascard DuPuis is hiding something! I'm convinced of it.</string>
  <string id="6149346">You're seeing connections where none exist.</string>
  <string id="6149347">You're jumping to conclusions.</string>
  <string id="6149349">Because you saw the sack of bones. You found Ninette's hand. You can't tell me there's nothing to this.</string>
  <string id="6149353">What if one of the women who died was someone you loved?</string>
  <string id="6149358">If Gascard DuPuis is guilty, he must be stopped before he kills again.</string>
  <string id="6149361">Sighs Then we will investigate DuPuis, if only to put this to rest.</string>
  <string id="6149364">If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong. At least I'll know for sure.</string>
  <string id="6149365">We should help him. No one else will.</string>
  <string id="6149366">We have to try.</string>
  <string id="6149367">If it means that much to you, I'll help.</string>
  <string id="6149368">I'll do it.</string>
  <string id="6149369">Why is it always Hawke to the rescue?</string>
  <string id="6149370">Why me?</string>
  <string id="6149371">I can't really answer that.</string>
  <string id="6149374">I'm not making any promises.</string>
  <string id="6149375">Don't get your hopes up.</string>
  <string id="6149376">I'll take whatever help I can get.</string>
  <string id="6149379">What do you need?</string>
  <string id="6149380">Of course.</string>
  <string id="6149381">Depends on what the old man's asking.</string>
  <string id="6149382">Maybe.</string>
  <string id="6149383">Perhaps you should hear what I have to say before you make a decision.</string>
  <string id="6149388">No, it really isn't.</string>
  <string id="6149395">Yes, unfortunately.</string>
  <string id="6149398">Well, I don't know. Emeric's been acting strangely for months. It's probably just a misunderstanding.</string>
  <string id="6149400">Oh, Maker. The murders. Emeric was right. He was getting too close.</string>
  <string id="6149406">Enchantment!</string>
  <string id="6149409">No, Leandra! Lee. Ann. Drah! </string>
  <string id="6149412">Shouting won't make him understand you better, you know.</string>
  <string id="6149415">What's all the yelling about?</string>
  <string id="6149418">What's wrong, Uncle?</string>
  <string id="6149421">There you are!</string>
  <string id="6149424">Where's your mother? Is she feeling all right?</string>
  <string id="6149425">I'm sure she's all right. Why are you so upset?</string>
  <string id="6149426">Why wouldn't she be?</string>
  <string id="6149427">I'm tempted to say she isn't, just to see your reaction.</string>
  <string id="6149428">I could say no.</string>
  <string id="6149432">How should I know? I just got home.</string>
  <string id="6149433">Why are you asking me?</string>
  <string id="6149434">Your mother didn't show up for our weekly visit. Is she ill? She is here, isn't she?</string>
  <string id="6149437">No, Gamlen. We haven't seen her all day.</string>
  <string id="6149440">Where could she be?</string>
  <string id="6149443">With her suitor, perhaps?</string>
  <string id="6149446">Suitor? Leandra never mentioned a suitor.</string>
  <string id="6149449">Well, those lilies arrived for her this morning.</string>
  <string id="6149450">White lilies. I know something about that.</string>
  <string id="6149451">Wait. That sounds familiar.</string>
  <string id="6149452">No. You're wrong. Leandra is fine.</string>
  <string id="6149453">Aveline will get the city guard to keep an eye out. Don't worry, Uncle.</string>
  <string id="6149454">Aveline will take care of it.</string>
  <string id="6149455">Maybe... maybe Leandra took another path to my house. I could've just missed her. I'm going back to Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6149461">You see, Uncle? Nothing to worry about. Mother's just got a special friend. </string>
  <string id="6149462">I suppose it is a suitor then.</string>
  <string id="6149463">No. This isn't like Leandra at all. If she was going to cancel our visit, she would've sent a message.</string>
  <string id="6149466">Do you think I could have just missed her? I know the route she takes from your house to mine.</string>
  <string id="6149469">I'll see if someone's seen her along the way.</string>
  <string id="6149470">Aveline will tell the city guard to keep an eye out for Mother.</string>
  <string id="6149471">I'll talk to Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6149472">Right. That's a good idea. I'm going to see if I can find her myself.</string>
  <string id="6149475">I'll be really glad if I have to punch you for getting me this upset over nothing.</string>
  <string id="6149476">I hope you find her.</string>
  <string id="6149480">You're panicking over nothing. She'll be back soon.</string>
  <string id="6149481">This is silly.</string>
  <string id="6149482">I can't just sit here. I have to do something.</string>
  <string id="6149488">You should help Gamlen look for your mother. You might be able to track her more easily once night falls and the streets empty out.</string>
  <string id="6149492">Do you know who did it?</string>
  <string id="6149493">I'm still looking into it.</string>
  <string id="6149494">Not yet.</string>
  <string id="6149495">I know who the murderer is.</string>
  <string id="6149496">I have an answer.</string>
  <string id="6149497">A right mess, this is.</string>
  <string id="6149501">Danvil's murder is a tragedy, of course, but one of the suspects is a Qunari. If we don't solve this fast, it could set the town aflame.</string>
  <string id="6149504">They say the Arishok respects you, and your neighbors speak well of you. People will have faith if you're looking into this.</string>
  <string id="6149505">I'll leave this to the professionals.</string>
  <string id="6149506">You should handle it.</string>
  <string id="6149507">Understood.</string>
  <string id="6149510">All right, what would you have me do?</string>
  <string id="6149511">How do I do this?</string>
  <string id="6149512">We interviewed the bystanders. We've got three suspects that were nearby.</string>
  <string id="6149515">Devrona is a companion of the well-to-do. Ser Bofort Laurie is the deceased's brother.</string>
  <string id="6149518">And Smart Tate is hired muscle. Also, the Qunari was here earlier. But as far as I know, he wasn't even in Hightown when Danvil was killed.</string>
  <string id="6149521">The murder happened over there. Here's all the notes we have.</string>
  <string id="6149524">If you figure out who did it, let me know!</string>
  <string id="6149548">I got it all figured out. There was no Blight!</string>
  <string id="6149551">And that's a fact, is it?</string>
  <string id="6149554">Think about it! Why would it start in Ferelden? A dirty backwater full of dogs and the occasional sheep?</string>
  <string id="6149557">It took decades for the other Blights to run their courses. This one? Less than two years. Don't you see?</string>
  <string id="6149560">It never happened! It was all a Fereldan ploy!</string>
  <string id="6149566">That man over there. He's been staring at me for an entire hour. I counted.</string>
  <string id="6149569">Maybe he likes you.</string>
  <string id="6149572">No. He knows. He knows that I know. But what he doesn't know is that I know that he knows that I know.</string>
  <string id="6149575">How do you know that he doesn't know that you know that he knows that you know, you know?</string>
  <string id="6149578">What?</string>
  <string id="6149581">Exactly.</string>
  <string id="6149584">I learned that the king of Ferelden loves cheese. He's one of us. Another of Andraste's chosen.</string>
  <string id="6149585">Do you ever feel like you're part of a story that someone's telling?</string>
  <string id="6149588">Maker, I wish whoever was telling the story had made me more handsome.</string>
  <string id="6149589">My mother used to say there are a lot more mages now than when she was a child.</string>
  <string id="6149592">I think it's the lyrium in the water.</string>
  <string id="6149593">The truth is out there.</string>
  <string id="6149600">Hawke!</string>
  <string id="6149606">We used to have another bartender here, you know.</string>
  <string id="6149609">Oh?</string>
  <string id="6149612">He went into the back room for another keg of ale one day and never returned.</string>
  <string id="6149615">So you be careful going back there.</string>
  <string id="6149618">I promise! If I go back there, I won't be alone.</string>
  <string id="6149627">Liam the harbormaster was in the raiders' pockets! And he seemed like such an honest man. Grumpy, but honest.</string>
  <string id="6149628">Some folk are smuggling mages out of Kirkwall. I hear the freed mages congregate in the mountains to plot Kirkwall's downfall.</string>
  <string id="6149629">Someone stole the Qunari formula for explosive powder. Soon, we'll have the same weapons they do.</string>
  <string id="6149630">Harlan's thinking of changing the name of the Blooming Rose to Harlan's Harlots.</string>
  <string id="6149631">The Qunari have been here for years. People are getting really nervous about that. I just know they're going to attack soon.</string>
  <string id="6149632">There's been a bunch of elves camped out on Sundermount for ages. People say they're starting a settlement.</string>
  <string id="6149635">Can they do that? The land doesn't belong to them.</string>
  <string id="6149636">Watch out for pirates and raiders, if you plan to travel by sea. The coast around the Free Marches is swarming with them.</string>
  <string id="6149641">People are real tense about the mages and templars. If they go to war, Kirkwall will be squashed in between.</string>
  <string id="6149642">The Divine in Orlais is getting old. She better pick a successor soon, or it'll be a glorious mess when she dies.</string>
  <string id="6149643">Bless Elthina's heart. She's the only thing keeping Meredith from tearing Orsino apart.</string>
  <string id="6149644">There was a templar in here yesterday. Says Meredith's been spending more and more time alone in her office.</string>
  <string id="6149647">And if you walk by, it sounds like she's talking to herself. Strange, huh?</string>
  <string id="6149648">Some Qunari stragglers are lurking about outside the town. I hope someone does something about them.</string>
  <string id="6149649">No one knows when we'll get a new viscount. Couple nobles tried to claim the title, but Meredith shot them down.</string>
  <string id="6149652">Meh. I have people.</string>
  <string id="6149655">Wait... did you say people? Or peephole?</string>
  <string id="6149658">I assumed you were exaggerating.</string>
  <string id="6149661">You'd think so, right? But... not so much.</string>
  <string id="6149665">You've been nursing that empty mug for hours. Get another drink, or get out.</string>
  <string id="6149668">Be off with you. I'll do what I please.</string>
  <string id="6149678">I saw Meredith the other day. Scary.</string>
  <string id="6149679">That dwarf Varric told me you're from Ferelden, and you escaped the Blight on the back of a giant turtle!</string>
  <string id="6149682">Wow.</string>
  <string id="6149685">I'm distantly related to Viscount Dumar. My aunt's second husband's fourth, uh, eldest daughter once cleaned the viscount's privy.</string>
  <string id="6149690">Why is this place called the Hanged Man?</string>
  <string id="6149693">Because everytime someone asks a stupid question, we string them up from the rafters.</string>
  <string id="6149704">I hear Meredith makes blankets from the hair of dead mages, to keep her warm in winter.</string>
  <string id="6149705">You tried to help a friend. Surely no harm can come of that.</string>
  <string id="6149708">I wish I still had your innocence. There was too much hatred in me. Justice thought he would overcome that.</string>
  <string id="6149739">Did you hear about the gruesome laboratory the guard discovered under a Lowtown foundry?</string>
  <string id="6149742">Body parts everywhere. They had to burn the place to get rid of the stench.</string>
  <string id="6149745">Those Qunari are still waiting for a ship. Can you believe it? What's it been now, four years?</string>
  <string id="6149748">At least.</string>
  <string id="6149751">They're either lying about wanting to leave or they have very, very slow boats.</string>
  <string id="6149754">I bet the templars could get rid of the Qunari if they really wanted to.</string>
  <string id="6149757">Why don't they, then?</string>
  <string id="6149760">Meredith doesn't want to lose men, you see. I hear she believes the mages are out of control.</string>
  <string id="6149763">If all the templars get killed fighting Qunari, who's going to watch over the mages?</string>
  <string id="6149769">This ale isn't as good as it used to be.</string>
  <string id="6149772">It was never good.</string>
  <string id="6149775">Oh. Well, maybe I'm not as drunk as I used to be, then.</string>
  <string id="6149781">Did you hear about what happened on Sundermount? The Champion killed every elf there!</string>
  <string id="6149784">I hear the ground cracked open and swallowed them whole.</string>
  <string id="6149787">Knight-Commander Meredith's gone a bit mad. I hear she sees enemies everywhere, these days.</string>
  <string id="6149790">Nonsense. Meredith's the best thing that's ever happened to this city. She keeps us safe.</string>
  <string id="6149793">I hear the Champion of Kirkwall's killed a dozen dragons and sleeps on a bed made from their bones.</string>
  <string id="6149796">And I hear she uses the Arishok's skull as a gravy boat.</string>
  <string id="6149799">And I hear he uses the Arishok's skull as a gravy boat.</string>
  <string id="6149802">You really believe everything you hear, don't you?</string>
  <string id="6149823">This is what Mother was protecting me from.</string>
  <string id="6149840">We would never turn someone over to the templars, Mistress. Never.</string>
  <string id="6149850">You spend a lot of time here, don't you?</string>
  <string id="6149851">Varric told me you found a pair of magical pantaloons in the Deep Roads. They glow when darkspawn are near.</string>
  <string id="6149855">Nice to see the Champion of Kirkwall isn't too proud to come to the Hanged Man.</string>
  <string id="6149856">How do you think Meredith keeps her skin so clear? Is it magic? I bet it's magic, isn't it? What a hypocrite.</string>
  <string id="6149860">I feel sorry for the mages sometimes, you know? What a terrible thing, to be used by everyone.</string>
  <string id="6149861">I wish some rich man would marry me and take me away from here. But this tavern's the worst place to meet men.</string>
  <string id="6149862">Did you really take on a dragon while naked, wielding nothing but a wooden spoon? Varric says you did.</string>
  <string id="6149863">I hate my job. I've been here years and all I've got to show for it is a sore back and blisters on my feet.</string>
  <string id="6149865">You should hear the stories Varric's telling about you. That man has a tongue of silver, I swear.</string>
  <string id="6149866">Who was it?</string>
  <string id="6149867">It was the prostitute.</string>
  <string id="6149868">Devrona.</string>
  <string id="6149869">It was Danvil's brother.</string>
  <string id="6149870">Ser Bofort Laurie</string>
  <string id="6149871">It was the thug.</string>
  <string id="6149872">Smart Tate.</string>
  <string id="6149873">It was the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6149874">The Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6149875">Why couldn't it be Devrona?</string>
  <string id="6149876">The murder weapon was a short sword. She had nowhere to hide it.</string>
  <string id="6149877">The sword wasn't hers.</string>
  <string id="6149878">The murderer left a bloody footprint. It was too big to be hers.</string>
  <string id="6149879">The footprint wasn't right.</string>
  <string id="6149880">The victim was holding a bit of the murderer's clothing. It probably wasn't hers.</string>
  <string id="6149881">The cloth doesn't match.</string>
  <string id="6149882">The victim's coin pouch wasn't stolen. Devrona probably would've taken it.</string>
  <string id="6149883">Danvil still had his purse.</string>
  <string id="6149884">Ser Bofort and Ser Danvil were arguing before. You sure he didn't do it?</string>
  <string id="6149885">I don't think the murder weapon belonged to Bofort.</string>
  <string id="6149886">The sword wasn't his.</string>
  <string id="6149887">I don't think the bloody footprint matches Bofort's boot.</string>
  <string id="6149888">The footprint doesn't match.</string>
  <string id="6149889">The cloth in the victim's hand probably belongs to someone else.</string>
  <string id="6149890">The scrap of cloth doesn't match.</string>
  <string id="6149891">Bofort probably would've taken his brother's coin purse to make it look like a mugging.</string>
  <string id="6149892">Danvil still had his purse.</string>
  <string id="6149893">Smart Tate has been accused of murder before. You certain he's clean?</string>
  <string id="6149894">The murder weapon looks too fine for a thug.</string>
  <string id="6149895">The sword isn't his.</string>
  <string id="6149896">The bloody footprint doesn't seem like it belongs to him.</string>
  <string id="6149897">The footprint doesn't match.</string>
  <string id="6149898">The victim tore some cloth from the murderer. Tate's in leather armor—nothing to rip.</string>
  <string id="6149899">The scrap of cloth doesn't match.</string>
  <string id="6149900">A thug like Tate would've taken the coin purse, right?</string>
  <string id="6149901">Danvil still had his purse.</string>
  <string id="6149902">How can you be sure the Qunari isn't guilty?</string>
  <string id="6149903">The murder weapon isn't a Qunari blade.</string>
  <string id="6149904">The sword wasn't his.</string>
  <string id="6149905">The murderer's footprint looks human.</string>
  <string id="6149906">The footprint doesn't match.</string>
  <string id="6149907">The victim tore some cloth from the murderer. Qunari wear nothing like that.</string>
  <string id="6149908">The scrap of cloth doesn't match.</string>
  <string id="6149909">The Qunari probably would've taken Danvil's coin.</string>
  <string id="6149910">Danvil still had his purse.</string>
  <string id="6149911">Someone would've noticed a Qunari fleeing the area. They stand out.</string>
  <string id="6149912">No one saw him.</string>
  <string id="6149913">Makes sense to me.</string>
  <string id="6149916">Trying to take a Qunari from their compound is beyond my authority, though. I'll have this passed up to the viscount.</string>
  <string id="6149919">Men, let the others go. We'll bring the case to the magistrate.</string>
  <string id="6149922">We'll let you know how it turns out.</string>
  <string id="6149933">And here I was just about to like you!</string>
  <string id="6149958">I pity any mage who is forced to rely on you for protection.</string>
  <string id="6149961">You abandoned him?</string>
  <string id="6149978">Then who sent the creature?</string>
  <string id="6149981">I will speak to the city guard about this. Gascard DuPuis will not escape.</string>
  <string id="6149984">My men will cooperate however they can. Tell them I command it.</string>
  <string id="6149987">Thank you, Captain.</string>
  <string id="6149990">Whoever did this is a dangerous apostate that Meredith will want found. I will see to it personally.</string>
  <string id="6149991">Thank you for your help in this matter. If you learn anything more, please come to me.</string>
  <string id="6150004">What is this place?</string>
  <string id="6150007">This is the vault. The dwarves would have brought their...</string>
  <string id="6150013">Oh, that can't be good.</string>
  <string id="6150028">Orana</string>
  <string id="6150039">I'm desperately trying to stay away. But the giggling... and the perfume... and those revealing dresses!</string>
  <string id="6150040">Maker, give me strength.</string>
  <string id="6150059">I see Torelin is back again to set up a wedding for that daughter of hers.</string>
  <string id="6150062">Which chases off suitors faster? An overbearing mother or a duck-faced daughter? Laughs</string>
  <string id="6150068">Donations to the Chantry are always welcome, messere.</string>
  <string id="6150069">I had never thought about the plight of mages among the Qunari. But it seems they are even more oppressed than we are.</string>
  <string id="6150072">We must help this poor creature. He has faced worse than what I run from.</string>
  <string id="6150075">You cannot mean to turn your back on this creature's suffering?</string>
  <string id="6150078">It would draw notice in all the wrong places. Still, it's hard to walk away from this.</string>
  <string id="6150087">Has Torelin had much luck finding a good husband for her daughter?</string>
  <string id="6150090">A good husband? At this point I'm sure Torelin would be happy with any husband!</string>
  <string id="6150096">We welcome any donations you can spare, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6150137">I've had quite enough of people coddling Sister Alema. So she's sick. We all get sick.</string>
  <string id="6150140">Oh, I know. She hasn't even left her chambers for a week.</string>
  <string id="6150143">And she's getting all her meals delivered to her. How lazy can that woman be?</string>
  <string id="6150159">Of all the ridiculous, spineless, mind-controlled, senseless piece of shit arguments I've ever heard!</string>
  <string id="6150162">What comfort has freedom brought you, mage? You would have more if you submitted to the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6150170">Poor Sister Alema. Her heart finally gave out.</string>
  <string id="6150173">She was so independent. If only she would have let us help her more, maybe she'd still be here.</string>
  <string id="6150176">She was so sweet. I can't say one bad thing about her.</string>
  <string id="6150180">Oh! The Champion! Good to see you again!</string>
  <string id="6150183">I was just telling Sister Lorena here about the wonderful work you've done for Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6150186">Laying it on a little thick, aren't we Sister Samea?</string>
  <string id="6150198">I'm not sure if it was right to hand that woman over to the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6150201">Who knows what those heathen monsters could be doing to her right now.</string>
  <string id="6150202">You've done a great service to this city by defeating the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6150203">Greetings, Champion. May the Maker smile upon you.</string>
  <string id="6150216">You must understand, Sister Colinda: I want grandchildren! Jatia is my only child, and she's not getting any prettier!</string>
  <string id="6150219">You must be patient, my dear. I'm sure Jatia has a wonderful personality.</string>
  <string id="6150222">What man cares about personality?</string>
  <string id="6150228">The Champion himself! Hmm, I wonder if he's still looking for a wife.</string>
  <string id="6150229">The Champion herself. I hear she isn't married yet, either. Maybe there's still hope for Jatia.</string>
  <string id="6150247">He seemed a good man, for a templar. I'm sure he's found peace.</string>
  <string id="6150250">Thank goodness.</string>
  <string id="6150262">I had hoped to find you. Unlike the rest of the bas filth in this city, the Arishok considered you basalit-an.</string>
  <string id="6150265">Many Qunari fell in Kirkwall when we departed. I am sent to gather their swords.</string>
  <string id="6150268">If you find a Qunari sword, return it to me.</string>
  <string id="6150269">What do I get if bring one to you?</string>
  <string id="6150270">Is there a reward?</string>
  <string id="6150271">It is reward enough to complete a worthy task. But if you crave gold, that can be arranged.</string>
  <string id="6150272">Don't you want their bodies, too?</string>
  <string id="6150273">Just their weapons?</string>
  <string id="6150274">Their husks serve no purpose. The weapons shall satisfy a demand of the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6150275">I'll keep an eye out.</string>
  <string id="6150276">I'll look for them.</string>
  <string id="6150277">You will find me here.</string>
  <string id="6150280">I'm pretty occupied right now.</string>
  <string id="6150281">I'm busy.</string>
  <string id="6150294">It's definitely magic. And not the good kind.</string>
  <string id="6150305">Qunari</string>
  <string id="6150307">My guardsmen will find Alessa, the woman who was with Gascard. She might still be in danger.</string>
  <string id="6150321">Have you located any Qunari blades?</string>
  <string id="6150322">This is what I've found.</string>
  <string id="6150323">Here you go.</string>
  <string id="6150324">My task is complete.</string>
  <string id="6150327">Your part in this will be noted.</string>
  <string id="6150328">If you were Qunari, you would be Ben-Hassrath. I give you this weapon—it is worthy of that role.</string>
  <string id="6150331">This weapon is you. Guard it or lose all honor.</string>
  <string id="6150334">If you find more, bring them to me.</string>
  <string id="6150335">Do you require gold for this task?</string>
  <string id="6150336">It's customary.</string>
  <string id="6150337">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6150338">I'm not doing this for the money.</string>
  <string id="6150339">No.</string>
  <string id="6150340">Very well.</string>
  <string id="6150343">I have to go.</string>
  <string id="6150344">Farewell.</string>
  <string id="6150345">I will be here, regardless.</string>
  <string id="6150354">Blessed art thou who exists in the sight of the Maker. Sing of the Chant so that it may reach His ears. </string>
  <string id="6150358">Blessed are they who stand before the corrupt and the wicked and do not falter.</string>
  <string id="6150361">Blessed are the peacekeepers, the champions of the just. </string>
  <string id="6150366">I must go.</string>
  <string id="6150368">What part of demon did you not hear? You cannot ask me to deal with this monster.</string>
  <string id="6150374">This is why I left the Wardens. I hate the blighted Deep Roads...</string>
  <string id="6150379">Merrill...</string>
  <string id="6150385">It's all right.</string>
  <string id="6150480">Guardsman Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6150483">Everything all right around here?</string>
  <string id="6150486">So far, yes.</string>
  <string id="6150487">Keep those weapons sheathed.</string>
  <string id="6150491">Greetings, messere.</string>
  <string id="6150498">Captain!</string>
  <string id="6150501">At ease, Guardsman.</string>
  <string id="6150502">Champion.</string>
  <string id="6150509">Good day, citizen.</string>
  <string id="6150514">Careful walking these parts at night.</string>
  <string id="6150517">Nobody follows the law anymore.</string>
  <string id="6150518">Sighs What's the point?</string>
  <string id="6150519">Hmm. Wonder if it's time for a drink yet?</string>
  <string id="6150542">I keep getting lost here. The last time I went to the market by myself, it took me four hours to find my way home.</string>
  <string id="6150545">I don't know why, but I always feel very nervous being out here at night.</string>
  <string id="6150668">Locket</string>
  <string id="6150673">Look at the ships! I wonder where they're headed.</string>
  <string id="6150676">Hightown is so much cleaner than the alienage.</string>
  <string id="6150679">I think I stepped in something.</string>
  <string id="6150682">So many Qunari lately. Do you think they like it here?</string>
  <string id="6150685">Does anyone else think it smells funny here? Like really old, dead fish?</string>
  <string id="6150688">Why would people want to live underneath the city? Apart from dwarves, I mean.</string>
  <string id="6150691">My whole clan could camp in here and you'd never even find them!</string>
  <string id="6150694">You know, I think this might not be the nicest part of Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6150697">It occurs to me: I don't know how Sundermount got its name. Certainly isn't elven, is it?</string>
  <string id="6150700">Is the coast really wounded? How did that happen? Can't it be healed?</string>
  <string id="6150703">How does anybody live down here in the dark? Don't they bump into things?</string>
  <string id="6150706">Is that statue-lady supposed to be someone important? She looks a bit cross.</string>
  <string id="6150709">Why do they call this a brothel? Does it have something to do with broth?</string>
  <string id="6150712">It's awfully noisy in here.</string>
  <string id="6150713">Some trouble earlier, but it's quiet now.</string>
  <string id="6150714">Nothing you need worry about.</string>
  <string id="6150715">Ouch.</string>
  <string id="6150726">Dead Body</string>
  <string id="6150731">You know nothing of spirits! Don't try to spread your ignorance.</string>
  <string id="6150734">If demons weren't helpful, no one would take their deals. Do not trust it.</string>
  <string id="6150737">And no one minds having to pick up and move, over and over, just to protect a few of you?</string>
  <string id="6150740">Why would they mind? Once we've picked over a hunting ground, there's no reason to stay.</string>
  <string id="6150743">You don't know how good you've got it.</string>
  <string id="6150866">Surely there was a safer way.</string>
  <string id="6150871">Did you hear something?</string>
  <string id="6150875">You're telling me.</string>
  <string id="6150880">I've heard this speech before. It's a whole darkspawn religious thing.</string>
  <string id="6150882">Bad plan.</string>
  <string id="6150887">Ooh. And I didn't like them the other way...</string>
  <string id="6150890">Search the Lowtown foundry for Leandra.</string>
  <string id="6150905">Between the Circle and Ghyslain, is it any wonder these women ran away?</string>
  <string id="6150914">I fell off the pier once. The harbor is really deep!</string>
  <string id="6150917">I like it better here at night. You can't see the large scary men as clearly.</string>
  <string id="6150920">Have I mentioned that I don't really like it here?</string>
  <string id="6150923">I think I saw sparrows in the rafters!</string>
  <string id="6150962">This place is so dismal.</string>
  <string id="6150965">I think the mountain has actually gotten sadder since I've been away.</string>
  <string id="6150976">Everyone seems so worried, lately.</string>
  <string id="6150979">I think I heard someone. Did you?</string>
  <string id="6150982">You know, I sort of miss the Qunari. They didn't talk much, but they were easy on the eyes.</string>
  <string id="6150985">It's a pretty evening, don't you agree?</string>
  <string id="6150988">Do you think we could go swimming later?</string>
  <string id="6150991">Think positive, Merrill. The Deep Roads have a prodigious collection of... rocks.</string>
  <string id="6150994">The music here is so pretty, but I can never figure out the lyrics.</string>
  <string id="6150997">Someone spilled ale in here. Weeks ago, by the smell.</string>
  <string id="6151000">Isabela said the next time we came here she would teach me to do something called body shots.</string>
  <string id="6151003">Oh! I think I saw a fish jumping!</string>
  <string id="6151006">Why does it always smell like cabbage here?</string>
  <string id="6151009">This place would be nicer if they opened it up to get some sunlight. Of course, I guess Kirkwall would collapse, then.</string>
  <string id="6151012">This place is so sad now. The stones remember what happened to the viscount.</string>
  <string id="6151021">Please, messere, can you spare nothing?</string>
  <string id="6151024">I am but a poor man...</string>
  <string id="6151027">Of course, serah.</string>
  <string id="6151028">You think I have coin to spare?</string>
  <string id="6151029">Again? Sighs</string>
  <string id="6151033">All I ask is for a simple copper bit.</string>
  <string id="6151036">I beg you...</string>
  <string id="6151039">Of course, serah.</string>
  <string id="6151040">You think I have coin to spare?</string>
  <string id="6151041">Again? Sighs</string>
  <string id="6151045">Have you nothing to spare, messere?</string>
  <string id="6151048">Blasted beggars.</string>
  <string id="6151049">Keep your hands away from me, filth!</string>
  <string id="6151050">For you? Not a chance.</string>
  <string id="6151054">A coin, messere?</string>
  <string id="6151057">The Maker watches over the meek and the wicked alike.</string>
  <string id="6151058">I am but a simple servant of the Maker, serah.</string>
  <string id="6151059">Come to the chantry, serah, and there you may receive your alms after service.</string>
  <string id="6151069">Is there nothing you could spare, messere?</string>
  <string id="6151070">Might the beautiful lady have a coin or two?</string>
  <string id="6151071">Surely a man of such accomplishment has something to spare?</string>
  <string id="6151075">Champion! Take pity!</string>
  <string id="6151076">Praise the mighty Champion!</string>
  <string id="6151080">Have you anything to spare?</string>
  <string id="6151081">I've three children to feed!</string>
  <string id="6151082">Andraste's grace, have mercy!</string>
  <string id="6151083">Alms for the poor!</string>
  <string id="6151093">Someone really ought to plant some flowers out here. Spruce things up.</string>
  <string id="6151096">I hate to say it, but my ancestors were not thinking clearly when they decided to bury people on top of a mountain.</string>
  <string id="6151099">I bet people would come here more often if they called it the Happy Coast.</string>
  <string id="6151102">Poor Andraste... she looks so sad. I suppose it's because of mages or Tevinter or something.</string>
  <string id="6151105">I'm not exactly sure why we keep coming here.</string>
  <string id="6151108">Do you think there's time for Varric to tell us a story while we're here?</string>
  <string id="6151111">Which ones are the stalactites and which are the stalagmites? I never remember.</string>
  <string id="6151115">Could we stop by my house in the alienage? Just for a bit?</string>
  <string id="6151116">Yeah, that's right. I know you want it.</string>
  <string id="6151135">Careful, Jeven. Those are broad strokes you're painting.</string>
  <string id="6151136">Does the same apply to me?</string>
  <string id="6151137">You preaching loyalty is pretty damned funny, Jeven.</string>
  <string id="6151138">Betrayed any guards lately?</string>
  <string id="6151141">Storeroom</string>
  <string id="6151142">Anteroom</string>
  <string id="6151145">Darktown</string>
  <string id="6151147">Madam Lusine</string>
  <string id="6151149">You're nothing to me, Champion. Your title is a conceit, the appeasement of a thug.</string>
  <string id="6151152">All I see is a foreigner manipulating the captain of the guard.</string>
  <string id="6151153">No discussion, not with this fanatic.</string>
  <string id="6151154">I'm ending this.</string>
  <string id="6151161">Ooh, if it isn't the Champion!</string>
  <string id="6151162">Ha! You beat those Qunari right out of here!</string>
  <string id="6151163">I heard you got rich in the Deep Roads. Why didn't I think of that?</string>
  <string id="6151164">You don't scare me! You think you're so tough?</string>
  <string id="6151165">Why don't I ever get to be the hero?</string>
  <string id="6151166">Oh... excuse me, messere.</string>
  <string id="6151170">I could've... I might've... whatever.</string>
  <string id="6151171">That's right, you heard me!</string>
  <string id="6151172">Can never find my way around this place.</string>
  <string id="6151173">Where's the damned privy?</string>
  <string id="6151174">Oh, the missus is going to be fired up this time for sure.</string>
  <string id="6151175">Mutters</string>
  <string id="6151176">Mutters</string>
  <string id="6151215">Fereldan, are you? We are not a charitable organization, serah.</string>
  <string id="6151218">If you cannot pay, you will have to take your lonely self elsewhere, is that clear?</string>
  <string id="6151221">Two sovereigns for premium service. One sovereign for standard service. Fifty silver and someone may touch you. Briefly.</string>
  <string id="6151224">You've been an apostate your whole life.</string>
  <string id="6151227">Exactly. It was never anything I had to work for.</string>
  <string id="6151230">Other people always took the risks to keep me free.</string>
  <string id="6151233">It was meant well. I don't know if that's enough to forgive me.</string>
  <string id="6151236">It must have been hard for him, being trapped outside the Fade. In a place where no one's like him.</string>
  <string id="6151239">I bet he appreciated having a friend.</string>
  <string id="6151242">He did.</string>
  <string id="6151245">He served elsewhere. He was coming to find me at Ostagar.</string>
  <string id="6151248">Were you familiar with every templar in Lothering?</string>
  <string id="6151251">How else was I supposed to know when to run and hide?</string>
  <string id="6151254">Oh?</string>
  <string id="6151257">My brother was a soldier. It's all about taking land and serving some king you've never met.</string>
  <string id="6151260">Guardsmen, they do something real. They protect people. They make their lives better.</string>
  <string id="6151263">I don't know if I agree.</string>
  <string id="6151266">Neither would my brother.</string>
  <string id="6151269">It's all right.</string>
  <string id="6151272">I was a soldier and he was a templar. We knew that our personal lives would have to wait.</string>
  <string id="6151275">Distance never mattered, but we ran out of time. It is what it is.</string>
  <string id="6151278">Now that he's gone, do you ever wish—</string>
  <string id="6151281">That's too personal.</string>
  <string id="6151284">I was a slave.</string>
  <string id="6151287">Still, it was your home, right? The only one you remember?</string>
  <string id="6151290">Does it ever feel strange not to be there?</string>
  <string id="6151293">Sometimes. That does not mean I would go back.</string>
  <string id="6151296">So I'm told.</string>
  <string id="6151299">Does it hurt?</string>
  <string id="6151302">You do not want to know the answer to that.</string>
  <string id="6151305">I had a husband. He didn't beat me, that's about the best I can say about it.</string>
  <string id="6151308">So you left him?</string>
  <string id="6151311">He was murdered. By my lover. It was all very... Antivan.</string>
  <string id="6151314">Oh. I don't think I'd like to live in Antiva.</string>
  <string id="6151320">Men. Women. Elves. A dwarf in drag once, but I don't recommend that.</string>
  <string id="6151323">Oh.</string>
  <string id="6151326">Aw... you're blushing! Why? How many lovers have you had?</string>
  <string id="6151329">I-I never—</string>
  <string id="6151332">You're a virgin? Hawke, you've been holding out on the poor girl! Get her a night at the Blooming Rose. On me!</string>
  <string id="6151335">That's, um, very generous.</string>
  <string id="6151338">I'm a giver.</string>
  <string id="6151341">Any child with the gift of magic is apprenticed to a Keeper... in another clan if there's no need in her own.</string>
  <string id="6151344">That sounds nice.</string>
  <string id="6151347">Magic is a gift of the Creators. Why wouldn't we use it?</string>
  <string id="6151350">It just seems... wasteful for humans to lock their mages away where they can't do any good.</string>
  <string id="6151353">Of course, you're a blood mage.</string>
  <string id="6151356">Oh. Right.</string>
  <string id="6151357">But... you are a blood mage.</string>
  <string id="6151360">I left my clan when I was a child to become Marethari's First.</string>
  <string id="6151363">I haven't seen my parents in more than ten years.</string>
  <string id="6151366">I'm so sorry! My father died in the Blight. You must really miss them.</string>
  <string id="6151369">I remember my mother singing to me, when I was a little girl and I'd get sick. I think that's what I miss the most.</string>
  <string id="6151372">The Keeper has a terrible singing voice.</string>
  <string id="6151373">Portrait of the Past</string>
  <string id="6151377">Not one stitch will be out of place. I can promise you that.</string>
  <string id="6151383">Too far, Jeven!</string>
  <string id="6151386">It is obvious, and I will put an end to it!</string>
  <string id="6151389">Here's your gold.</string>
  <string id="6151390">I'll buy premium service.</string>
  <string id="6151391">One sovereign. Happy now?</string>
  <string id="6151392">I'll buy the standard service.</string>
  <string id="6151393">Take your coins.</string>
  <string id="6151394">I can pay the fifty silver.</string>
  <string id="6151395">I'm not interested.</string>
  <string id="6151396">No thanks.</string>
  <string id="6151397">You're not this desperate, I hope. I treat a lot of these customers in my clinic.</string>
  <string id="6151398">Wait, what exactly are you paying for? I was busy... trying not to touch anything in here.</string>
  <string id="6151399">Hmm... maybe I'll get one of my own.</string>
  <string id="6151400">Disgusting.</string>
  <string id="6151401">Bethany might be interested in the old portrait of her mother. Speak with her about it back at Gamlen's house.</string>
  <string id="6151403">Bethany was very grateful for this gift.</string>
  <string id="6151447">And here I thought it took blood magic to read minds.</string>
  <string id="6151450">I had a twin brother, Carver. He used to nail my braid to the bed while I was sleeping.</string>
  <string id="6151453">I never thought I'd miss him this much.</string>
  <string id="6151456">Sorry about your brother.</string>
  <string id="6151459">Hey, you want mine? I've got a spare...</string>
  <string id="6151462">Great Ancestors, no! You know what Orzammar is?</string>
  <string id="6151465">It's cramped tunnels, filled with nug-shit and body-odor.</string>
  <string id="6151468">And every person there thinks he's better than you because his great-great-great grandfather made a water-clock or something.</string>
  <string id="6151471">But they're your people. Don't you even wonder what it would be like?</string>
  <string id="6151474">I have a good imagination. Why would I waste it on that?</string>
  <string id="6151477">Back again? Well, we're always happy to see young men with coin in their pockets.</string>
  <string id="6151478">So, the young lady returns for more. Welcome back.</string>
  <string id="6151487">Where did you get this? It's not even forged.</string>
  <string id="6151488">It looks genuine.</string>
  <string id="6151489">Very well. The ladies and gentlemen are in the lounge. Make your choice and go upstairs.</string>
  <string id="6151490">Of course you aren't. Poverty had nothing to do with your decision, I'm sure.</string>
  <string id="6151496">We have a wide array of potions and magical items.</string>
  <string id="6151497">Please do not steal the merchandise. I will be beaten if you do.</string>
  <string id="6151503">Please, have a look around. We've something to suit everyone!</string>
  <string id="6151506">Our service providers are in the lounge. Take your pick.</string>
  <string id="6151546">Best armor in Kirkwall right here!</string>
  <string id="6151552">Amell Estate's Cellar Key</string>
  <string id="6151572">My best people are in the lounge. Speak to whomever you'd like.</string>
  <string id="6151582">Portrait of Your Mother</string>
  <string id="6151586">Grandfather Amell's Will and Testament</string>
  <string id="6151590">Tobrius's Documents</string>
  <string id="6151623">Premium, standard, or the cheap?</string>
  <string id="6151624">I've got gold, so give me the best.</string>
  <string id="6151625">Premium.</string>
  <string id="6151626">Here's a sovereign.</string>
  <string id="6151627">Standard.</string>
  <string id="6151628">Fifty silver it is.</string>
  <string id="6151629">Cheap.</string>
  <string id="6151630">I might try something later.</string>
  <string id="6151631">Nothing this time.</string>
  <string id="6151632">Do you have something just for really bad boys?</string>
  <string id="6151633">I want the bad boy special.</string>
  <string id="6151634">Don't you provide a service just for girls who've been bad?</string>
  <string id="6151635">I want the bad girl special.</string>
  <string id="6151636">Melson</string>
  <string id="6151640">Father's Letters</string>
  <string id="6151660">Grigor</string>
  <string id="6151674">I swore the guards would never have to question their captain again.</string>
  <string id="6151704">Of course. All my best people are in the lounge, ready to serve.</string>
  <string id="6151705">So it is.</string>
  <string id="6151706">Good enough, I suppose.</string>
  <string id="6151707">Of course.</string>
  <string id="6151708">I have just the thing.</string>
  <string id="6151869">Fereldan, aren't you? You all smell the same.</string>
  <string id="6151870">Well, aren't you a pretty thing?</string>
  <string id="6151873">Master Harlan! It's always a pleasure, sir.</string>
  <string id="6151884">I'm the captain. The guards need to see me lead.</string>
  <string id="6151889">The ladies and gentlemen are in the lounge, ready to serve you.</string>
  <string id="6151892">The guards need to see me lead. I must have their confidence.</string>
  <string id="6151909">You know where to go. And try not to make a mess this time!</string>
  <string id="6151920">As Divine Aurelia wrote to the Nevarrans: Only the penitent shall regain the Maker's love.</string>
  <string id="6152069">Hmm. Well, you look like you have coin to spend, at least. Welcome to the Blooming Rose.</string>
  <string id="6152075">If it isn't the handsomest young man in Kirkwall!</string>
  <string id="6152076">Ah, my dear Mistress Hawke, welcome!</string>
  <string id="6152079">Welcome back, Master Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6152080">Mistress Hawke, lovely to see you again.</string>
  <string id="6152083">My people offer three types of service. For two sovereigns, you get the royal treatment.</string>
  <string id="6152113">Feynriel told me you stole my doublet. Give it back! I want my doublet!</string>
  <string id="6152116">Your doublet? Melson, I purchased one from you a fortnight ago, with my own coin.</string>
  <string id="6152119">That was my coin! My coin, not yours, mine, not yours!</string>
  <string id="6152122">Now, we're slashing prices, and you'll pay. Oh yes, you'll pay handsomely.</string>
  <string id="6152128">New customers! If you've come for the sale, you'll be sorely disappointed. They've stolen all the clothes!</string>
  <string id="6152129">I'm sure we can get to the bottom of this. Just put down your weapon.</string>
  <string id="6152130">Let's talk about this.</string>
  <string id="6152131">Looks like your customers paid dearly. </string>
  <string id="6152132">Bargains to die for, eh?</string>
  <string id="6152133">You're insane. Lay down your arms or join your victims.</string>
  <string id="6152134">You killed these people?</string>
  <string id="6152137">One sovereign gets you the standard services. For fifty silver, someone pretends to like you for an hour.</string>
  <string id="6152143">Well, well... the Champion visits the Blooming Rose. What an occasion.</string>
  <string id="6152148">And here comes my favorite customer!</string>
  <string id="6152151">Welcome back, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6152157">What can I provide you with today?</string>
  <string id="6152158">Here's two sovereigns. I want the best you've got.</string>
  <string id="6152159">Give me the best.</string>
  <string id="6152160">Here's one gold sovereign.</string>
  <string id="6152161">Standard treatment.</string>
  <string id="6152162">Here's your coin.</string>
  <string id="6152163">I'll pay the fifty silver.</string>
  <string id="6152164">I'll need to think about it.</string>
  <string id="6152165">No, thank you.</string>
  <string id="6152170">What can we do for you today?</string>
  <string id="6152171">Give me something that will blow my mind.</string>
  <string id="6152172">I want something surprising.</string>
  <string id="6152173">I have just the thing.</string>
  <string id="6152174">Some of my men stand with you, but that is not their failing. It is mine.</string>
  <string id="6152177">What are you doing, Fereldan bitch?</string>
  <string id="6152180">What you never could! Admit fault! You were dragged away, denying with every step!</string>
  <string id="6152183">This man serves only himself! Hatred is not what makes Kirkwall strong, and I will not let my home fall to him.</string>
  <string id="6152196">Certainly, messere.</string>
  <string id="6152197">Very good.</string>
  <string id="6152198">All right, then.</string>
  <string id="6152199">Of course.</string>
  <string id="6152200">Champion! Help me! They're raving mad!</string>
  <string id="6152203">Thieves, all of them! Feynriel told me so, he did! This one jerked a jerkin, and that one nabbed knee-breeches.</string>
  <string id="6152206">And him? He got a gown and corset. What do you suppose he'll do with them, eh?</string>
  <string id="6152209">It's no use, Champion! They slaughtered the other guards without so much as a by your leave. They've gone insane!</string>
  <string id="6152212">Insane? Me? I see you thieves all dancing, dancing! But there's no music! Oh, you shall face the music, I say!</string>
  <string id="6152216">Melson's Guard</string>
  <string id="6152220">Melson's Guard</string>
  <string id="6152227">Give me the royal treatment.</string>
  <string id="6152228">The best.</string>
  <string id="6152229">I'll take the regular this time.</string>
  <string id="6152230">Standard service.</string>
  <string id="6152231">Nothing fancy.</string>
  <string id="6152232">The fifty-silver service.</string>
  <string id="6152233">I've got other business to deal with first.</string>
  <string id="6152234">Nothing right now.</string>
  <string id="6152235">Give me something completely different.</string>
  <string id="6152236">Something exotic.</string>
  <string id="6152243">Our companions are in the lounge. Choose whomever you like.</string>
  <string id="6152274">You deserve nothing less, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6152275">Very well, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6152276">Yes, of course.</string>
  <string id="6152277">Certainly, Champion. Make yourself comfortable in the lounge.</string>
  <string id="6152278">I know just the thing...</string>
  <string id="6152289">Enjoy yourself.</string>
  <string id="6152307">Where you going, darling?</string>
  <string id="6152310">Coughs</string>
  <string id="6152311">Maybe another time.</string>
  <string id="6152312">Oh, I'll be back, don't you worry!</string>
  <string id="6152313">Off with you!</string>
  <string id="6152317">Care for a night of fun, messere?</string>
  <string id="6152320">I'm a married man, serah.</string>
  <string id="6152321">Coughs</string>
  <string id="6152322">Maybe another time.</string>
  <string id="6152323">Off with you!</string>
  <string id="6152327">I have somewhere to store your coin, honey!</string>
  <string id="6152330">I'm certain you do.</string>
  <string id="6152331">I'm not falling for that again.</string>
  <string id="6152332">Little busy for that, I think.</string>
  <string id="6152336">How about a little love, sweetie?</string>
  <string id="6152339">A little? How about a lot?</string>
  <string id="6152340">You think I need to pay for it?</string>
  <string id="6152341">You're barking up the wrong tree tonight, darling.</string>
  <string id="6152351">Heard you like exploring the Deep Roads! Want to explore mine?</string>
  <string id="6152352">Now you look like you have a coin or two to rub together!</string>
  <string id="6152356">Well, if it isn't the Champion! Care for a roll in the hay?</string>
  <string id="6152357">Oh, look who's slumming! The Champion of Kirkwall!</string>
  <string id="6152358">Hey, darling! Care to try your hand?</string>
  <string id="6152359">Just come to me, love, in case you ever want to sow oats of another kind!</string>
  <string id="6152363">Would you like to take a look at my diddies?</string>
  <string id="6152364">I'll be here, all night long!</string>
  <string id="6152365">Sighs It's going to be a long night.</string>
  <string id="6152366">Hey there, lovely!</string>
  <string id="6152367">Care for a ride, messere?</string>
  <string id="6152368">Laughs</string>
  <string id="6152523">Are you really going to make me spy on your men?</string>
  <string id="6152524">Is this posturing necessary?</string>
  <string id="6152525">You made it necessary with the doubt in your voice just now. I won't have it!</string>
  <string id="6152526">Someone has questioned my leadership. No way that goes unanswered.</string>
  <string id="6152527">I don't have to see proof. I already believe you.</string>
  <string id="6152528">You don't need to convince me.</string>
  <string id="6152529">That's not the impression I got. You raised the doubt, so you get to play messenger.</string>
  <string id="6152532">Donnic's patrol, Hawke. Me and you. Tonight.</string>
  <string id="6152535">Accuse me of being soft? Not in this lifetime.</string>
  <string id="6152536">Of course you do. But nobody questions my leadership without a response.</string>
  <string id="6152543">You'll be lucky if you have time. You'll see. No one questions me or my men.</string>
  <string id="6152546">Good, because there's no way I would let this go.</string>
  <string id="6152549">Cullen wants to know if these things are true? You'll be able to tell him.</string>
  <string id="6152560">If I live to a hundred, I will never understand his kind.</string>
  <string id="6152563">To the barracks, Hawke. My guardsmen will be waiting.</string>
  <string id="6152566">I understand King Alistair has proven adequate, although the queen seems to allow him certain... liberties in his company.</string>
  <string id="6152571">I hope you know what you're doing. Because this is it.</string>
  <string id="6152574">We'll show them, Hawke. We always do.</string>
  <string id="6152575">Back to the barracks. For how much longer, I wonder?</string>
  <string id="6152576">The knight-commander requires parade armor for inspections.</string>
  <string id="6152579">Then stuff and mount it where she can see it. She doesn't inspect the guard. I do.</string>
  <string id="6152582">Meredith will not be pleased.</string>
  <string id="6152585">Meredith can mount it.</string>
  <string id="6152588">Then the world is lucky we can't stand each other.</string>
  <string id="6152592">As you were, Guardsman.</string>
  <string id="6152605">You cannot negotiate with demons.</string>
  <string id="6152606">You cannot negotiate with demons.</string>
  <string id="6152612">And he is so free to condemn others for the same sin.</string>
  <string id="6152615">And he is so free to condemn others for the same sin.</string>
  <string id="6152618">It was what he wanted. I would not have believed it if I hadn't seen it myself.</string>
  <string id="6152621">Well... I didn't expect that.</string>
  <string id="6152624">Imagine that...</string>
  <string id="6152627">Why do I keep making friends with people who want to spend all their free time in the bloody Deep Roads?</string>
  <string id="6152632">And here I thought you were unreasonable...</string>
  <string id="6152640">It's a demon at work. By this point, there's nothing human left inside.</string>
  <string id="6152643">As easy as it is to resort to a sword! You were created as a living weapon. Should you not be trusted with your freedom?</string>
  <string id="6152646">My powers are not controlled by a demon.</string>
  <string id="6152667">I cringe every time she says that. She has no idea what she's messing with.</string>
  <string id="6152670">I do! I have it totally under control.</string>
  <string id="6152689">Not where it counts, stubby.</string>
  <string id="6152692">Laughs</string>
  <string id="6152695">The Veil weakens in a place that suffers such great violence.</string>
  <string id="6152698">This is why dwarves don't do magic.</string>
  <string id="6152722">You were lucky to have her as long as you did. When the pain fades, that's what will matter.</string>
  <string id="6152723">You don't know my mother.</string>
  <string id="6152726">No. And I'm sorry I never will.</string>
  <string id="6152729">We're not together anymore.</string>
  <string id="6152730">I left her.</string>
  <string id="6152734">Some bartenders know of work in the area. You have anything for me?</string>
  <string id="6152735">Know of any jobs?</string>
  <string id="6152736">Sure, I have a board with odd jobs.</string>
  <string id="6152739">But you may not want to associate with those types. If I didn't have to, I wouldn't. Fair warning, right?</string>
  <string id="6152740">Show me the job board.</string>
  <string id="6152742">Let me see what work's available.</string>
  <string id="6152743">Show me the job board.</string>
  <string id="6152744">As you wish.</string>
  <string id="6152750">Hawke, someone left this for you. Said it was for a job well done.</string>
  <string id="6152751">One of your friends says he owes you money. Here you are.</string>
  <string id="6152752">I've got more coin for you for your odd jobs.</string>
  <string id="6152753">You the fixer, then? Thank Andraste. Just don't leave any evidence.</string>
  <string id="6152754">Leave it to me.</string>
  <string id="6152755">I'll take care of it.</string>
  <string id="6152756">I'm not fixing this. I'm bringing you to justice.</string>
  <string id="6152757">You'll pay for your crimes.</string>
  <string id="6152758">Not without a fight!</string>
  <string id="6152761">You here to get rid of poor Marco?</string>
  <string id="6152762">Leave it to me.</string>
  <string id="6152763">I'll take care of it.</string>
  <string id="6152764">You're paying for your crimes.</string>
  <string id="6152765">I'm taking you in.</string>
  <string id="6152766">I told her we shouldn't trust a snake like you. Boys!</string>
  <string id="6152772">Several of my own got killed today, but you avenged them.</string>
  <string id="6152775">I always pay my debts.</string>
  <string id="6152778">Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6152781">Another one of ours murdered. Get 'em!</string>
  <string id="6152791">Halla Carving</string>
  <string id="6152795">Sylvanwood Ring</string>
  <string id="6152799">The Blight is over... but how are we to get home?</string>
  <string id="6152800">Fereldans are not welcome here.</string>
  <string id="6152801">If only we knew the Hero of Ferelden would save us all...</string>
  <string id="6152804">I hear a mine outside the city is hiring Fereldans.</string>
  <string id="6152805">It's been years since we arrived, but nothing's changed.</string>
  <string id="6152806">There are no jobs in this city. Only more misery.</string>
  <string id="6152809">King Alistair sent a ship to bring many of us home, if we want to go. I wonder...</string>
  <string id="6152810">The Qunari are gone... but now this city has no ruler. What are we to do?</string>
  <string id="6152813">There's no hope for us here.</string>
  <string id="6152816">Signet Ring</string>
  <string id="6152818">It was often enough.</string>
  <string id="6152821">No one sets out to be a tyrant. They just... grow.</string>
  <string id="6152831">It's good she's thought this out.</string>
  <string id="6152853">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6152866">The Chantry has seen the abuses the templars get away with. Why would they not think to do the same?</string>
  <string id="6152904">Templars are cowards. They only pick on those whose lives they already hold in their hands.</string>
  <string id="6152944">Quintus</string>
  <string id="6152954">Porfiria</string>
  <string id="6153016">Gibberish</string>
  <string id="6153019">Feynriel... Feynriel...</string>
  <string id="6153028">I've known Melson for years. He was right sane before Feynriel got to him.</string>
  <string id="6153031">To think I didn't believe the tales of the Dream Stalker. I got to warn the others!</string>
  <string id="6153089">Uh-oh. Here it comes.</string>
  <string id="6153102">What can I get for you this time?</string>
  <string id="6153103">Welcome to the Blooming Rose. Personally, I wouldn't say it's blooming precisely, but the name's not my choice.</string>
  <string id="6153107">Good day, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6153108">Welcome, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6153122">What are you doing?</string>
  <string id="6153125">Anders, is it not?</string>
  <string id="6153130">What can I do for you today?</string>
  <string id="6153135">Any news I should know about?</string>
  <string id="6153136">Heard anything interesting?</string>
  <string id="6153137">I don't need anything.</string>
  <string id="6153138">Nothing for me, thanks.</string>
  <string id="6153161">I'm sure the viscount never let a free mage step foot in there.</string>
  <string id="6153162">The home of leadership in Kirkwall, such as it is.</string>
  <string id="6153163">I think Mother has an audience there soon.</string>
  <string id="6153164">Mother would have us begging in there. That's not for me.</string>
  <string id="6153165">I've seen less ostentatious palaces.</string>
  <string id="6153166">Well, someone thinks he's important.</string>
  <string id="6153167">Those are the meanest looking birds I've ever seen, even if they are just statues.</string>
  <string id="6153168">You can't miss the Keep. It practically screams, Nothing fun ever happens here!</string>
  <string id="6153193">The grand cleric is a doddering fool. Kirkwall deserves better.</string>
  <string id="6153194">The Chantry. Not the symbol it could be.</string>
  <string id="6153195">I lit a candle there. For Carver.</string>
  <string id="6153196">A lot of candles for the dead in there. Seems like a waste of wax.</string>
  <string id="6153198">Let's go in and put out the eternal flame! </string>
  <string id="6153199">The chantry is so tall! How do you suppose they take all those banners down to clean them?</string>
  <string id="6153200">I like the chantry. This is the only place in Hightown where the Merchants Guild won't come looking for me.</string>
  <string id="6153215">Do you know that in Tevinter the Chantry receives a tithe for each slave sold?</string>
  <string id="6153226">Keep moving. I'd rather not be mistaken for a client of the Rose, thank you.</string>
  <string id="6153227">The Blooming Rose. What do you suppose goes on in there?</string>
  <string id="6153228">I wouldn't be caught dead in the Rose.</string>
  <string id="6153230">If you ever find yourself in there, ask for the Hunterhorn Special. You'll be glad you did.</string>
  <string id="6153231">It doesn't really look anything like a rose. Maybe they should change the name.</string>
  <string id="6153232">Be careful if you're going into the Rose. It's a favorite hangout for crime bosses and tax collectors.</string>
  <string id="6153236">Why do we come here so often?</string>
  <string id="6153238">Business appears to be good. Mind you, I imagine demand is fairly constant.</string>
  <string id="6153258">This is the heart of Kirkwall if you ask me.</string>
  <string id="6153259">Can we afford anything here?</string>
  <string id="6153260">When we're done in the Deep Roads, I'm buying everything.</string>
  <string id="6153261">I do love the way the merchants glare at me as if I'm going to steal something.</string>
  <string id="6153262">Don't worry, I'll keep my hands to myself.</string>
  <string id="6153263">There are so many... things! I don't even know what any of it is!</string>
  <string id="6153264">I spend way too much time here.</string>
  <string id="6153268">Do you really need me along for this?</string>
  <string id="6153290">You've certainly come a long way, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6153292">You should do something about your locks. They're remarkably easy to pick.</string>
  <string id="6153293">The outside of your house is so clean! Does someone wash it for you?</string>
  <string id="6153294">Nice to see this place fixed up again. It keeps property values in the neighborhood high.</string>
  <string id="6153300">You should really post some guards outside your estate, considering all the trouble you get into.</string>
  <string id="6153310">Frankly, I prefer the refugees.</string>
  <string id="6153311">Calm at the moment, but even Hightown has its troubles.</string>
  <string id="6153312">Mother must have played here as a girl.</string>
  <string id="6153313">Walking in Hightown is like shopping with empty pockets.</string>
  <string id="6153315">Who designed this city? These wide-open spaces are terrible for evading guards.</string>
  <string id="6153316">Did you ever notice how cold the pavement is here? No? Just me...</string>
  <string id="6153317">Stay out of the shadows. There are a hundred times more cutpurses here than in Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6153332">I don't wander around Hightown much. I sort of stick out.</string>
  <string id="6153342">Don't mind me. I'm just going to hide my face a little.</string>
  <string id="6153343">The heart of law in Kirkwall. If I have something to say about it, anyway.</string>
  <string id="6153344">Perhaps Carver would've worked here. With Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6153345">Another place that wouldn't have me. Let's just go.</string>
  <string id="6153346">Ah, and here we are in the center of power. Smell the oppression, everyone!</string>
  <string id="6153347">Coming in here of my own free will feels wrong. Like diddling a sister.</string>
  <string id="6153348">If the guards are inside the Keep, how do they guard it?</string>
  <string id="6153349">Strangely, this is the best place in the city for working shell games and changing forged coins.</string>
  <string id="6153374">Well, you're better off here than in the refugee camps.</string>
  <string id="6153375">You could do worse, Hawke. It's a roof.</string>
  <string id="6153376">It's killing Mother to live in this filth-hole.</string>
  <string id="6153377">Our glorious home. I swear Gamlen painted with shit and beer.</string>
  <string id="6153378">Your uncle's estate, I take it?</string>
  <string id="6153379">Your house reminds me of a crate I once slept in on the docks of Val Royeaux.</string>
  <string id="6153380">Is that your house? It's not so far from mine! We're neighbors! Except for the different neighborhoods thing.</string>
  <string id="6153381">No offense to your uncle, but this house smells like really old cabbage.</string>
  <string id="6153385">Aren't you glad you don't live here anymore?</string>
  <string id="6153386">Always remember where you started, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6153387">Your uncle must be happy to have his hovel back to himself.</string>
  <string id="6153388">It's still standing? Will wonders never cease?</string>
  <string id="6153389">I'm sure you miss your uncle from time to time, but his house does smell very strange, even from the street.</string>
  <string id="6153390">I was going to say something about being fond of that house, but who am I kidding? It makes Undercity look nice.</string>
  <string id="6153407">Free drinks for the guards, but accept and you wake up in the alley.</string>
  <string id="6153408">I think Uncle Gamlen comes here.</string>
  <string id="6153409">I come here a lot. Better than being cooped up with Gamlen.</string>
  <string id="6153411">The Hanged Man. Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name.</string>
  <string id="6153412">The sounds coming from inside are always so cheerful, but I never know what to do in there.</string>
  <string id="6153413">My favorite spot in the whole city. The taverns in Hightown are all owned by the Merchants Guild.</string>
  <string id="6153417">Justice doesn't let me get drunk anymore. I kind of miss it.</string>
  <string id="6153428">I still don't get the name. Did they hang someone here?</string>
  <string id="6153430">I think it's a stupid reference to being drunk.</string>
  <string id="6153439">I wish we could do without places like this. I really do.</string>
  <string id="6153440">Ooh. I won't complain about Uncle Gamlen's house anymore.</string>
  <string id="6153441">Scoffs Why do elves stay here if it's so horrible?</string>
  <string id="6153442">Must we come here? I hate these alienages.</string>
  <string id="6153443">Alienages. They're the same everywhere. Sighs</string>
  <string id="6153444">I still don't know what the big tree is for. It's sort of pretty, I suppose.</string>
  <string id="6153445">The elves who don't live here actually have it worse. I'd hate to be an elf in Darktown.</string>
  <string id="6153458">The elves should stand with us. They have suffered too.</string>
  <string id="6153471">Every piece of equipment in the Free Marches begins here.</string>
  <string id="6153472">What is this place?</string>
  <string id="6153473">Can't imagine slaving in here.</string>
  <string id="6153475">Smells like smoke, burning metal, and aeons of misery.</string>
  <string id="6153476">I get shivers just standing here.</string>
  <string id="6153477">Oh, right, the rusty metal spike district! My favorite part of town! Can we leave now?</string>
  <string id="6153490">This is the true picture of Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6153492">How many slaves died in these foundries, I wonder.</string>
  <string id="6153503">More trouble than commerce in this place.</string>
  <string id="6153504">Ooh! I wonder if they sell shoes!</string>
  <string id="6153505">A market I can afford, and I don't want a bloody thing.</string>
  <string id="6153507">Almost everything here's stolen from someone else.</string>
  <string id="6153508">The merchants here keep trying to sell me shoes. I'm not sure why.</string>
  <string id="6153509">The Merchants Guild has their fingers in all these pies. Well, not the actual pies. They're clean as far as I know.</string>
  <string id="6153513">How can you stand the clamor?</string>
  <string id="6153515">The Minrathous slave bazaar is like this. They say the alleys are ten miles long.</string>
  <string id="6153535">The gate to the Qunari. They do not like visitors.</string>
  <string id="6153536">That beast in Lothering killed one of my best friends. I hate Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6153537">We had one Qunari in Lothering. It was enough.</string>
  <string id="6153540">They're so big and grim. What do you suppose would happen if I tickled one of them?</string>
  <string id="6153541">I kind of like the Qunari. You always know what they want: absolutely nothing.</string>
  <string id="6153545">It's hard to tell, but do they seem... grouchier than usual?</string>
  <string id="6153547">It seems the Qunari aren't exactly in a hurry to return home.</string>
  <string id="6153558">Not the best view of the Gallows... if there is one.</string>
  <string id="6153559">I wouldn't want to live in there.</string>
  <string id="6153560">A nice view of the sea... if there were windows.</string>
  <string id="6153562">Kirkwall isn't a bad city, but this view really does it no favors.</string>
  <string id="6153563">What an awful place this is.</string>
  <string id="6153564">Can we skip the Gallows? I've had my oppression for the day, thanks.</string>
  <string id="6153568">I don't think it's a coincidence they picked a prison to house their mages.</string>
  <string id="6153579">They say this harbor was created by the magisters long ago.</string>
  <string id="6153589">More refugees pouring in every day...</string>
  <string id="6153590">Not a wise place to linger.</string>
  <string id="6153591">I should've left my good shoes at home.</string>
  <string id="6153592">Well, Gamlen's place is starting to seem nice.</string>
  <string id="6153594">Be careful. Look at someone wrong here, and you'll get a knife in the back.</string>
  <string id="6153595">You know, I think this isn't a very nice part of Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6153596">Have I mentioned that I hate this part of town? Maker help me, I'd rather go to the Merchants Guild.</string>
  <string id="6153611">These warehouses are occasionally used to store things... and not just for clandestine meetings.</string>
  <string id="6153621">Darktown. No better place to disappear.</string>
  <string id="6153622">People choose to live here? It amazes me.</string>
  <string id="6153623">The refugees live here? It's almost enough to make me grateful for Uncle Gamlen.</string>
  <string id="6153624">Well, now we know where the sewers lead.</string>
  <string id="6153626">Poor sods. Look at them. There's no hope in this place.</string>
  <string id="6153627">I wander in here by accident sometimes when I'm trying to get home from the market. It's a scary place.</string>
  <string id="6153628">I imagine Orzammar is like this, only with beards and an overwhelming sense of superiority.</string>
  <string id="6153634">The dregs of humanity, down with its waste. Fitting.</string>
  <string id="6153654">Rule of thumb: if the criminal runs to the sewers, he's gone.</string>
  <string id="6153655">Why are we traipsing around in human waste again?</string>
  <string id="6153656">Adventure. I'm not feeling it.</string>
  <string id="6153657">An excellent place to hide. I'm surprised the templars catch anyone in this city.</string>
  <string id="6153658">I'm fond of a little dirt now and then, but this... was this really necessary?</string>
  <string id="6153659">Well, this is certainly... fragrant. At least we can't get rained on!</string>
  <string id="6153660">Could I suggest that we never come here again?</string>
  <string id="6153664">The sewers aren't half as bad as the Deep Roads.</string>
  <string id="6153685">The gates are shut. Not a good sign for a lot of people.</string>
  <string id="6153686">What's happening? Why aren't they letting anyone in?</string>
  <string id="6153687">Why don't they open their bloody gates?</string>
  <string id="6153691">They put the Tranquil on display out here to intimidate other mages.</string>
  <string id="6153692">How many people didn't make it out of here? We were lucky.</string>
  <string id="6153693">I was so worried they'd never let us past here.</string>
  <string id="6153694">I would've been happy never to come back here.</string>
  <string id="6153695">Those statues were meant to intimidate slaves. You see ones like them all over the Imperium.</string>
  <string id="6153696">Well, this is cheerful.</string>
  <string id="6153697">Why would anybody make a place like this?</string>
  <string id="6153698">I think that statue over there is a statement on modern life. Possibly the statement is, Well, shit.</string>
  <string id="6153724">A place of slavery and necessity. Kirkwall could not have existed without its mines.</string>
  <string id="6153725">Why would anyone work here?</string>
  <string id="6153726">There are jobs to be had if this is all you want. I'd rather starve.</string>
  <string id="6153727">They have good reason to call it the Bone Pit.</string>
  <string id="6153728">There was a brothel on the slummy side of Antiva City called the Bone Pit. It was entirely different from this.</string>
  <string id="6153729">I... think I liked it better inside the city.</string>
  <string id="6153730">There's work here, but I wouldn't call it paying work.</string>
  <string id="6153734">So, I guess there are still no good jobs for Fereldans, then.</string>
  <string id="6153756">It's hard to believe we came all that way to get here.</string>
  <string id="6153757">I can almost see Ferelden from here.</string>
  <string id="6153758">You can almost see home from here. What's left of it, I guess.</string>
  <string id="6153759">Well, it's official. I have traveled all the way from the northern coast to the southern.</string>
  <string id="6153760">I miss being on the sea.</string>
  <string id="6153761">Ooh, that's quite the view!</string>
  <string id="6153762">Water. Pretty exciting, I know.</string>
  <string id="6153775">We're out of Kirkwall but not out of the knight-commander's reach.</string>
  <string id="6153788">I prefer the city, it's more... ordered.</string>
  <string id="6153789">It's nice to see trees again. I'm not really a city girl.</string>
  <string id="6153790">Not exactly welcoming, but it's a nice break from Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6153792">Watch out for the squirrels. They can be vicious little bastards.</string>
  <string id="6153793">Can you smell that? The wind... I'd started to forget what fresh air was.</string>
  <string id="6153794">I am not the outdoors type. The sooner we're back in the city, the happier I'll be.</string>
  <string id="6153798">I haven't had good experiences with wilderness...</string>
  <string id="6153809">Traipsing through dirt... Why the Dalish enjoy this, I'll never know.</string>
  <string id="6153820">The guards don't come this far out. It's better for both sides.</string>
  <string id="6153821">Is this safe? I thought the Dalish kill outsiders.</string>
  <string id="6153822">Someone goes to the trouble to be this isolated, you let them.</string>
  <string id="6153823">Hmm. No herd of halla? I thought all Dalish clans had them.</string>
  <string id="6153824">Elven land-ships! Screw sea-ships, I want one of those!</string>
  <string id="6153825">My poor clan. The sooner they move away from here, the better.</string>
  <string id="6153826">By all means, let's go up to the angry wandering elves and say hello!</string>
  <string id="6153830">In my experience, all Dalish women are crazy.</string>
  <string id="6153852">We're not welcome on this path.</string>
  <string id="6153853">Pants I need to get more exercise.</string>
  <string id="6153854">I don't climb mountains!</string>
  <string id="6153856">What could go wrong climbing an ancient elven burial site? Nothing at all, I'm sure.</string>
  <string id="6153857">The war here woke the dead. Many things that should be sleeping prowl this mountain.</string>
  <string id="6153858">Andraste's sanctified ass! Why would anyone make the ground vertical?</string>
  <string id="6153862">If we had a giant rock to push uphill, this would perfectly sum up my life.</string>
  <string id="6153873">You can feel how thin the Veil is up here. Perfect place to bury your dead. The ancient elves were brilliant.</string>
  <string id="6153883">I swore I would never come down here again.</string>
  <string id="6153884">Seems like the Deep Roads are deep for a reason.</string>
  <string id="6153885">I should've listened to Mother.</string>
  <string id="6153887">Darkspawn. Another charming gift from the magisters.</string>
  <string id="6153888">I don't like closed spaces. I really don't.</string>
  <string id="6153889">I miss the sky. This all feels wrong.</string>
  <string id="6153890">It's official: my ancestors were completely crazy.</string>
  <string id="6153896">I'm surprised these tunnels don't simply collapse.</string>
  <string id="6153915">Darkspawn ahead. I can still sense them.</string>
  <string id="6153916">I don't like dark places. This is not were I do the most good.</string>
  <string id="6153917">So this is where darkspawn come from. Bastards.</string>
  <string id="6153918">If the darkspawn claim this as home, I say we take it like they took ours.</string>
  <string id="6153920">We're lost, aren't we? We're going to die down here. I'm too young to die.</string>
  <string id="6153921">Evil is watching us from the darkness.</string>
  <string id="6153922">How long do you suppose it's been since anyone walked here? Other than darkspawn, I mean.</string>
  <string id="6153937">I wonder how much the dwarves have simply left behind... or forgotten.</string>
  <string id="6153967">What of it?</string>
  <string id="6153970">Are they all as dirty as they seem?</string>
  <string id="6153973">What?</string>
  <string id="6153976">Did he ever ask you to play the naughty mage and the hapless recruit? Maybe the secret desire demon and the upstanding knight?</string>
  <string id="6153979">That's disgusting!</string>
  <string id="6153982">I hear it's quite popular.</string>
  <string id="6153985">Of course! It was home. I would never have left willingly.</string>
  <string id="6153988">But I'm not going to be my father and spend my life trying to live a memory.</string>
  <string id="6153991">I didn't think I'd give it a second thought once I was gone. I mean, what did Ferelden ever do for me?</string>
  <string id="6153994">But I do. I think about it. There's something here that just doesn't feel right.</string>
  <string id="6153997">You mean how mages are treated?</string>
  <string id="6154000">No... I think there's not enough dog shit.</string>
  <string id="6154003">We're not pals.</string>
  <string id="6154006">We're not? What about that time we painted each other's toenails?</string>
  <string id="6154009">Do you want something?</string>
  <string id="6154012">Love, life, and liberty. What more does a man need?</string>
  <string id="6154015">You're in a jolly mood.</string>
  <string id="6154018">Well, when you're here, I know you're not leading men into Darktown to arrest me.</string>
  <string id="6154021">I cannot look the other way when mages break the law—</string>
  <string id="6154024">That's not what I was going to ask.</string>
  <string id="6154027">There's a girl. A mage apprentice. She... was murdered in the Gallows recently. Have you heard anything of it?</string>
  <string id="6154030">You mean the girl you killed.</string>
  <string id="6154033">Yes. I'd like to... attend the funeral. Do something.</string>
  <string id="6154036">The official templar report says she was killed by a demon of unknown origin.</string>
  <string id="6154039">Let her family mourn in peace.</string>
  <string id="6154042">She can't stall the process forever. It's not her place.</string>
  <string id="6154045">Leaving the viscount's seat empty will just tempt people to fight for it. It will cause more trouble than it prevents.</string>
  <string id="6154048">Well. You've got a brain in there after all.</string>
  <string id="6154051">I was convinced that headband was to keep it from falling out.</string>
  <string id="6154054">About what?</string>
  <string id="6154057">He thinks the knight-commander's mad. He told me she's gone behind your back to investigate guardsmen she suspects as secret mages.</string>
  <string id="6154060">Even if that were true, he wouldn't tell you.</string>
  <string id="6154063">He won't fight for her when the time comes. Would you turn against your own husband?</string>
  <string id="6154066">I don't know if you're lying or crazy.</string>
  <string id="6154073">May the Maker's gaze be upon you.</string>
  <string id="6154074">Blessed art thou who exists in the sight of the Maker. Sing of the Chant so that it may reach His ears. </string>
  <string id="6154098">I mean, you know my feelings on the Circle, but usually it's the only decent training a mage can get.</string>
  <string id="6154101">My father taught me. He was in the Circle once, trained there. But he got away.</string>
  <string id="6154104">You don't know how lucky you were, to have someone who loved you and could help you. Most mages would kill for that.</string>
  <string id="6154107">You remind me of him.</string>
  <string id="6154110">Right! If we want to fight back... or just engage in intelligent debate... they make sure we can't do it.</string>
  <string id="6154113">They're forcing our hands. There's no way to change things peacefully.</string>
  <string id="6154116">There must be something.</string>
  <string id="6154119">If it's Tranquility or death, we have no choice but to make every confrontation a life-or-death struggle.</string>
  <string id="6154122">I know, but... there are good people in the Circle, the Chantry. There has to be a way to reason with them.</string>
  <string id="6154128">Not if they take away your ability to reason.</string>
  <string id="6154140">The Gallows</string>
  <string id="6154141">The Gallows, to see Cullen</string>
  <string id="6154151">The nerve! Dwarves make excellent thieves, too, you know.</string>
  <string id="6154152">You're an elf. And besides, you're a great distraction for those of us who do steal.</string>
  <string id="6154155">It means being drunk.</string>
  <string id="6154158">Someone is hung if they are drunk, I think.</string>
  <string id="6154163">Actually, they did hang men here. By their feet. Until they starved.</string>
  <string id="6154166">Good thing they were drunk, then.</string>
  <string id="6154189">Why? Because she was a mage?</string>
  <string id="6154192">Your brother says she had a good heart. Being on the run never made her bitter.</string>
  <string id="6154195">Your other sister says she was a good person. She never turned down a chance to help people.</string>
  <string id="6154198">Yes, yes. I'm sure the Chantry's got a shrine with her portrait on it.</string>
  <string id="6154201">I was trying to be nice.</string>
  <string id="6154204">Stick to surly. It works for you.</string>
  <string id="6154207">The Blight, the dampness, the festering darkness filled with tainted rats...</string>
  <string id="6154210">Shut up.</string>
  <string id="6154213">You've got a real chip on your shoulder, you know?</string>
  <string id="6154216">I've got a big blade on my shoulder, magey.</string>
  <string id="6154219">Right. Wonder what you're compensating for.</string>
  <string id="6154257">You must act now to bring your son back to the Maker.</string>
  <string id="6154260">You may yet save him.</string>
  <string id="6154263">May the Maker's gaze be upon you, Viscount.</string>
  <string id="6154266">And on you, good sister.</string>
  <string id="6154279">You're not going to help her, are you?</string>
  <string id="6154282">Tell me you're not going to help her again.</string>
  <string id="6154285">Praise the Maker!</string>
  <string id="6154291">And others are thought mad right up until they're dragged screaming into the asylum.</string>
  <string id="6154297">Oh, she's there.</string>
  <string id="6154300">Definitely not.</string>
  <string id="6154303">For all of us.</string>
  <string id="6154306">I would pay to see that.</string>
  <string id="6154309">So, I guess we're going with presumed guilty?</string>
  <string id="6154312">Mages and templars, working together. I must be dreaming.</string>
  <string id="6154334">Foundry</string>
  <string id="6154335">Foundry</string>
  <string id="6154382">No. Some dogs submit easily to the leash. Others remember they are wolves.</string>
  <string id="6154385">And what would it take to change your mind?</string>
  <string id="6154411">What is it with elves and blood magic?</string>
  <string id="6154417">Sister, please, you must tell me. Is it really true that if I go back to the brothel... it will actually fall off?</string>
  <string id="6154420">Um, I'm only an initiate. I'm not... trained to deal with your kind of problems yet.</string>
  <string id="6154435">She flaunts what she can do to mages. She likes to rub our faces in it.</string>
  <string id="6154441">Your sister's a mage? You bloody hypocrite. You really are just jealous!</string>
  <string id="6154486">Lady Bartiere</string>
  <string id="6154500">I don't think that's wise, Hawke. Whatever she's trying to do with that mirror, it's at the behest of a demon.</string>
  <string id="6154503">No one asked you!</string>
  <string id="6154506">Over the blood mage? I vote yes.</string>
  <string id="6154548">How can you still be encouraging her after all that?</string>
  <string id="6154555">That was the noblest thing I've ever seen anyone do.</string>
  <string id="6154558">The world is poorer for having you in it instead of her.</string>
  <string id="6154571">I guess the Merchant Guild is in a pickle. Orzammar's sealed its doors, and not even dwarf caravans are getting in.</string>
  <string id="6154575">Orzammar's new king has opened the city to a lot of traders. Half the merchants in Thedas have deals there now.</string>
  <string id="6154576">Some Chantry scholar's saying he found Andraste's ashes. Load of rubbish, if you ask me.</string>
  <string id="6154577">The queen of Ferelden just made a state visit to Rivain. Can't imagine why. Not like Rivain's buying dogs. </string>
  <string id="6154590">Mother</string>
  <string id="6154612">A Debt in the Family</string>
  <string id="6154615">Master Hawke, what can I get for you?</string>
  <string id="6154616">Mistress Hawke, what'll you have today?</string>
  <string id="6154617">Find the moneylender, Senestra the Snake, in the Docks at night. Convince her to forgive Keran's family debts.</string>
  <string id="6154618">Senestra the Snake is dead, and Keran's family no longer needs to worry about eviction.</string>
  <string id="6154619">Senestra the Snake is dead, and Keran's family must no longer worry about eviction. Ser Margitte said she'd send a reward via letter.</string>
  <string id="6154699">I can't believe you'd show your face in here. Get your drinks somewhere else.</string>
  <string id="6154702">Everyone who used to grouse about the viscount is grousing about Meredith now. Nothing changes, I swear.</string>
  <string id="6154705">Nothing you don't know, I'm sure. Meredith and Orsino had a screaming fight in the Gallows. Same old.</string>
  <string id="6154706">They're saying one of the mansions in Hightown is haunted. Don't put much stock in the idea, myself.</string>
  <string id="6154709">I guess the Comte de Launcette's learned not to cross the Coterie. About time, I say.</string>
  <string id="6154710">I hear the knight-commander and the grand cleric aren't seeing eye to eye.</string>
  <string id="6154711">I heard someone was fighting pirates in the chantry. Pirates! What, were they after the altar?</string>
  <string id="6154712">Bartrand Tethras skipped town. Half the bloody Merchants' Guild wants his head now.</string>
  <string id="6154713">That viscount's son—what a disappointment. He's all philosophical and scholarly!</string>
  <string id="6154717">Keran discharged? But he's done nothing wrong!</string>
  <string id="6154721">I hope they find Keran soon... and Wilmod, of course.</string>
  <string id="6154722">Greetings, messere.</string>
  <string id="6154725">Master Hawke! We'll get a table ready for you, if you like. Harlan always had his favorite table reserved.</string>
  <string id="6154726">My lady! Welcome! Shall we get a table ready for you?</string>
  <string id="6154729">You heard about the Tethras expedition to the Deep Roads? They say the walls down there are made of gold.</string>
  <string id="6154730">Nobody knows what to think about these Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6154731">I heard another ship wrecked in the storm, same night as those oxmen. Nobody knows who it was, though.</string>
  <string id="6154732">They say the College of Magi in Cumberland is up to something. Nothing good can come of mages being political.</string>
  <string id="6154733">Someone in here yesterday said Dalish are camping on Sundermount. Hope the viscount sends men to chase them off.</string>
  <string id="6154734">I hear there's a new lady captain in the city guard who's mingling with the ranks, if you know what I mean.</string>
  <string id="6154735">Dalish Hunter</string>
  <string id="6154739">Hawke! Over here!</string>
  <string id="6154743">You were courageous to speak openly against the knight-commander.</string>
  <string id="6154746">Your words did not fall on deaf ears. Several nobles are discussing—quietly—what to do about Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6154749">I cannot tarry here for risk of templar spies. If you would make common cause with us, read this.</string>
  <string id="6154750">And... there we go again. This thing's magic seems only more potent when broken.</string>
  <string id="6154753">No! This thing is cursed. It can bring nothing but madness!</string>
  <string id="6154756">It's not your call, Blondie.</string>
  <string id="6154759">Varric, I beg you, destroy this thing.</string>
  <string id="6154762">I can't. I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6154765">That was the right decision, Hawke. You've saved him great pain.</string>
  <string id="6154769">Senestra</string>
  <string id="6154774">Templar</string>
  <string id="6154778">They don't trade, don't talk, seem to be miserable. Why don't they go back where they came from?</string>
  <string id="6154779">Templar Recruit Margitte</string>
  <string id="6154784">Mistress Merrill is away. Again. I'm almost certain she's in that hovel in the alienage.</string>
  <string id="6154789">A proper lord's child should be drinking and whoring, not meditating! It's sick!</string>
  <string id="6154870">I hear the new king of Ferelden is even dumber than the last one. I bet the Orlesians are thrilled.</string>
  <string id="6154903">We're always pleased to see you, Master Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6154906">Mistress Hawke! We're delighted to see you, as always.</string>
  <string id="6154909">Can we provide you with anything? On the house, of course.</string>
  <string id="6154910">I'm interested in some companionship.</string>
  <string id="6154911">I'd like some company.</string>
  <string id="6154912">I'll let you know if I want anything.</string>
  <string id="6154913">Nothing at the moment.</string>
  <string id="6154930">Speak to whomever you'd like.</string>
  <string id="6154931">Of course. Come back any time.</string>
  <string id="6154939">Champion, what can I get for you?</string>
  <string id="6154940">They say the Blight in Ferelden's already come and gone. Just like that! Barely a year.</string>
  <string id="6154943">Nobody ever heard of a Blight ending that fast. Lot of folks think it's all some sort of trick, now.</string>
  <string id="6154973">Long ago, slaves that dropped dead from exhaustion were thrown into a pit for all the others to see.</string>
  <string id="6154976">It served as intimidation and... convenient disposal.</string>
  <string id="6154982">You enjoy a crowded city so much more?</string>
  <string id="6154985">It's a stench I'm more familiar with, yes.</string>
  <string id="6154988">It wasn't always this way.</string>
  <string id="6154991">Are you sure about that? Logic wasn't our strong point, from the sound of it.</string>
  <string id="6154994">Dwarves made them.</string>
  <string id="6154997">Then I'm surprised they're not smaller.</string>
  <string id="6155004">Mountain Cave</string>
  <string id="6155107">Insurgent</string>
  <string id="6155111">Insurgent</string>
  <string id="6155115">Insurgent</string>
  <string id="6155119">Insurgent</string>
  <string id="6155124">Insurgent Guard</string>
  <string id="6155128">Insurgent Guard</string>
  <string id="6155132">Insurgent Guard</string>
  <string id="6155249">Not surprising. Grand Cleric Elthina is all sweetness and patience and forgiveness. Meredith... not even a little bit.</string>
  <string id="6155264">I'll get your order in a minute.</string>
  <string id="6155265">Whatever you do, stay away from Master Harlan. You'll end in little pieces.</string>
  <string id="6155285">Your table is ready for you, Master Harlan.</string>
  <string id="6155286">The usual?</string>
  <string id="6155290">Two meads and a dwarven ale.</string>
  <string id="6155291">Tell Sabina if her brat gets underfoot again, I'll drop-kick him out the door!</string>
  <string id="6155292">Quintus, where's my Montsimmard white wine?</string>
  <string id="6155295">I have to get it from the cellar. Send round some more nuts or something in the meantime.</string>
  <string id="6155305">Welcome, messere. Have a seat and I'll be right with you.</string>
  <string id="6155308">I swear by Andraste, you little monster, pinch me again and you're dead!</string>
  <string id="6155309">You, there! Did my love send you? Will you take me to him?</string>
  <string id="6155310">I come at your father's request. You expected someone else?</string>
  <string id="6155311">Your father sent me.</string>
  <string id="6155312">Either your father didn't give me the whole story, or I really, really hope you're talking about someone else.</string>
  <string id="6155313">Your love?</string>
  <string id="6155314">I don't know who you mean. Let's get you home.</string>
  <string id="6155315">I'm taking you home.</string>
  <string id="6155316">Feynriel, the man of my dreams! These brutes intended to take my maidenhood. As they argued about who would go first, I fainted!</string>
  <string id="6155319">Then Feynriel spoke to me in a vision and told me not to fear. When I awoke, the men had slain one another.</string>
  <string id="6155380">One Nevarran red wine. Anything else, Master Harlan?</string>
  <string id="6155381">Do you need anything, Master Harlan?</string>
  <string id="6155385">I'll be right back with that, sir.</string>
  <string id="6155388">Please take me to Feynriel. I want to thank him properly.</string>
  <string id="6155389">I'm sorry, but I have no way to locate him.</string>
  <string id="6155390">I don't know where he is.</string>
  <string id="6155391">You saw him in your dreams? Maybe we should sleep together, then go look for him.</string>
  <string id="6155392">You could thank me, instead.</string>
  <string id="6155393">Find him on your own. Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6155394">I don't have time for this.</string>
  <string id="6155395">Hey! What did you do to my men? I'll kill you till you're good and dead!</string>
  <string id="6155418">Hello? Is Anders there? Can I speak to Anders?</string>
  <string id="6155421">You can stop yelling. It's always me.</string>
  <string id="6155424">Oh, good. I didn't want to talk to that other guy. You know, the stick-in-the-mud.</string>
  <string id="6155427">He can still hear you. Justice and I are one.</string>
  <string id="6155430">Anyway, you wanted to talk to me?</string>
  <string id="6155433">Not really. I just wanted to make sure it was you.</string>
  <string id="6155472">So this relic you lost... how is it you don't know what it is?</string>
  <string id="6155475">It was in a box.</string>
  <string id="6155478">And you didn't open it? You managed to resist the urge?</string>
  <string id="6155481">It was locked. It was a locked box!</string>
  <string id="6155484">Hasn't stopped you before.</string>
  <string id="6155487">What do you want me to say?</string>
  <string id="6155490">Nothing. I just found it curious, that's all.</string>
  <string id="6155496">You do have an opinion on mages, don't you?</string>
  <string id="6155499">Of course I do. I just don't feel a constant need to bring it up.</string>
  <string id="6155505">Sighs Mages don't worry me. And I don't believe the templars when they say I should be worried.</string>
  <string id="6155508">I'm more likely to be shanked in a bar than eaten by an abomination. You can hear those coming a mile away.</string>
  <string id="6155511">Grr. Argh! Oh, is that an abomination coming to eat us? We should get out of here!</string>
  <string id="6155514">Abominations don't go, Grr. Argh.</string>
  <string id="6155517">They don't? I should rethink the whole thing, then.</string>
  <string id="6155523">I don't know how you live the way you do, blithely ignoring the consequences of your actions.</string>
  <string id="6155526">This is about the Qunari thing, isn't it? I'm not ignoring it. I just recognize that it happened years ago.</string>
  <string id="6155529">There's this fantastic thing called moving on. You should try it sometime.</string>
  <string id="6155532">Has it occurred to you that Kirkwall is only just recovering from the Qunari attack?</string>
  <string id="6155535">And you want me to... what? Flog myself daily?</string>
  <string id="6155538">Has it occurred to you that maybe there's no justice in the world? Other than that voice you keep in your head.</string>
  <string id="6155544">There is justice in the world.</string>
  <string id="6155547">Is there? You want to free the mages. Let's say you do, but to get there, you kill a bunch of innocent people.</string>
  <string id="6155550">What about them? Don't they then deserve justice?</string>
  <string id="6155553">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6155556">And then what? Where does it end?</string>
  <string id="6155559">It's like a bar brawl. People are continuously pulled into the fray, and nobody remembers why it started.</string>
  <string id="6155562">Justice is an idea. It makes sense in a world of ideas, but not in our world.</string>
  <string id="6155571">Do men find you intimidating? What about Wesley? Did he?</string>
  <string id="6155574">Isabela...</string>
  <string id="6155577">What? Too soon?</string>
  <string id="6155580">Too soon, too personal, too... everything coming from you!</string>
  <string id="6155583">Ooh, sore spot?</string>
  <string id="6155586">If you don't shut up, I'll give you a sore spot.</string>
  <string id="6155592">You have such pretty hair. What a lovely color.</string>
  <string id="6155595">Other children used to laugh at me for having ginger hair.</string>
  <string id="6155598">Really? Aww. I bet you were cute. Did you have pigtails?</string>
  <string id="6155601">Sometimes.</string>
  <string id="6155604">How precious! Little Aveline, running around the village with her flaming orange pigtails streaming behind her...</string>
  <string id="6155607">... and little boys all scattering and screaming for mercy as she approached.</string>
  <string id="6155610">Shut up, whore.</string>
  <string id="6155616">How are you so successful with men? You're not that pretty.</string>
  <string id="6155619">Cast a wide enough net, and you're bound to catch something.</string>
  <string id="6155622">Laughs At least you're willing to admit it.</string>
  <string id="6155625">Trust me. I've heard, Get away from me, you pirate hag! more times than I care to count.</string>
  <string id="6155628">Doesn't that bother you?</string>
  <string id="6155631">Why should it? They don't know me. I know me.</string>
  <string id="6155640">You're right.</string>
  <string id="6155643">About?</string>
  <string id="6155646">About knowing who you are.</string>
  <string id="6155649">I'm the captain of the guard. I'm loyal, strong, and I don't look too bad naked.</string>
  <string id="6155652">Exactly. And if I called you a mannish, awkward, ball-crushing do-gooder, you'd say...?</string>
  <string id="6155655">Shut up, whore.</string>
  <string id="6155658">That's my girl.</string>
  <string id="6155664">You didn't come to my solstice dinner party.</string>
  <string id="6155667">Look at you! Dinner parties, cooking... do you have a lace apron yet, or should I get one for you?</string>
  <string id="6155670">Don't change the subject. I sent you an invitation, and you didn't show up.</string>
  <string id="6155673">I thought it would be... I mean, I don't know. I just don't do family gatherings.</string>
  <string id="6155676">Besides, one day you and Donnic will have children, and I'll be the last person you want around them.</string>
  <string id="6155679">Imagine all the awkward questions you'd have to answer? Mother, what's a slattern?</string>
  <string id="6155682">I'll just point at you and say, That's a slattern.</string>
  <string id="6155688">How's marriage been treating you, big girl?</string>
  <string id="6155691">It's been good. No, great. I'd forgotten what it was like to...</string>
  <string id="6155694">Be flipped ass over tits and hammered like a bent nail?</string>
  <string id="6155697">To. Be. Loved.</string>
  <string id="6155700">Oh. Right, of course.</string>
  <string id="6155703">Not that I'm complaining about the other thing.</string>
  <string id="6155712">So you've... been with women. In bed?</string>
  <string id="6155715">I know. Shocking, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6155718">You see, sweetness, men are only good for one thing. Women are good for six.</string>
  <string id="6155721">Six? Which six?</string>
  <string id="6155724">Isabela!</string>
  <string id="6155727">Laughs</string>
  <string id="6155733">That book you were reading this morning, Hessarian's Spear—I don't think he had a spear in the legends.</string>
  <string id="6155736">He does in this one. Read the description.</string>
  <string id="6155739">Andraste knelt before no man but her Maker, but she hadn't counted on the archon Hessarian.</string>
  <string id="6155742">Can Hessarian penetrate the tight-knit defenses of the warrior-prophetess? Will she be prepared to face the full blast of his... power?</string>
  <string id="6155745">Wait a minute... Isabela! This is a vulgar thing!</string>
  <string id="6155748">You want to borrow it?</string>
  <string id="6155751">No!</string>
  <string id="6155754">You sure? It has pictures!</string>
  <string id="6155757">Not listening! I'm not listening!</string>
  <string id="6155766">You look like a man I once dueled.</string>
  <string id="6155769">He was a little intimidated by my reputation as a vicious pirate, but rose to the challenge.</string>
  <string id="6155772">He looked like me, you say?</string>
  <string id="6155775">It went on all night, under the stars, the waves lapping at our ankles.</string>
  <string id="6155778">On the beach? In the surf? How did you get proper footing?</string>
  <string id="6155781">We didn't. There was quite a bit of tumbling around, and we were soaked and sore by the time the sun came up.</string>
  <string id="6155784">Did you... win?</string>
  <string id="6155787">I managed to get on top in the end, but I considered it a tie.</string>
  <string id="6155796">Why is it always about sex with you?</string>
  <string id="6155799">It's not. Sometimes it's about sex with other people.</string>
  <string id="6155802">You see? It comes up every single time we talk.</string>
  <string id="6155805">We're just talking, Carver. If it comes up, that's not my fault.</string>
  <string id="6155808">What? I mean... that's not what I meant. It... it doesn't!</string>
  <string id="6155811">I hate you so much.</string>
  <string id="6155820">So you freed a group of slaves.</string>
  <string id="6155823">Would-be slaves. They weren't slaves yet.</string>
  <string id="6155826">Still, you did the right thing. Many would turn a blind eye.</string>
  <string id="6155829">Don't read too much into it, all right? It just seemed a good idea at the time.</string>
  <string id="6155835">So what's with that magical fisting thing you do?</string>
  <string id="6155838">I'm... sorry?</string>
  <string id="6155841">You know, when you stick your hand into people.</string>
  <string id="6155844">Oh. That. Yes. It's a... talent.</string>
  <string id="6155847">You could make so much coin with that.</string>
  <string id="6155853">This one time, I was sailing to Llomerryn, and there was a fight between two of my men.</string>
  <string id="6155856">It was over a dice game, or the last piece of toast, or something. Sailors—they're touchy about their toast.</string>
  <string id="6155859">Is this going anywhere?</string>
  <string id="6155862">It will if you let me finish.</string>
  <string id="6155865">So, there's a knife fight, and Jim ends up with a broken-off blade stuck in his shoulder.</string>
  <string id="6155868">It's buried deep in there, and we're out at sea, at least a week from the nearest port.</string>
  <string id="6155871">If you were there, you could've reached in and plucked that blade right from his flesh.</string>
  <string id="6155874">That's your whole point?</string>
  <string id="6155877">Pretty much.</string>
  <string id="6155883">So I hear you think mages should be free.</string>
  <string id="6155886">Everyone should be free. Not just mages.</string>
  <string id="6155889">Not everyone's dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6155892">It's not about who's dangerous. It's about having choices made for you.</string>
  <string id="6155895">Don't you wish you had the choice not to have lyrium stuck under your skin?</string>
  <string id="6155898">I do.</string>
  <string id="6155901">Sighs This is silly. I don't want to argue.</string>
  <string id="6155907">You seem especially broody today.</string>
  <string id="6155910">Does it bother you? Should I stop?</string>
  <string id="6155913">No, don't stop. But could you add some smoldering to the routine? Just for me.</string>
  <string id="6155916">Smolder?</string>
  <string id="6155919">Oh, and while you're at it, perhaps some cold insolence.</string>
  <string id="6155922">You want me to smolder and be cold at the same time? Those don't go together...</string>
  <string id="6155925">Shush. Don't distract me with your logic.</string>
  <string id="6155931">That night... I can't stop thinking about it.</string>
  <string id="6155934">Well, then I'll see you later.</string>
  <string id="6155937">That was direct.</string>
  <string id="6155940">Thought I'd get straight to the point. Were you expecting flowers or something?</string>
  <string id="6155943">Don't be absurd.</string>
  <string id="6155946">Then I'll see you tonight.</string>
  <string id="6155955">Rivaini, stop looking at my chest. My eyes are up here.</string>
  <string id="6155958">But the chest hair...</string>
  <string id="6155961">Do you know how much I suffer under your gaze? I am a person, not an object!</string>
  <string id="6155964">Uh, Varric?</string>
  <string id="6155967">Laughs Just shitting you.</string>
  <string id="6155973">I'll let you run your fingers through it, if you want.</string>
  <string id="6155976">Your chest hair? My fingers? Oh, Varric, stop! You're making me quiver.</string>
  <string id="6155979">You know you want to.</string>
  <string id="6155982">Oh, I do... I can't resist you. No woman can.</string>
  <string id="6155985">I know. It's a terrible burden.</string>
  <string id="6155991">Come to me, and I'll take you to places you've never been...</string>
  <string id="6155994">Isabela... Are you talking to Bianca?</string>
  <string id="6155997">I think she deserves to feel a woman's touch on her trigger, don't you?</string>
  <string id="6156000">Bianca responds to my touch. She'd never give it up for you.</string>
  <string id="6156003">That's what they always say, and I always prove them wrong.</string>
  <string id="6156006">Stop it. You're confusing her. And me.</string>
  <string id="6156012">Psst. I've got some of it written down now.</string>
  <string id="6156015">Give it here.</string>
  <string id="6156018">Her breasts strained against the leather jerkin like two wild stallions corralled against their will. Chuckles</string>
  <string id="6156021">She pounced—the smooth moves of a jungle cat—and locked her thighs around Donnic's waist. He—</string>
  <string id="6156024">What?</string>
  <string id="6156027">Nothing.</string>
  <string id="6156030">What is that?</string>
  <string id="6156033">Shh! Giggles</string>
  <string id="6156036">Isabela just thought she'd celebrate your love affair with a... written dedication.</string>
  <string id="6156039">It's friend-fiction! I do it out of love!</string>
  <string id="6156042">I will never, ever be clean again.</string>
  <string id="6156045">Maybe you should read the rest of it in private.</string>
  <string id="6156048">I think that's best.</string>
  <string id="6156054">Varric, how does one get made a Paragon?</string>
  <string id="6156057">The Assembly votes on it. Enough votes, and—BAM!—you're a living god.</string>
  <string id="6156060">You should ask to be made a Paragon. Of manliness.</string>
  <string id="6156063">I like the way you think, Rivaini, but one doesn't just ask to be made a Paragon.</string>
  <string id="6156066">Why not? Everyone can see you're a paragon of manliness. It's just a matter of making it official.</string>
  <string id="6156072">After all this, the life of a pirate's going to be a bit dull, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6156081">I know! I'll have to steal myself another Qunari relic.</string>
  <string id="6156092">Do you really like sailing?</string>
  <string id="6156095">Like it? I love it! The salt spray on my face, the wind whipping by my ears, the gulls screaming overhead—I love it all.</string>
  <string id="6156098">Don't you get sick? I was so sick on our trip across the sea.</string>
  <string id="6156101">Were you in the hold?</string>
  <string id="6156104">Everyone was in the hold.</string>
  <string id="6156107">There's your problem. You need to be up on deck, under the sky, with nothing between you and the horizon.</string>
  <string id="6156110">Sailing is like sex. Do it wrong, and it'll make you sick.</string>
  <string id="6156113">But do it right, and there's no feeling in the world like it.</string>
  <string id="6156119">It's not always fun and games on the sea, though. There are storms and hostile pirates.</string>
  <string id="6156146">And it's trying being cooped up with men who haven't seen a woman in months.</string>
  <string id="6156149">You're a woman.</string>
  <string id="6156152">Exactly. And I don't usually let them touch me, so they get... frustrated.</string>
  <string id="6156155">I insist all of them get alone time. Helps with the crankiness.</string>
  <string id="6156158">But they're already lonely! Why would you insist that they be alone some more?</string>
  <string id="6156161">Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6156164">What? Did I miss something?</string>
  <string id="6156167">Go think about it. Maybe it'll come to you.</string>
  <string id="6156173">You and Hawke... something's there, isn't there?</string>
  <string id="6156176">She's so amazing and beautiful. How could anyone not love her?</string>
  <string id="6156179">He's clever, strong, wonderful. How could anyone not love him?</string>
  <string id="6156182">How could anyone not?</string>
  <string id="6156185">You're very quiet today. Is something wrong?</string>
  <string id="6156188">Gasps It's me. I said something wrong, didn't I?</string>
  <string id="6156191">No, of course not! You could never say anything wrong.</string>
  <string id="6156194">I'm happy for you, Kitten. You've been alone long enough.</string>
  <string id="6156197">Oh, I could give you a list, but that might just bore you.</string>
  <string id="6156200">So... did you get naked?</string>
  <string id="6156203">Isabela!</string>
  <string id="6156206">Ooh, look at that blush. That good, huh?</string>
  <string id="6156212">Sighs Why do you even like me? I must seem so dull.</string>
  <string id="6156215">What brought this on?</string>
  <string id="6156218">Your life has been... so exciting. The adventures, the duels, the passionate love affairs.</string>
  <string id="6156221">Compared to that, my life is a stale, dry biscuit. Sighs I wish I had your life.</string>
  <string id="6156224">No. You don't want my life.</string>
  <string id="6156227">Why?</string>
  <string id="6156230">Because you have a good heart, and you deserve better.</string>
  <string id="6156236">You've had many lovers, haven't you?</string>
  <string id="6156239">Fewer than some think.</string>
  <string id="6156242">But you never stay with them.</string>
  <string id="6156245">No, why should I?</string>
  <string id="6156248">But the act of lovemaking is so... intimate.</string>
  <string id="6156251">I don't make love. What I do is only skin-deep, Kitten.</string>
  <string id="6156254">Don't worry your pretty little head about it.</string>
  <string id="6156260">Why are you smiling?</string>
  <string id="6156263">No reason.</string>
  <string id="6156266">Ooh, ooh! It's something dirty, isn't it? Tell me, tell me!</string>
  <string id="6156269">It... it isn't anything dirty. I'm just... happy.</string>
  <string id="6156272">Oh. That's good, too, but I was hoping for something dirty.</string>
  <string id="6156275">Come by the tavern later. I've got stories that will make your toes curl.</string>
  <string id="6156289">It seems I must wait a bit longer for my love. Sighs. Thank you for your aid. I will find my way back to Kirkwall. </string>
  <string id="6156292">The walk will tire me, and we'll be reunited in my dreams! Feynriel my love—I'm coming!</string>
  <string id="6156298">Orlanna</string>
  <string id="6156302">Bandit Leader</string>
  <string id="6156307">Move along, Fereldan.</string>
  <string id="6156308">I could use all the allies I can get.</string>
  <string id="6156309">Give me the scroll.</string>
  <string id="6156310">Secrecy is paramount. I'll communicate by messenger if the need arises.</string>
  <string id="6156313">Maker look after you, Hawke, and our fragile endeavor.</string>
  <string id="6156316">I'm not joining your conspiracy.</string>
  <string id="6156317">Your cause is futile.</string>
  <string id="6156318">I misjudged you. Apologies.</string>
  <string id="6156321">I thought... I thought I was dead. I just let her stay the night. Th-this is madness!</string>
  <string id="6156325">Mercy, ser, mercy! I've done nothing wrong.</string>
  <string id="6156328">You harbored a known apostate.</string>
  <string id="6156331">Wh-what crime is feeding my cousin? She was whipped, half-starving.</string>
  <string id="6156334">It is a crime against the Maker. The sentence is—  Intruders! Deal with them!</string>
  <string id="6156340">You've been followed, Ser Edgert.</string>
  <string id="6156343">Wh-What? Kill them.</string>
  <string id="6156346">Gladly.</string>
  <string id="6156349">What are you looking at?</string>
  <string id="6156350">When the time comes you will have my blade, serah.</string>
  <string id="6156354">We cannot stand idly by as Meredith oversteps herself at every turn. We shall have a viscount again and return sanity to Kirkwall!</string>
  <string id="6156357">This course is foolhardy. The knight-commander will kill us all.</string>
  <string id="6156360">Edgert, you do yourself no credit. My father and my grandfather both died defending Kirkwall from aggressors.</string>
  <string id="6156363">Meredith is no different. Hawke, Lady Selbrech, you have my sword.</string>
  <string id="6156366">I warned you.</string>
  <string id="6156369">The gold convinced us of the truth of your cause, messere.</string>
  <string id="6156370">Let's help the nobbers, boys!</string>
  <string id="6156371">Keran's Father</string>
  <string id="6156376">This attack will cement their conviction. When the time comes, you will have our aid.</string>
  <string id="6156379">Take this, with our blessings. Everyone, we must go before they send more attackers!</string>
  <string id="6156384">Hoodlum</string>
  <string id="6156388">Hooligan</string>
  <string id="6156393">The barmaid sent me. What do templars want with me?</string>
  <string id="6156404">The whole city's getting so hush-hush these days.</string>
  <string id="6156408">Someone in the back rooms wants to see you, love.</string>
  <string id="6156411">Seemed a bit insistent. Sorry, the louts over there need more ale.</string>
  <string id="6156445">Sebastian</string>
  <string id="6156449">I came as promised, Serah Hawke. Together we will defeat Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6156452">Hawke. Your speech against First Enchanter Orsino was stirring.</string>
  <string id="6156455">We hope you can aid us more directly.</string>
  <string id="6156456">You seem capable enough of capturing apostates and blood mages.</string>
  <string id="6156457">You need my help?</string>
  <string id="6156458">A lone apostate or blood mage is of little consequence.</string>
  <string id="6156461">But a group of them have become organized. And many wretches in the city lend them a hand.</string>
  <string id="6156464">The commoners are merely misguided, Ser Mettin.</string>
  <string id="6156467">Regardless, these mages are proving difficult to track down.</string>
  <string id="6156468">Depending on what you need, I could be of assistance.</string>
  <string id="6156469">Maybe. What's the problem?</string>
  <string id="6156470">This hive of blood mages and their supporters know us. If we get close to them, they'll scatter like cockroaches.</string>
  <string id="6156473">But you could take them unawares.</string>
  <string id="6156476">Ser Mettin, we cannot dally. If the blood mages see us with Hawke...</string>
  <string id="6156479">Here are the details. Eliminate these threats to Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6156482">We'll send any future communications by letter.</string>
  <string id="6156485">Templar matters are not my concern.</string>
  <string id="6156486">You deal with it.</string>
  <string id="6156487">We're wasting our time here.</string>
  <string id="6156490">We will not abandon you in your hour of need.</string>
  <string id="6156491">The mage rebellion must be put down.</string>
  <string id="6156495">I can't believe... Ser Mettin.</string>
  <string id="6156498">We must go, Hawke. But we will not forget your service to the order.</string>
  <string id="6156507">Welcome back, Master Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6156508">Welcome, Mistress. Your table should be ready.</string>
  <string id="6156509">Oh, it's you.</string>
  <string id="6156510">Welcome, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6156514">Welcome to the Blooming Rose! Speak to the madam if you want service.</string>
  <string id="6156517">I am here to help you, Serah Hawke. As promised.</string>
  <string id="6156521">To think I doubted you. You have proven your worth.</string>
  <string id="6156524">A time will come when I can help you, Hawke, and I will be there.</string>
  <string id="6156527">For now, I bid you farewell.</string>
  <string id="6156533">Mettin, they've surrendered.</string>
  <string id="6156536">Our duty is clear. They all must die.</string>
  <string id="6156539">The mages, perhaps. But you can't kill the others just for helping their family and friends!</string>
  <string id="6156542">Watch me.</string>
  <string id="6156543">Your duty is to deal with mages, not simple citizens.</string>
  <string id="6156544">Mettin, stop.</string>
  <string id="6156545">We will not let you do this.</string>
  <string id="6156548">If we let them go, they'll just cause more problems later.</string>
  <string id="6156549">Mettin is right.</string>
  <string id="6156550">You two figure it out.</string>
  <string id="6156551">Not my problem.</string>
  <string id="6156552">There is no half-way here, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6156555">I will not let you do this.</string>
  <string id="6156558">At last you show your true colors, Ser Agatha. You are a traitor to the order.</string>
  <string id="6156561">Kill them. Kill them all!</string>
  <string id="6156567">Good. You've made it.</string>
  <string id="6156570">There are many innocents in there, Ser Mettin.</string>
  <string id="6156573">Innocents? Scoffs Hardly.</string>
  <string id="6156576">Let us strike now and put down these blood mages!</string>
  <string id="6156582">Come for you usual, have you, Gallard?</string>
  <string id="6156585">Stumps, Porfiria will cut you if you don't watch those hands of yours.</string>
  <string id="6156617">What'll it be, ser templar?</string>
  <string id="6156620">Mead, please.</string>
  <string id="6156623">Coming right up.</string>
  <string id="6156626">Seneschal, we've been expecting you. Your regular room is prepared for you.</string>
  <string id="6156629">Coughs Yes. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6156642">I just want to get out of here alive.</string>
  <string id="6156643">The stories they tell about the Gallows. Shudders</string>
  <string id="6156644">Quickly, before more guards come.</string>
  <string id="6156647">Terrie said she'd find a way to rescue me.</string>
  <string id="6156650">I will never forget this!</string>
  <string id="6156656">Corff! What's brought your sorry ass up to this part of town?</string>
  <string id="6156659">I can't drink at the Hanged Man. It's like kissing my sister.</string>
  <string id="6156660">And how many friends of yours have I helped rescue?</string>
  <string id="6156683">I never thought I'd say this to you, but hear, hear!</string>
  <string id="6156693">Adriano</string>
  <string id="6156695">Cerimon</string>
  <string id="6156697">Leonato</string>
  <string id="6156699">Osric</string>
  <string id="6156703">Chest</string>
  <string id="6156705">Denier</string>
  <string id="6156707">Katriela</string>
  <string id="6156709">Cora</string>
  <string id="6156713">Chest</string>
  <string id="6156715">Serendipity</string>
  <string id="6156717">Sabina's Brat</string>
  <string id="6156719">Vengeance... took me over. I couldn't stop him.</string>
  <string id="6156722">You should have done this long ago.</string>
  <string id="6156726">Primeval Ruins</string>
  <string id="6156733">It's still hard to think of this as my home.</string>
  <string id="6156734">Do you think people will ever start calling it the Hawke estate?</string>
  <string id="6156735">In my experience, sneaking out at night rarely has anything to do with evil magic. But what do I know?</string>
  <string id="6156738">I warned you!</string>
  <string id="6156739">Stay away from me!</string>
  <string id="6156740">There's a bounty on your head.</string>
  <string id="6156744">Good luck collecting it, bastard!</string>
  <string id="6156747">You won't take me alive!</string>
  <string id="6156749">What are we going to do now?</string>
  <string id="6156750">Maybe we could find some work.</string>
  <string id="6156751">We should never have come.</string>
  <string id="6156752">We need to find some food.</string>
  <string id="6156756">I don't suppose you have a begging license?</string>
  <string id="6156759">Of course! Of course!</string>
  <string id="6156760">Oh, surely do! It's around here somewhere, messere!</string>
  <string id="6156761">I'm watching you.</string>
  <string id="6156764">I'm right as rain, messere.</string>
  <string id="6156765">Don't mind me, messere.</string>
  <string id="6156766">Have you a spare coin?</string>
  <string id="6156767">Once a horror? Yes, I'm sure it's filled with flowers and sunshine and happiness now.</string>
  <string id="6156770">My back's the best part of me. What? He doesn't appreciate the view?</string>
  <string id="6156774">Hightown</string>
  <string id="6156775">Heh. I'll have to remember that line the next time I'm late.</string>
  <string id="6156782">Swap Weapons</string>
  <string id="6156786">I've got your usual ready and waiting for you upstairs, serah.</string>
  <string id="6156789">Many thanks, Madam Lusine.</string>
  <string id="6156845">I knew that was going to come up sooner or later.</string>
  <string id="6156851">Get outside, you lazy thing! You'll ruin my business!</string>
  <string id="6156855">Another bas. I have no time for you.</string>
  <string id="6156856">Someone's paying gold to see you dead.</string>
  <string id="6156857">Time to die.</string>
  <string id="6156858">That is gold you will never see.</string>
  <string id="6156865">Good day, serah.</string>
  <string id="6156866">You're looking well, serah.</string>
  <string id="6156870">No! It's not swish, swish, flick! It's swish, flick, flick! Learn how to use a broom correctly!</string>
  <string id="6156873">If you want it done a certain way, I suggest you do it yourself.</string>
  <string id="6156878">You have killed my kin. Your life is forfeit.</string>
  <string id="6156879">You stalk the antaam? Your foolishness brings your death.</string>
  <string id="6156884">My mum works here!</string>
  <string id="6156885">I can do whatever I want, you're not the boss of me!</string>
  <string id="6156888">The way people tramp mud and dirt in here, you'd think this place was a barn!</string>
  <string id="6156891">Oh, it's not that bad.</string>
  <string id="6156894">Well, you aren't the one cleaning it up everyday, are you?</string>
  <string id="6156897">Master Stumps! Can you teach me to make a shiv now? You promised!</string>
  <string id="6156898">I'm going to work for the Coterie when I grow up!</string>
  <string id="6156940">Mum says I don't have to listen to you, because she makes triple what you do.</string>
  <string id="6157076">I'm just here for the medicinal benefits.</string>
  <string id="6157080">Well, fancy meeting you here. Just... ah... here for a drink, myself.</string>
  <string id="6157084">I won't mention this to your mother if you don't.</string>
  <string id="6157087">Ask yourself not, Have I sinned? but, How am I to be forgiven?</string>
  <string id="6157090">It is in forgiveness that we shall become like Blessed Andraste and stand in the Light.</string>
  <string id="6157163">...when he suddenly realized he'd been dead all along!</string>
  <string id="6157168">The streets aren't so bad. You could hire yourself out as a mercenary. The best part of it? No rules!</string>
  <string id="6157186">...then he saw the statue's head and he knew: It was his own world! He was in the future!</string>
  <string id="6157189">...but it was the name of his sled! From when he was a little boy!</string>
  <string id="6157192">I better not have paid for this.</string>
  <string id="6157193">You don't say?</string>
  <string id="6157194">This... was definitely not what I was expecting.</string>
  <string id="6157199">You'll have to see Madam Lusine if you want service.</string>
  <string id="6157214">Me? Oh, right. Of course.</string>
  <string id="6157231">So you married a templar, huh?</string>
  <string id="6157234">What of it?</string>
  <string id="6157237">Are they all as dirty as they seem?</string>
  <string id="6157240">What?</string>
  <string id="6157243">Did he ever ask you to play the naughty mage and the hapless recruit. Maybe the secret desire demon and the upstanding knight.</string>
  <string id="6157246">That's disgusting!</string>
  <string id="6157249">I hear it's quite popular.</string>
  <string id="6157250">Do you ever miss Ferelden?</string>
  <string id="6157253">Of course! It was my home. I would never have left it willingly.</string>
  <string id="6157256">But I'm not going to be my father, waste my entire life trying to recreate what I remember.</string>
  <string id="6157259">I really didn't think I'd give it a second thought once I was gone. I mean, what did Ferelden ever do for me?</string>
  <string id="6157262">But I do. I think about it. There's something here that just doesn't feel right.</string>
  <string id="6157265">You mean how mages are treated?</string>
  <string id="6157268">No... I think there's not enough dog shit.</string>
  <string id="6157269">So, I never expected to be palling around with the captain of the guard.</string>
  <string id="6157272">We're not pals.</string>
  <string id="6157275">We're not? What about that time we painted each other's toenails?</string>
  <string id="6157278">Do you want something?</string>
  <string id="6157281">Love, life and liberty. What more does a man need?</string>
  <string id="6157284">You're in a jolly mood.</string>
  <string id="6157287">Well, when you're here, I know you're not leading men into Darktown to arrest me.</string>
  <string id="6157288">Can I ask you something, Aveline?</string>
  <string id="6157291">I cannot look the other way when mages break the law—</string>
  <string id="6157294">That's not what I was going to ask.</string>
  <string id="6157297">There's a girl. A mage apprentice. She... was murdered in the Gallows recently. Have you heard anything of it?</string>
  <string id="6157300">You mean the girl you killed.</string>
  <string id="6157303">Yes. I'd like to... attend the funeral. Do something.</string>
  <string id="6157306">The official templar report says she was killed by a demon of unknown origin.</string>
  <string id="6157309">Let her family mourn her in peace.</string>
  <string id="6157310">I suppose you're just thrilled how the Knight-Commander's basically stepped into the Viscount's seat?</string>
  <string id="6157313">It's not her place. They should have found an heir.</string>
  <string id="6157316">Templars serve the Chantry. Leaving the Viscount's seat empty will just tempt people to fight for it.</string>
  <string id="6157319">Well. You've got a brain in there after all.</string>
  <string id="6157322">I'd been convinced that headband was to keep it from falling out.</string>
  <string id="6157323">Your husband agrees with me.</string>
  <string id="6157326">About what?</string>
  <string id="6157329">He thinks the Knight-Commander's mad. He told me she's been going behind your back to investigate guardsmen she suspects as secret mages.</string>
  <string id="6157332">Why would he tell you that? When did you talk to him?</string>
  <string id="6157335">He's not going to fight for her when the time comes. Would you turn against your own husband?</string>
  <string id="6157338">You're out of your mind.</string>
  <string id="6157341">You and the knight-commander deserve each other!</string>
  <string id="6157345">Where did you learn your magic?</string>
  <string id="6157348">I mean, you know my feelings on the Circle, but usually it's the only decent training a mage can get.</string>
  <string id="6157351">My father taught me. He was in the Circle once, got his training there. But he got away.</string>
  <string id="6157354">You don't know how lucky you were, to grow up with someone who loved you and could help you. Most mages would kill for that.</string>
  <string id="6157357">He was a little like you, I think.</string>
  <string id="6157358">The Rite of Tranquility is the whole problem. If they didn't have that to hold over us, we'd have so many more options.</string>
  <string id="6157361">Right! If we want to fight back... or even just engage in intelligent debate... they make sure we can't do it anymore.</string>
  <string id="6157364">They're forcing our hands. There's no way to change things peacefully.</string>
  <string id="6157367">There must be something.</string>
  <string id="6157370">If it's Tranqulity or death, we have to choose death, we have to make every struggle a life-and-death struggle.</string>
  <string id="6157373">I know, I just... there are good people in the Circle, in the Chantry.</string>
  <string id="6157376">There has to be a way to reason with them.</string>
  <string id="6157379">Not if they take away your ability to reason.</string>
  <string id="6157383">I'm sorry about your sister. She sounds like a special girl.</string>
  <string id="6157386">Why? Because she was a mage?</string>
  <string id="6157389">Your brother says she had a good heart. She spent her life on the run but it never made her bitter.</string>
  <string id="6157392">Your other sister says she was a good person. She never turned down a chance to help the needy.</string>
  <string id="6157395">Yes, yes. I'm sure the Chantry's got a shrine with her portrait on it.</string>
  <string id="6157398">I was trying to be nice!</string>
  <string id="6157401">Stick to surly. It works for you.</string>
  <string id="6157402">What a beautiful day to be planning a nice trip into the Deep Roads, don't you think?</string>
  <string id="6157405">The blight, the dampness, the festering darkness filled with tainted rats...</string>
  <string id="6157408">Shut up.</string>
  <string id="6157411">You've got a real chip on your shoulder, you know?</string>
  <string id="6157414">I've got a big sword on my shoulder, magey.</string>
  <string id="6157417">I'd noticed that. I wonder what you're compensating for.</string>
  <string id="6157520">So, you were in the Circle and ran away. I don't know if I'd be brave enough to do that.</string>
  <string id="6157523">What do you mean? You've been an apostate your whole life.</string>
  <string id="6157526">Exactly. It was never anything I had to work for.</string>
  <string id="6157529">Other people always took all the risks to keep me free.</string>
  <string id="6157530">I know it didn't work the way you thought it would, but... I think it was brave, what you did with Justice.</string>
  <string id="6157533">It was meant well. I don't know if that's enough to forgive it.</string>
  <string id="6157536">It must have been hard for him, being trapped outside the Fade. In a place where no one's like him.</string>
  <string id="6157539">I bet he appreciated having a friend.</string>
  <string id="6157542">He did.</string>
  <string id="6157546">Was Wesley based out of the Chantry in Lothering? I don't remember ever seeing him there.</string>
  <string id="6157549">He served elsewhere. He was coming to find me at Ostagar.</string>
  <string id="6157552">Were you that familiar with every templar in Lothering?</string>
  <string id="6157555">How else was I supposed to know when to run and hide?</string>
  <string id="6157556">Being a guardsman seems like a better life than being a soldier.</string>
  <string id="6157559">Oh?</string>
  <string id="6157562">My brother was a soldier. It's all about taking land and serving some king you've never met.</string>
  <string id="6157565">Guardsmen, they do something real. They protect people. Real people. They make their lives better.</string>
  <string id="6157568">Not many people would see it that way.</string>
  <string id="6157571">Neither would my brother.</string>
  <string id="6157572">How come you and Wesley never had children? I mean, sorry if that's a personal—</string>
  <string id="6157575">It's all right.</string>
  <string id="6157578">My father always told me I was the son he'd never had. He never wanted me playing with girl things.</string>
  <string id="6157581">It was hard enough to convince myself to wear a dress at my wedding. I can't imagine being pregnant.</string>
  <string id="6157584">Now that he's gone, do you ever wish—</string>
  <string id="6157587">That's too personal.</string>
  <string id="6157591">Do you ever miss Tevinter?</string>
  <string id="6157594">I was a slave!</string>
  <string id="6157597">Still, it was your home, right? The only one you remember?</string>
  <string id="6157600">Does it ever feel strange not to be there?</string>
  <string id="6157603">Never! Sometimes. That does not mean I would go back.</string>
  <string id="6157604">So, the magister put lyrium in your skin?</string>
  <string id="6157607">So I am told.</string>
  <string id="6157610">Does it hurt?</string>
  <string id="6157613">All the time.</string>
  <string id="6157617">What were you before you were a pirate?</string>
  <string id="6157620">I had a husband. He didn't beat me, that's about the best I can say about it.</string>
  <string id="6157623">So you left him?</string>
  <string id="6157626">He was murdered. By my lover. It was all very... Antivan.</string>
  <string id="6157629">Oh. I don't think I'd like to live in Antiva.</string>
  <string id="6157633">I guess you've been with a lot of men.</string>
  <string id="6157636">Men. Women. Elves. A dwarf in drag once, but I don't recommend that.</string>
  <string id="6157639">Oh.</string>
  <string id="6157642">Aw... You're blushing! Why? How many lovers have you had?</string>
  <string id="6157645">I-I never—</string>
  <string id="6157648">You're a virgin? Hawke, you've been holding out on the poor girl! Get her a night at the Blooming Rose. On me!</string>
  <string id="6157651">That's, um, very generous.</string>
  <string id="6157654">I'm a giver.</string>
  <string id="6157658">So, there's no Circle among the Dalish?</string>
  <string id="6157661">Any child with the gift of magic is apprenticed to a Keeper. In another clan if there's no need in her own.</string>
  <string id="6157664">That sounds nice.</string>
  <string id="6157667">Magic is a gift of the Creators. Why wouldn't we use it?</string>
  <string id="6157670">It just seems... wasteful for humans to lock their mages away where they can't do anyone any good.</string>
  <string id="6157673">Of course, you're a blood mage.</string>
  <string id="6157676">Oh. Right.</string>
  <string id="6157677">But... you are a blood mage, right?</string>
  <string id="6157678">So, is the Keeper... your mother?</string>
  <string id="6157681">I left my clan when I was a child. To become Marethari's First.</string>
  <string id="6157684">I haven't seen my parents in more than ten years.</string>
  <string id="6157687">I'm so sorry! My father died in the Blight. You must really miss them.</string>
  <string id="6157690">I remember my mother singing to me, when I was a little girl and I'd get sick. I think that's what I miss the most.</string>
  <string id="6157693">The Keeper has a terrible singing voice.</string>
  <string id="6157697">You don't seem to like your brother very much.</string>
  <string id="6157700">And here I thought it took blood magic to read minds.</string>
  <string id="6157703">I had a twin brother, Carver. He used to nail my braid to the bed while I was sleeping.</string>
  <string id="6157706">I never thought I'd miss him this much.</string>
  <string id="6157709">Sorry about your brother.</string>
  <string id="6157712">Hey, you want mine? I've got a spare...</string>
  <string id="6157713">Do you ever wish you lived in Orzammar?</string>
  <string id="6157716">Great ancestors, no! You know what Orzammar is?</string>
  <string id="6157719">It's cramped tunnels, filled with nug-shit and body-odor. </string>
  <string id="6157722">And every person there thinks he's better than you because his great-great-great grandfather made a water-clock or something.</string>
  <string id="6157725">But they're your people. Don't you even wonder what it would be like?</string>
  <string id="6157728">Hey, I've got a good imagination. Why would I waste it on that?</string>
  <string id="6157738">What are you looking at, Anders?</string>
  <string id="6157741">Your sisters are... were both mages, as was your father?</string>
  <string id="6157744">Your brother is a mage. As were your sister and father?</string>
  <string id="6157747">And I'm not. What of it?</string>
  <string id="6157750">Nothing, it's not always passed to all siblings. But it is good to know you understand our plight.</string>
  <string id="6157753">Shove your plight.</string>
  <string id="6157757">You don't like me, Carver?</string>
  <string id="6157760">I don't like you.</string>
  <string id="6157763">That's unfortunate. Hating someone just because they're a mage should be a shameful thing.</string>
  <string id="6157766">I don't hate you because you're a mage. I hate you because you won't shut up about it.</string>
  <string id="6157769">Oppression this, templars that. I'd heard enough long before you.</string>
  <string id="6157772">Maybe it's time you put some thought into it.</string>
  <string id="6157779">Tell me, how did your family escape Lothering? Almost everyone who hadn't fled...</string>
  <string id="6157782">My brother. If he wasn't with us, I don't think we'd be here.</string>
  <string id="6157785">My older sister. If she wasn't with us, I don't think we'd be here.</string>
  <string id="6157788">But you seem quite skilled as well.</string>
  <string id="6157791">I'm not my brother.</string>
  <string id="6157794">I'm not my sister.</string>
  <string id="6157800">Did you approve my application?</string>
  <string id="6157803">I can't make you a guard, Carver.</string>
  <string id="6157806">We were both soldiers. Why won't they take me?</string>
  <string id="6157809">I was an officer. And I follow orders.</string>
  <string id="6157812">Laughs No you don't.</string>
  <string id="6157815">I also think of others before myself. You seem tired of that, and that's dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6157818">Just when it's not my choice. You told them not to take me, didn't you.</string>
  <string id="6157821">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6157825">I'm surprised you still travel with us, Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6157828">Carver, don't.</string>
  <string id="6157831">You're ever so busy with the guardsmen. It must be a burden to slum with the refugees.</string>
  <string id="6157834">It's oddly comforting that you insult me like I'm family.</string>
  <string id="6157837">That wasn't... no, I didn't mean that.</string>
  <string id="6157840">I know. But you should be glad that's how I took it.</string>
  <string id="6157847">You're very different from other elves.</string>
  <string id="6157850">Oh? You know them all?</string>
  <string id="6157853">No. I just... you look different, there's no denying that.</string>
  <string id="6157856">It is what I am. And unlike the problems you claim to have, I really did have no choice.</string>
  <string id="6157859">Do we know anyone who isn't brooding every hour of the day?</string>
  <string id="6157862">Like attracts like, it seems.</string>
  <string id="6157866">You know, Fenris, I have a tattoo.</string>
  <string id="6157869">You have a what?</string>
  <string id="6157872">A tattoo. A lot of us got them before Ostagar. It's a mabari. For strength.</string>
  <string id="6157875">Does it curse you with the ability to reach into a man and tear out his insides?</string>
  <string id="6157878">Uh. I can make it bark.</string>
  <string id="6157881">Please don't.</string>
  <string id="6157884">Seconded.</string>
  <string id="6157887">Yes. Refrain.</string>
  <string id="6157890">Agreed.</string>
  <string id="6157893">Rather see it wag.</string>
  <string id="6157896">That's... eww.</string>
  <string id="6157906">So, Isabela. You captained a ship? That's a lot of men under you. In your command.</string>
  <string id="6157909">Well aren't you just adorable fumbling for a topic.</string>
  <string id="6157912">You say that like I'm harmless.</string>
  <string id="6157915">As harmless as a pup that will someday grow into its fangs and sink them deep.</string>
  <string id="6157918">Sure, keep teasing. I'll show you how much of a pup I am.</string>
  <string id="6157921">I know. That's why I do it.</string>
  <string id="6157925">I saw you at the Blooming Rose the other night.</string>
  <string id="6157928">What? No you didn't.</string>
  <string id="6157931">I suppose someone else stole your chin to romance Faith.</string>
  <string id="6157934">Pfft. That's unlikely, she wasn't even working.</string>
  <string id="6157937">Mm hmm. Got you.</string>
  <string id="6157940">Carver!</string>
  <string id="6157943">Oh ho! Nicely done.</string>
  <string id="6157946">I don't get it.</string>
  <string id="6157949">Carver, I'm shocked.</string>
  <string id="6157952">You're just... that's not what I... Shit!</string>
  <string id="6157959">So, you're not like a lot of other girls.</string>
  <string id="6157962">No, I'm an elf.</string>
  <string id="6157965">Right. All right then.</string>
  <string id="6157968">Oh! You were trying... was that dirty? Did I miss something dirty?</string>
  <string id="6157971">What? No! It wasn't dirty. It wasn't anything.</string>
  <string id="6157974">Oh. Right.</string>
  <string id="6157977">Because I miss a lot of dirty things and sometimes I wouldn't mind to hear them. Nervous Laugh</string>
  <string id="6157980">Would you now?</string>
  <string id="6157984">Your people came a long way, Merrill, but I'd like to think we have Ferelden in common.</string>
  <string id="6157987">I never saw Lothering. Did you walk as much as we did? Probably more, you didn't start with halla. Our ship stunk.</string>
  <string id="6157990">Your ship?</string>
  <string id="6157993">There was something foul in the hold. I can still smell it.</string>
  <string id="6157996">Oh. Well, that must have been unpleasant.</string>
  <string id="6157999">It was.</string>
  <string id="6158002">Did I miss another dirty thing?</string>
  <string id="6158005">No!</string>
  <string id="6158012">Varric.</string>
  <string id="6158015">Carver.</string>
  <string id="6158018">Still claiming you're helping while burying us in debt to your brother?</string>
  <string id="6158021">Still riding side-saddle while bitching at your betters?</string>
  <string id="6158024">Drinks later?</string>
  <string id="6158027">Never miss 'em.</string>
  <string id="6158031">Stop watching me, Varric.</string>
  <string id="6158034">What's your issue now, little Hawke?</string>
  <string id="6158037">Don't call... just don't, all right? You're looking for fodder for your stories.</string>
  <string id="6158040">You think you're that interesting?</string>
  <string id="6158043"> I have enough trouble being overshadowed as it is.</string>
  <string id="6158046">I don't need to get caught under an imaginary me, too.</string>
  <string id="6158049">Don't you worry. I'm not in the business of lullabies or children's stories.</string>
  <string id="6158061">Did I hear correctly? You are an abomination?</string>
  <string id="6158064">Why don't you shout it out? I don't think everyone heard you.</string>
  <string id="6158067">Do you see yourself as harmless, then? An abomination who would never harm anyone?</string>
  <string id="6158070">You mean like ripping someone's heart out of their chest?</string>
  <string id="6158073">I did that at the behest of no demon.</string>
  <string id="6158076">So it doesn't take a demon for someone to be a terrible killer? Good we agree.</string>
  <string id="6158082">What did your friend do to be made tranquil? Do you know?</string>
  <string id="6158085">No, and it doesn't matter. Nobody deserves that.</string>
  <string id="6158088">I know some mages who deserve that.</string>
  <string id="6158091">Really? So what if they started making slaves tranquil? Then they wouldn't dream of escape! Wouldn't that be wonderful?</string>
  <string id="6158094">A slave does not attract demons that try to possess him.</string>
  <string id="6158097">Which clearly justifies it? What a wonderful solution!</string>
  <string id="6158103">You should have lived in Tevinter. You'd be happier, there.</string>
  <string id="6158106">From the sounds of it, you're probably right.</string>
  <string id="6158109">There your magic would be a mark of honor. Apprenticed to the right magister you would do well.</string>
  <string id="6158112">Is there a down side?</string>
  <string id="6158115">Only if you don't mind owning a few slaves and performing the occasional blood ritual.</string>
  <string id="6158118">So they all do those things?</string>
  <string id="6158121">Only the ones who don't complain about how powerless and persecuted they are.</string>
  <string id="6158127">I seem to recall you saying something a few years ago...</string>
  <string id="6158130">Shut up.</string>
  <string id="6158133">I can control it. Isn't that what you said?</string>
  <string id="6158136">So help me...</string>
  <string id="6158142">You must see by now what an injustice the templars are, I hope.</string>
  <string id="6158145">Must I see that? I see templars trying to control what they have good reason to fear.</string>
  <string id="6158148">But they go too far.</string>
  <string id="6158151">Ask Hawke what happened to his mother, and who went too far.</string>
  <string id="6158154">Ask Hawke what happened to her mother, and who went too far.</string>
  <string id="6158157">You can't hold all mages responsible for that!</string>
  <string id="6158160">It doesn't take all mages to cause this. It only takes the weak.</string>
  <string id="6158166">Not all mages are weak.</string>
  <string id="6158169">That's true. Hawke is not weak, for instance.</string>
  <string id="6158172">That's true. Bethany was not weak, for instance.</string>
  <string id="6158175">I notice you specifically do not mention me.</string>
  <string id="6158178">That's true.</string>
  <string id="6158181">I am not weak, either. I'll prove it to you.</string>
  <string id="6158184">Prove it to yourself. You're convincing no-one.</string>
  <string id="6158193">You are... living with Hawke, now?</string>
  <string id="6158196">What's it to you?</string>
  <string id="6158199">Be good to him. Break his heart and I will kill you.</string>
  <string id="6158202">Be good to her. Break her heart and I will kill you.</string>
  <string id="6158211">I understand you're named after a famous knight?</string>
  <string id="6158214">Not this again. Everyone always brings up the name.</string>
  <string id="6158217">I've not heard of Ser Aveline before. Is she very famous?</string>
  <string id="6158220">Really? They don't tell of her glorious downfall in Tevinter?</string>
  <string id="6158223">Not to slaves.</string>
  <string id="6158226">Pardon me for saying so, then, but thank the Maker for that.</string>
  <string id="6158232">You do not like your name?</string>
  <string id="6158235">My name is a wish my father made. And I did want to be a knight, but...</string>
  <string id="6158238">I see. Still, it's a good name. A strong name.</string>
  <string id="6158241">What were you named after?</string>
  <string id="6158244">I don't know what my real name is. My master called me Fenris, his little wolf.</string>
  <string id="6158247">Could you not call yourself something different now?</string>
  <string id="6158250">Couldn't you?</string>
  <string id="6158253">A fine point.</string>
  <string id="6158259">So it must feel good to be captain of the guard, yes?</string>
  <string id="6158262">No, I will not change the patrols around your mansion again. There's already been too many questions.</string>
  <string id="6158265">You wound my pride with such accusations.</string>
  <string id="6158268">But you were going to ask.</string>
  <string id="6158271">Eventually.</string>
  <string id="6158274">Laughs I'll take a look at the roster and see what I can do.</string>
  <string id="6158280">I was speaking to Donnic the other day...</string>
  <string id="6158283">Since when do you speak to my husband?</string>
  <string id="6158286">He... comes to the mansion once a week? We play diamondback.</string>
  <string id="6158289">What? And why am I not invited to these games?</string>
  <string id="6158292">He says you get angry when you lose.</string>
  <string id="6158295">I do not! All right, perhaps I do. That's no reason not to tell me.</string>
  <string id="6158298">Perhaps he longed for less masculine companionship?</string>
  <string id="6158301">Shut up, whore.</string>
  <string id="6158304">It is if he's a betting man.</string>
  <string id="6158307">I disavow all knowledge of gambling occurring in my household.</string>
  <string id="6158310">He's a good man, Aveline. I enjoy his visits.</string>
  <string id="6158313">Fine, fine. Have your man time, then.</string>
  <string id="6158319">I wanted to thank you for that tip you gave me, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6158322">You caught them, then?</string>
  <string id="6158325">Slave runners working out of the Undercity, yes. A whole nest.</string>
  <string id="6158328">I imagine you imprisoned them?</string>
  <string id="6158331">They never made it to prison, sadly. Not that I gave them the option.</string>
  <string id="6158334">You always know how to make me smile, Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6158343">You've been an apostate your whole life, then?</string>
  <string id="6158346">Like my father before me. What of it?</string>
  <string id="6158349">Didn't your family consider that dangerous?</string>
  <string id="6158352">There are mages who go through their whole lives without ever falling prey to a demon. Many of them, in fact.</string>
  <string id="6158355">And if the templars came looking for you? That would not be danger enough?</string>
  <string id="6158358">Perhaps there shouldn't be any templars.</string>
  <string id="6158364">You know, you cannot wish the templars away.</string>
  <string id="6158367">I can try.</string>
  <string id="6158370">Is the Circle here truly so terrible an option?</string>
  <string id="6158373">Do you really have to ask that?</string>
  <string id="6158376">You would be kept safe-- from others, as well as from yourself. And they would be kept safe from you.</string>
  <string id="6158379">I... didn't ask for this.</string>
  <string id="6158382">Nobody asks for their fate.</string>
  <string id="6158391">So... this master of yours wants your markings back? Skin and all?</string>
  <string id="6158394">So his hunters told me. Unwillingly.</string>
  <string id="6158397">So why not cover them up? Wouldn't that make you harder to find?</string>
  <string id="6158400">Let them come. I am not one to hide.</string>
  <string id="6158403">Still, if it were me--</string>
  <string id="6158406">It's not.</string>
  <string id="6158412">So you've really never thought of hiding from those hunters?</string>
  <string id="6158415">To what end?</string>
  <string id="6158418">So you could, I don't know, have a life?</string>
  <string id="6158421">What life do you have? There are no hunters after you at all.</string>
  <string id="6158424">I have a life!</string>
  <string id="6158427">One that you complain about. We are not always free to do as we wish, as you should well know.</string>
  <string id="6158430">I do have a life.</string>
  <string id="6158433">Then I stand corrected.</string>
  <string id="6158442">I enjoy a man with markings like that.</string>
  <string id="6158445">You've enjoyed many, I suspect.</string>
  <string id="6158448">Where I come from, they're called tattoos. Sailors get them all the time.</string>
  <string id="6158451">Not made of lyrium, I'd imagine.</string>
  <string id="6158454">Not a one. And the pictures are different-- usually breasts.</string>
  <string id="6158457">I suppose a pair of lyrium breasts tattooed onto my chest would make things better.</string>
  <string id="6158460">That's me. I'm a helper.</string>
  <string id="6158466">So this relic you mentioned losing...</string>
  <string id="6158469">You have pretty eyes.</string>
  <string id="6158472">I... have pretty eyes.</string>
  <string id="6158475">You elves have such pretty eyes, even the men. It makes me want to pluck them out and wear them as a necklace.</string>
  <string id="6158478">I wouldn't suggest trying.</string>
  <string id="6158481">Oh, I would never try. Not without reason, of course.</string>
  <string id="6158484">Forget I said anything.</string>
  <string id="6158490">You keep staring at me. Is it my eyes again?</string>
  <string id="6158493">You're very lanky, for an elf. I like lanky.</string>
  <string id="6158496">From what I gather, you like a lot of things.</string>
  <string id="6158499">Nonsense. But when I see something I like, I go after it.</string>
  <string id="6158502">I suggest keeping your distance.</string>
  <string id="6158505">Now you're just making it challenging.</string>
  <string id="6158508">Do you intend to go after me, then?</string>
  <string id="6158511">Will you take off all that spiky armor you're wearing?</string>
  <string id="6158514">It's been known to happen.</string>
  <string id="6158517">Then forget it.</string>
  <string id="6158523">So what duties did you have? As a slave, I mean?</string>
  <string id="6158526">Not this again.</string>
  <string id="6158529">I heard that Tevinter slaves are kept oiled so they glisten. Did your master oil you up? Did you glisten for him?</string>
  <string id="6158532">I was his bodyguard.</string>
  <string id="6158535">Always close at hand. Always within reach. Glistening.</string>
  <string id="6158538">You have an entire story written in your head already, don't you?</string>
  <string id="6158541">Mmmm.</string>
  <string id="6158547">So you engaged a Qunari dreadnought in battle?</string>
  <string id="6158550">They engaged me in battle. I was just trying to get away.</string>
  <string id="6158553">Sailing into the storm was a gamble. Took care of the dreadnaught, but it did us in too. Can't win them all.</string>
  <string id="6158556">Where I come from, we would call that insanity.</string>
  <string id="6158559">Nothing ventured, nothing gained.</string>
  <string id="6158565">I still can't believe Hawke saved you.</string>
  <string id="6158568">You've been saying that for years. Would you have turned me over to the qunari?</string>
  <string id="6158571">No, but I know what they do to their prisoners.</string>
  <string id="6158574">Execute them horribly, I imagine.</string>
  <string id="6158577">The qunari waste nothing. They would re-educate you into a loyal follower of the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6158580">Pfft. Could I refuse?</string>
  <string id="6158583">There's always qamek, which turns you into a mindless laborer. Like I said, they waste nothing.</string>
  <string id="6158586">Oh.</string>
  <string id="6158589">If you wish to thank Hawke, he's standing right there.</string>
  <string id="6158592">If you wish to thank Hawke, she's standing right there.</string>
  <string id="6158601">Why are you watching me like that?</string>
  <string id="6158604">You have vallaslin. The same markings that the Dalish have.</string>
  <string id="6158607">Yours are not made of lyrium.</string>
  <string id="6158610">No, they're made of blood. Our blood. That's what vallaslin means: blood-writing. It's a mark of adulthood.</string>
  <string id="6158613">Mine were carved into my flesh against my will, in a ritual I remember only for the agony it caused me.</string>
  <string id="6158616">I'm... so sorry.</string>
  <string id="6158622">I don't want your pity.</string>
  <string id="6158625">Are you talking to me?</string>
  <string id="6158628">You said you were sorry about the ritual I endured. Keep your sorrow.</string>
  <string id="6158631">I only meant--</string>
  <string id="6158634">You have all the freedom none of our kind enjoy, and you throw it away. On what? </string>
  <string id="6158637">Our people need to reclaim their heritage.</string>
  <string id="6158640">A heritage of defeat? To what end?</string>
  <string id="6158643">Would you truly turn your back on your own history? There's so much we don't know...</string>
  <string id="6158646">It's not my history. It's simply history.</string>
  <string id="6158652">You never come to the alienage, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6158655">I don't live in the alienage.</string>
  <string id="6158658">Don't you care about the plight of our people? Not even a little bit?</string>
  <string id="6158661">I don't need to visit the alienage to know what they suffer. I know it better than you.</string>
  <string id="6158664">I've lived there for years! I see it first-hand!</string>
  <string id="6158667">And I lived it.</string>
  <string id="6158673">Avert your eyes, witch.</string>
  <string id="6158676">You said I was dwelling on useless history, but what are you doing?</string>
  <string id="6158679">The past is important, to you and to all of us. We must know it to move forward.</string>
  <string id="6158682">Yet I have made no deal with a demon to learn of my past.</string>
  <string id="6158685">You had a life. You had a family. And you abandoned them to chase after ghosts.</string>
  <string id="6158688">We are nothing alike. Don't even begin to think that we are.</string>
  <string id="6158694">You are more naive than I thought.</string>
  <string id="6158697">What have I done to you now?</string>
  <string id="6158700">To me? Nothing. Not yet.</string>
  <string id="6158703">To yourself-- you can't even begin to imagine the number of mages that have walked down the path you're now on.</string>
  <string id="6158706">My clan didn't believe in me. If you don't believe in me either, I won't mind.</string>
  <string id="6158712">Your master must have been a terrible man, to make you hate mages so.</string>
  <string id="6158715">He is a terrible man. He's not dead.</string>
  <string id="6158718">He was. Now he's dead.</string>
  <string id="6158721">We're not all like him.</string>
  <string id="6158724">How often I hear that, and yet how often I find it's not true.</string>
  <string id="6158727">The Keepers are different. They exist to preserve the old ways, and to protect our people.</string>
  <string id="6158730">And none of them would ever fall prey to a demon. Or perform blood magic.</string>
  <string id="6158733">It's impossible to talk to you.</string>
  <string id="6158739">This... Keeper of yours. She was a friend?</string>
  <string id="6158742">She was like a mother to me. To all of us.</string>
  <string id="6158745">Then I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6158748">No you're not. She's just one more mage to you. Why would you be sorry she's dead?</string>
  <string id="6158751">I'm not sorry she's dead. I'm only sorry she died for you.</string>
  <string id="6158754">What?</string>
  <string id="6158757">Let's hope the sacrifice of someone who cared for you that much isn't wasted.</string>
  <string id="6158766">I thought all dwarves had beards. Where's yours?</string>
  <string id="6158769">I misplaced it, along with my sense of dwarven pride and my gold-plated noble caste pin.</string>
  <string id="6158772">I thought maybe it fell onto your chest.</string>
  <string id="6158775">Oh-ho! The broody elf tells a joke!</string>
  <string id="6158778">I don't brood.</string>
  <string id="6158781">Friend, if your brooding were any more impressive woman would swoon as you passed. They'd have broody babies in your honor.</string>
  <string id="6158784">You're a very odd dwarf.</string>
  <string id="6158787">And you thought I was joking about the pin.</string>
  <string id="6158793">So where's your beard, elf?</string>
  <string id="6158796">Elves don't grow beards.</string>
  <string id="6158799">Huh. I thought maybe you'd shaved it off in a fit of broody pique.</string>
  <string id="6158802">So you're a funny dwarf.</string>
  <string id="6158808">So you found your brother.</string>
  <string id="6158811">I did! Wasn't expecting that.</string>
  <string id="6158814">I assume there was a time when you and he were friends?</string>
  <string id="6158817">With Bartrand? No, just brothers. Occasionally he wasn't insufferable.</string>
  <string id="6158820">And yet you remained at his side.</string>
  <string id="6158823">Too bad he didn't do the same.</string>
  <string id="6158829">You know, if you need advice on how to lay low I can give you some.</string>
  <string id="6158832">Being short would make for an excellent start, I suspect.</string>
  <string id="6158835">Keep that up, serah, and you can keep on hiding like a rank amateur.</string>
  <string id="6158838">What would you suggest, Varric? Cower in the shadows like a rat?</string>
  <string id="6158841">You could try wearing something that didn't scream I hate you all I was a slave.</string>
  <string id="6158844">The markings would still show.</string>
  <string id="6158847">Really? Through anything? That's... kind of cool.</string>
  <string id="6158853">So who is Bianca?</string>
  <string id="6158856">My crossbow. Say hello, Bianca.</string>
  <string id="6158859">But why Bianca? You must have named her after someone.</string>
  <string id="6158862">Nope. Mirabelle was taken.</string>
  <string id="6158865">The way you fondle your weapon is disturbing.</string>
  <string id="6158868">Hey! I'm a perfect gentleman. In public.</string>
  <string id="6158874">I notice you hardly ever comment on mages and templars and such.</string>
  <string id="6158877">It's a lot of humans in skirts. I get them mixed up.</string>
  <string id="6158880">I highly doubt that. The subject comes up all the time.</string>
  <string id="6158883">Tell me about it.</string>
  <string id="6158886">And no opinion? One way or the other?</string>
  <string id="6158889">Opinions are like testicles. You kick them hard enough, doesn't matter how many you got.</string>
  <string id="6158892">That's... something.</string>
  <string id="6158904">Hello? Is Anders there? Can I speak to Anders?</string>
  <string id="6158907">You can stop yelling now. It's always me.</string>
  <string id="6158910">Oh, good. I didn't want to talk to that other guy. You know. The stick-in-the-mud.</string>
  <string id="6158913">He can still hear you. Justice and I are one.</string>
  <string id="6158916">Anyway, you wanted to talk to me?</string>
  <string id="6158919">Not really. I just wanted to make sure it was you.</string>
  <string id="6158925">I've been thinking about it, and you seem very familiar. It's like I've seen you somewhere before.</string>
  <string id="6158928">I get that a lot.</string>
  <string id="6158931">I've even been told I resemble the King of Ferelden.</string>
  <string id="6158934">Now that you mention it... Hmm, have you ever thought about using that to make a little coin?</string>
  <string id="6158937">I know where this is going, and no.</string>
  <string id="6158940">That's a shame. There must be women out there who'd love to hold the royal sceptre, even if it's just a look-alike.</string>
  <string id="6158943">Have you ever been to the Pearl? In Denerim?</string>
  <string id="6158946">Perhaps, in another life.</string>
  <string id="6158949">I knew it! I've seen you there, haven't I?</string>
  <string id="6158952">I admit to nothing.</string>
  <string id="6158958">So this relic you lost... how is it you don't know what it is?</string>
  <string id="6158961">It was in a box.</string>
  <string id="6158964">And you didn't open it? You managed to resist the urge to open a box to see what it contained?</string>
  <string id="6158967">It was locked! It was a locked box!</string>
  <string id="6158970">That hasn't stopped you before.</string>
  <string id="6158973">What do you want me to say?</string>
  <string id="6158976">Hmm, nothing. I just found it curious, that's all.</string>
  <string id="6158982">Isabela, do you even have an opinion about the mages?</string>
  <string id="6158985">Sure, I have an opinion. I don't feel a constant need to bring it up, however.</string>
  <string id="6158988">Humor me, please.</string>
  <string id="6158991">Fine.Sighs Mages don't worry me. I don't believe the templars when they say I should be worried.</string>
  <string id="6158994">I believe I'm more likely to be shanked in a bar, than eaten by an abomination. You can hear an abomination coming a mile away.</string>
  <string id="6158997">Grrr. Arrrrgghh! Oh, is that an abomination coming to eat us? We should get out of here!</string>
  <string id="6159000">Abominations don't go, Grrr. Arrgh.</string>
  <string id="6159003">They don't? I should rethink the whole thing then.</string>
  <string id="6159009">I don't know how you live the way you do, blithely ignoring the consequences of your actions.</string>
  <string id="6159012">This is about the qunari thing, isn't it? I'm not blithely ignoring what happened. I just recognize that it happened years ago.</string>
  <string id="6159015">There's this fantastic thing called moving on. You should try it sometime.</string>
  <string id="6159018">Has it occured to you that Kirkwall is only just recovering from the qunari attack?</string>
  <string id="6159021">And you want me to... what? Flog myself daily about it?</string>
  <string id="6159024">Has it occured to you that maybe there's no justice in the world? Except for that voice you keep in your head?</string>
  <string id="6159030">There is justice in the world.</string>
  <string id="6159033">Oh, is there? You want to free the mages. Let's say you do. Let's say you kill a bunch of innocent people while doing so.</string>
  <string id="6159036">What about justice for those innocent people? Don't they deserve justice just as much as the mages?</string>
  <string id="6159039">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6159042">And then what? Where does it end?</string>
  <string id="6159045">It's like being in a bar brawl, with people continuously being drawn into the fray until no one remembers why it started.</string>
  <string id="6159048">Justice is an idea. It makes sense in a world of ideas, and not in ours.</string>
  <string id="6159057">Do men find you intimidating? What about Wesley? Did he think you were intimidating?</string>
  <string id="6159060">Isabela...</string>
  <string id="6159063">What? Too soon?</string>
  <string id="6159066">Too soon, too inappropriate, too personal. Too... everything!</string>
  <string id="6159069">Ooh, sore spot, huh?</string>
  <string id="6159072">If you don't shut up, all that's left of you will be a sore spot.</string>
  <string id="6159078">You have such pretty hair. What a lovely color.</string>
  <string id="6159081">Other children used to laugh at me for having ginger hair.</string>
  <string id="6159084">Really? Aww. I bet you were cute. Did you have pigtails?</string>
  <string id="6159087">Sometimes.</string>
  <string id="6159090">How precious! Little Aveline, running around the village with her flaming orange pigtails streaming behind her...</string>
  <string id="6159093">... the little boys all scattering and screaming for mercy as she approached.</string>
  <string id="6159096">Shut up, whore.</string>
  <string id="6159102">How did you ever get to be so successful with men? You're not that pretty.</string>
  <string id="6159105">Cast a wide enough net, and you're bound to catch something.</string>
  <string id="6159108">Laughs At least you're willing to admit it.</string>
  <string id="6159111">Trust me, I've heard Get away from me, you ugly pirate hag! more times than I care to count.</string>
  <string id="6159114">Doesn't that bother you?</string>
  <string id="6159117">Why should it? They don't know me. I know me.</string>
  <string id="6159120">If I know who I am, does it matter what other people say?</string>
  <string id="6159126">You're right.</string>
  <string id="6159129">About?</string>
  <string id="6159132">About knowing who you are.</string>
  <string id="6159135">I'm the Captain of the Guard. I'm a warrior. I'm loyal, strong and I don't look too bad naked.</string>
  <string id="6159138">Exactly. And if I called you a mannish, awkward, ball-crushing do-gooder, you'd say...?</string>
  <string id="6159141">Shut up, whore.</string>
  <string id="6159144">That's my girl.</string>
  <string id="6159150">You didn't come for my solstice dinner party.</string>
  <string id="6159153">Look at you! Dinner parties, cooking... do you have a lace apron yet, or should I get one for you?</string>
  <string id="6159156">Don't change the subject. I sent you an invitation and you didn't show up.</string>
  <string id="6159159">I thought it would be... I mean, I don't know. I just don't do family gatherings.</string>
  <string id="6159162">Besides, one day you and Donnic will have children and I'll be the last person you want around them.</string>
  <string id="6159165">Can you imagine all the awkward question's you'll have to answer? Mother, what's a slattern?</string>
  <string id="6159168">I'll just point at you and go, That's a slattern.</string>
  <string id="6159174">How's marriage been treating you, big girl?</string>
  <string id="6159177">It's been good. No, great. I'd forgotten what it was like to...</string>
  <string id="6159180">Be flipped arse over tits and hammered like a bent nail?</string>
  <string id="6159183">To. Be. Loved.</string>
  <string id="6159186">Oh. Right, of course.</string>
  <string id="6159189">Not that I'm complaining about that other thing.</string>
  <string id="6159198">So you've... been with women. In bed?</string>
  <string id="6159201">I know. Shocking, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6159204">You see, sweetness, men are only good for one thing. Women are good for six.</string>
  <string id="6159207">Six? Which six?</string>
  <string id="6159210">Isabela!</string>
  <string id="6159213">Laughs</string>
  <string id="6159219">Hessarian's Spear. That's the book you were reading this morning. I don't think Hessarian had a spear in the legends.</string>
  <string id="6159222">He does in this one. Read the description.</string>
  <string id="6159225">Andraste knelt before no man but her Maker. But she hadn't counted on the Archon Hessarian.</string>
  <string id="6159228">Can Hessarian penetrate the tight-knit defenses of the warrior-prophetess? Will she be prepared to face the full blast of his... power?</string>
  <string id="6159231">Wait a minute... Isabela! This is a vulgar thing!</string>
  <string id="6159234">You don't want to borrow it?</string>
  <string id="6159237">No!</string>
  <string id="6159240">You sure? It has pictures!</string>
  <string id="6159243">Not listening! I'm not listening!</string>
  <string id="6159252">You look like a man I once dueled.</string>
  <string id="6159255">He was a little intimidated by my reputation as a vicious pirate, but rose to the challenge.</string>
  <string id="6159258">He looked like me, you say?</string>
  <string id="6159261">It went on all night, under the stars, the waves lapping at our ankles.</string>
  <string id="6159264">On the beach? In the surf? How did you get proper footing?</string>
  <string id="6159267">We didn't. There was quite a bit of tumbling around, and we were soaked and sore by the time the sun came up.</string>
  <string id="6159270">Did you... win?</string>
  <string id="6159273">I managed to get on top towards the end, but I'd consider it a tie.</string>
  <string id="6159276">You know, when you say you're a duelist, what do you really mean?</string>
  <string id="6159282">Why is it always about sex with you?</string>
  <string id="6159285">It's not. Sometimes it's about sex with other people.</string>
  <string id="6159288">You see? It comes up, every single time we talk.</string>
  <string id="6159291">We're just talking, Carver. If it comes up, that's not my fault.</string>
  <string id="6159294">What? I mean... that's not what I meant. It... it doesn't!</string>
  <string id="6159297">I hate you so much.</string>
  <string id="6159306">So you freed a group of slaves.</string>
  <string id="6159309">Would-be slaves. They weren't slaves yet.</string>
  <string id="6159312">Still, you did the right thing. Many would turn a blind eye.</string>
  <string id="6159315">Don't read too much into it, all right? It just seemed a good idea at the time.</string>
  <string id="6159321">So what's with that magical fisting thing you do?</string>
  <string id="6159324">I'm... sorry?</string>
  <string id="6159327">You know, when you stick your hand into people.</string>
  <string id="6159330">Oh. That. Yes. It's a... talent.</string>
  <string id="6159333">You could make so much coin with that.</string>
  <string id="6159339">This one time, I was sailing to Llomerryn, and there was a fight between two of my men.</string>
  <string id="6159342">It was over a dice game, or the last piece of toast, or something. Sailors—they're touchy about their toast.</string>
  <string id="6159345">Is this going anywhere?</string>
  <string id="6159348">It will if you let me finish.</string>
  <string id="6159351">So, Jim and Hatecastle are in a knife fight, and Jim sticks Hatecastle right in the shoulder. The blade breaks off.</string>
  <string id="6159354">So now Hatecastle's got a knife-blade stuck in his shoulder, and we're out at sea.</string>
  <string id="6159357">If you were there, you could've just reached out and plucked that blade, right from his flesh.</string>
  <string id="6159360">That's your whole point?</string>
  <string id="6159363">Pretty much.</string>
  <string id="6159369">So I hear you think mages should be free.</string>
  <string id="6159372">Everyone should be free. Not just mages.</string>
  <string id="6159375">Not everyone's dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6159378">It's not about who's dangerous. It's about having choices made for you, because you were born a certain way.</string>
  <string id="6159381">Don't you wish you had a choice in whether you had lyrium stuck under your skin?</string>
  <string id="6159384">I do.</string>
  <string id="6159387">Sighs This is silly. I don't want to argue.</string>
  <string id="6159393">You seem especially broody today.</string>
  <string id="6159396">Does it bother you? Should I stop?</string>
  <string id="6159399">No, don't stop. Though I was just wondering if you could add a bit of smoulder to the brooding. Just for me.</string>
  <string id="6159402">Smoulder?</string>
  <string id="6159405">Oh, and while you're at it, perhaps throw in some cold insolence. Thanks!</string>
  <string id="6159408">You want me to smoulder and be cold at the same time? You know these things don't go together?</string>
  <string id="6159411">Shush. Don't distract me with your logic.</string>
  <string id="6159417">That night... I can't stop thinking about it.</string>
  <string id="6159420">Well then, I'll see you later.</string>
  <string id="6159423">That was direct.</string>
  <string id="6159426">I thought I'd get straight to the point. Were you expecting flowers or something?</string>
  <string id="6159429">Don't be silly.</string>
  <string id="6159432">Then I'll see you tonight.</string>
  <string id="6159441">Do you really like sailing?</string>
  <string id="6159444">Like it? No. I love it. The salt spray on my face, the wind whipping by my ears, the gulls screaming overhead—I love it all.</string>
  <string id="6159447">Don't you get sick? I was so sick on our trip across the sea.</string>
  <string id="6159450">Were you in the hold?</string>
  <string id="6159453">Everyone was in the hold.</string>
  <string id="6159456">There's your problem. You need to be up on deck, under the sky, with nothing between you and the horizon.</string>
  <string id="6159459">It's like sex. Do it wrong and it'll make you sick and maybe even kill you.</string>
  <string id="6159462">But do it right and there's no feeling in the world quite like it.</string>
  <string id="6159468">It's not always fun and games on the sea though. There are storms, and hostile pirates.</string>
  <string id="6159471">And it's trying being on a ship with a bunch of men who haven't seen a woman in months.</string>
  <string id="6159474">You're a woman.</string>
  <string id="6159477">No, besides me. I don't let them touch me, so they get... frustrated.</string>
  <string id="6159480">I insist that all of them get alone time. It helps with the crankiness.</string>
  <string id="6159483">But they're already lonely! Why would you insist that they be alone some more? That's cruel!</string>
  <string id="6159486">Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6159489">What? Did I miss something?</string>
  <string id="6159492">Go think about it. Maybe it'll come to you.</string>
  <string id="6159498">You and Hawke... there's something there, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6159501">She's so amazing and beautiful... how could anyone not love her?</string>
  <string id="6159504">He's clever, strong and wonderful. How could anyone not love him?</string>
  <string id="6159507">How could anyone not?</string>
  <string id="6159510">You're very quiet today. Is something wrong?</string>
  <string id="6159513">Gasps It's me. I said something wrong, didn't I?</string>
  <string id="6159516">No, of course not! You could never say anything wrong.</string>
  <string id="6159519">I'm happy for you, Kitten. You've been alone long enough.</string>
  <string id="6159522">Oh, I could give you a list, but that might just bore you.</string>
  <string id="6159525">So... did you get naked?</string>
  <string id="6159528">Isabela!</string>
  <string id="6159531">Ooh, look at that blush. That good, huh?</string>
  <string id="6159537">Sighs Why do you even like me? I must seem so dull.</string>
  <string id="6159540">What? What brought this on?</string>
  <string id="6159543">Your... your life has been so exciting. The adventures, the duels, the passionate love-affairs.</string>
  <string id="6159546">Compared to that, my life is like a stale, dry biscuit. Sighs I wish I had your life.</string>
  <string id="6159549">No, you don't. You don't want my life.</string>
  <string id="6159552">Why?</string>
  <string id="6159555">Because you have a good heart, and you deserve better.</string>
  <string id="6159561">You've had many lovers, haven't you?</string>
  <string id="6159564">Fewer than some think.</string>
  <string id="6159567">But you never stay with them.</string>
  <string id="6159570">No, why should I?</string>
  <string id="6159573">But the act of love-making is so... intimate.</string>
  <string id="6159576">I don't make love. What I do is only skin-deep, Kitten.</string>
  <string id="6159579">Don't worry your pretty little head about it.</string>
  <string id="6159585">Why are you smiling?</string>
  <string id="6159588">No reason.</string>
  <string id="6159591">Ooh, ooh! It's something dirty, isn't it? Tell me, tell me!</string>
  <string id="6159594">It... it isn't anything dirty for once. I'm just... happy.</string>
  <string id="6159597">Oh. That's good too, but I was hoping for something dirty.</string>
  <string id="6159600">Come by the tavern later. I've got stories that will make your toes curl.</string>
  <string id="6159609">Rivaini, stop looking at my chest. My eyes are up here.</string>
  <string id="6159612">But the chest hair...</string>
  <string id="6159615">Do you know how much I suffer under your gaze? I am a person, not an object!</string>
  <string id="6159618">Uh, Varric?</string>
  <string id="6159621">Laughs Just shitting you. Ogle away, Sunshine.</string>
  <string id="6159627">I'll let you run your fingers through it, if you want.</string>
  <string id="6159630">Your chest hair? My fingers? Oh, Varric, stop. You're making me quiver.</string>
  <string id="6159633">You know you want to.</string>
  <string id="6159636">Oh, I do... I can't resist you. No woman can.</string>
  <string id="6159639">I know. It's a terrible burden, but someone has to bear it.</string>
  <string id="6159645">Oh, yes, come to me and I'll take you to places you've never been...</string>
  <string id="6159648">Isabela. Are you talking to Bianca?</string>
  <string id="6159651">I think she deserves to feel a woman's touch on her trigger, don't you?</string>
  <string id="6159654">Bianca responds to my touch. She'd never give it up for you.</string>
  <string id="6159657">That's what they always say. And I always prove them wrong.</string>
  <string id="6159660">Stop it. You're confusing her. And me.</string>
  <string id="6159666">Psst. I've got some of it written down now.</string>
  <string id="6159669">Give it here.</string>
  <string id="6159672">Her breasts strained against the leather jerkin, like two wild stallions corralled against their will. Chuckles</string>
  <string id="6159675">She pounced—the smooth moves of a jungle cat—and locked her thighs around Donnic's waist. He—</string>
  <string id="6159678">What?</string>
  <string id="6159681">Nothing.</string>
  <string id="6159684">What is that?</string>
  <string id="6159687">Shh! Giggles</string>
  <string id="6159690">Isabela just thought she'd celebrate your love-affair with a... written dedication.</string>
  <string id="6159693">It's friend-fiction! I do it out of love!</string>
  <string id="6159696">I feel like I will never, ever be clean again.</string>
  <string id="6159699">Maybe you should read the rest of it in private.</string>
  <string id="6159702">I think that's best.</string>
  <string id="6159708">Varric, how does one get made a Paragon?</string>
  <string id="6159711">The Assembly votes on it. If you get enough votes—BAM!—you're a living god.</string>
  <string id="6159714">You should ask to be made a Paragon. Of manliness.</string>
  <string id="6159717">I like the way you think, Rivaini. But one doesn't just ask to be made a Paragon.</string>
  <string id="6159720">Why not?  Everyone can see you're a paragon of manliness, it's just a matter of making it official.</string>
  <string id="6159726">After all this, going back to the life of a pirate's going to be a little dull, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6159729">You have a point. I might have to kidnap the queen of Antiva to amuse myself.</string>
  <string id="6159732">And which part of that would you find amusing? The kidnapping, or the queen?</string>
  <string id="6159735">The kidnapping. I hear the queen's a sour-faced toad.</string>
  <string id="6160605">I hear good things about you, Anders. Not what I expected.</string>
  <string id="6160608">From a mage, you mean.</string>
  <string id="6160611">I didn't say that.</string>
  <string id="6160614">How else would you judge me? What else am I a shining example of?</string>
  <string id="6160617">I don't know... other Fereldans lurking in Darktown? Mage or not.</string>
  <string id="6160620">You... have a fair point.</string>
  <string id="6160624">I could use your consult, Anders.</string>
  <string id="6160627">Bring it to Darktown, and I'll get you a salve or something.</string>
  <string id="6160630">What? No! I need to know some things about mages.</string>
  <string id="6160633">Why?</string>
  <string id="6160636">I'm a guard. I'm the first person who has to deal with... trouble.</string>
  <string id="6160639">You want help killing people like me.</string>
  <string id="6160642">Not every mage can be trusted.</string>
  <string id="6160645">Nor every guard.</string>
  <string id="6160649">You're glaring, Anders. Is there a reason, or is it one of your moods?</string>
  <string id="6160652">Your term as captain hasn't been particularly mage friendly.</string>
  <string id="6160655">I've only turned a handful over to the templars.</string>
  <string id="6160658">Every despot starts somewhere.</string>
  <string id="6160661">And yet I allow an abomination to whine at me! Credit where it's due.</string>
  <string id="6160665">So you're two people, Anders and... Justice?</string>
  <string id="6160668">That's not strictly accurate.</string>
  <string id="6160671">But you are of two minds.</string>
  <string id="6160674">Many people are.</string>
  <string id="6160677">Now you're the one not being accurate.</string>
  <string id="6160680">I thought those were the rules of this game.</string>
  <string id="6160683">I never know who I'm talking to with you.</string>
  <string id="6160686">Then it's fortunate it doesn't occur often.</string>
  <string id="6160690">I have to admit, Anders. Of the mages I know, you're the one I expected to go out in a blaze.</string>
  <string id="6160693">The day is young.</string>
  <string id="6160696">It was a compliment, you ass.</string>
  <string id="6160699">No, it wasn't.</string>
  <string id="6160730">Out of your element, Bethany?</string>
  <string id="6160733">I thought Kirkwall would be a new start, but it seems like such an unforgiving place.</string>
  <string id="6160736">It's changed hands more than once. They're careful about their borders.</string>
  <string id="6160739">It's hard to think of us as that kind of threat.</string>
  <string id="6160742">Looked at your sister lately?</string>
  <string id="6160745">Looked at your brother lately?</string>
  <string id="6160748">There is that.</string>
  <string id="6160752">You show admirable restraint, Bethany.</string>
  <string id="6160755">For a mage, you mean.</string>
  <string id="6160758">I could also say for a Hawke, but yes, for a mage.</string>
  <string id="6160761">You have a sword. Why aren't you killing someone right now?</string>
  <string id="6160764">Fair point, but I can put my sword down.</string>
  <string id="6160767">Believe me, I have tried.</string>
  <string id="6160771">I'm sorry I couldn't get you more information about the Circle, Bethany. It's difficult without naming you.</string>
  <string id="6160774">Thank you for being discreet. I don't want the templars at my door.</string>
  <string id="6160777">No one does.</string>
  <string id="6160780">Let them corral the troublemakers. I just want information.</string>
  <string id="6160783">Right. Right.</string>
  <string id="6160786">It sounds like I'm trying to convince myself, doesn't it?</string>
  <string id="6160789">I wouldn't have said. But yes.</string>
  <string id="6160792">Don't worry, sweetie. You'll be fine now. No more living in the streets.</string>
  <string id="6160795">But Madam Lusine said...</string>
  <string id="6160798">Oh, that old cow never carries through on her threats. You're safe with us.</string>
  <string id="6160804">No unnecessary violence, Carver.</string>
  <string id="6160807">Tell that to my sister.</string>
  <string id="6160810">She knows. She may not listen, but she knows.</string>
  <string id="6160813">Tell that to my brother.</string>
  <string id="6160816">He knows. He may not listen, but he knows.</string>
  <string id="6160819">But I need special supervision, is that it?</string>
  <string id="6160822">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6160825">All... all right then.</string>
  <string id="6160829">I don't like some of the people you've been associating with, Carver.</string>
  <string id="6160832">Talk to my sister. She's the one in charge.</string>
  <string id="6160835">Talk to my brother. He's the one in charge.</string>
  <string id="6160838">Maybe, but I know you get around.</string>
  <string id="6160841">Who says I don't mean her too?</string>
  <string id="6160844">Who says I don't mean him too?</string>
  <string id="6160847">This city's full of people who are dead set on ending badly. I don't want to see you end up the same way.</string>
  <string id="6160850">Would asking you to stop spying on me help in the least?</string>
  <string id="6160853">No.</string>
  <string id="6160857">So, Carver, have you thought about what you'll do if your expedition doesn't pay off?</string>
  <string id="6160860">This is our only chance and you know it.</string>
  <string id="6160863">You're so damned proud you couldn't pick up a trade?</string>
  <string id="6160866">And who would take a Fereldan apprentice? Maybe in another year I could work my way up to piss-boy.</string>
  <string id="6160869">Fine, let's crawl down some holes. Good bloody luck for your sake.</string>
  <string id="6160872">What should I be doing?</string>
  <string id="6160875">You just have to look pretty, dear.</string>
  <string id="6160881">I remember you! The kind one!</string>
  <string id="6160884">Well, well, if it isn't our favorite little guardsman.</string>
  <string id="6160887">Here to make sure we aren't stealing from the viscount again?</string>
  <string id="6160890">That was a mistake. I've already apologized enough.</string>
  <string id="6160897">Please keep it quiet, serah. The viscount mustn't be disturbed.</string>
  <string id="6160898">Good day to you, serah.</string>
  <string id="6160918">A quiet day, today, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6160943">Are you safe, Fenris?</string>
  <string id="6160946">No.</string>
  <string id="6160949">You know, some guards give people the opportunity to lie if it will keep the peace.</string>
  <string id="6160952">You can see what I am. Lie to yourself if you must.</string>
  <string id="6160956">You are known, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6160959">What?</string>
  <string id="6160962">I'm going through Jeven's neglected reports. Some involve you. And requests about you.</string>
  <string id="6160965">By whom?</string>
  <string id="6160968">I don't know. They're old, poorly kept. But you should be on your best behavior.</string>
  <string id="6160971">Thank you for getting rid of them.</string>
  <string id="6160974">I didn't.</string>
  <string id="6160978">All right, I'm just going to say it. Fenris, you need to present yourself better.</string>
  <string id="6160981">What are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="6160984">You're squatting in Hightown. I sympathize with your claims, but your neighbors have influence.</string>
  <string id="6160987">My claims?</string>
  <string id="6160990">To the estate. Rightfully stolen isn't exactly something I can forward to the viscount. Be more discreet about... yourself.</string>
  <string id="6160993">I shall endeavor to exist with less offense.</string>
  <string id="6160997">Fenris, did you consider my offer for you to train the guard in Tevinter fighting techniques? I've heard nothing.</string>
  <string id="6161000">My abilities were inflicted, not taught. I will not pass that on.</string>
  <string id="6161003">Some good should come of them.</string>
  <string id="6161006">No.</string>
  <string id="6161010">Do you feel like a citizen, Fenris?</string>
  <string id="6161013">Excuse me?</string>
  <string id="6161016">You've been in Kirkwall as long as I have. Does it feel like home?</string>
  <string id="6161019">It feels. That itself has been a surprise.</string>
  <string id="6161022">I think I know what you mean.</string>
  <string id="6161023">I think I had a chance for that and missed it.</string>
  <string id="6161024">I have no comparison, really. It feels like a free place.</string>
  <string id="6161027">Maybe that’s enough.</string>
  <string id="6161030">We shall see.</string>
  <string id="6161034">There's a war coming. Does it feel different, fighting by choice?</string>
  <string id="6161037">You were never ordered to kill?</string>
  <string id="6161040">I was a soldier, but I was willing.</string>
  <string id="6161043">I was willing, as well, but not by choice. Laughs If that makes any sense.</string>
  <string id="6161046">Does anything in this mess?</string>
  <string id="6161052">So, Isabela. You're a captain?</string>
  <string id="6161055">That's right, big girl. What of it?</string>
  <string id="6161058">I don't remember your name on any registries. Every ship that docks has to declare.</string>
  <string id="6161061">I never docked, and you're no port authority.</string>
  <string id="6161064">And you... are no merchant.</string>
  <string id="6161067">Ooh... scrutiny.</string>
  <string id="6161071">Well. Captain. Can I call you captain? You can call me captain.</string>
  <string id="6161074">I won't be doing that.</string>
  <string id="6161077">Neither will I. Because you're a guard captain. No real authority. Not like on a ship.</string>
  <string id="6161080">Well, you would know about having a large number of men under you.</string>
  <string id="6161083">You've been waiting to use that one. Did you practice?</string>
  <string id="6161086">Shut up.</string>
  <string id="6161090">I had trouble with another of your women, Isabela. She stole from a... distracted client. You're lucky she wasn't jailed.</string>
  <string id="6161093">My women? I am but a shepherd. And what free enterprise are you oppressing now?</string>
  <string id="6161096">Theft is not enterprise.</string>
  <string id="6161099">Opportunities insufficiently guarded. Victimless crimes.</string>
  <string id="6161102">Except for all the victims.</string>
  <string id="6161105">Details. Victimless details.</string>
  <string id="6161109">So, how good is Donnic? Is he cocksure?</string>
  <string id="6161112">Sighs Just... get it out of your system.</string>
  <string id="6161115">Did he curl your toes?</string>
  <string id="6161118">Pudding your peach?</string>
  <string id="6161121">Dwarf your beard? </string>
  <string id="6161124">Grope your grinder?</string>
  <string id="6161127">Dampen your Divine?</string>
  <string id="6161130">Float your frigate?</string>
  <string id="6161133">Arl your Eamon?</string>
  <string id="6161136">Pamper your Paragon?</string>
  <string id="6161139">Kaddis your Katie?</string>
  <string id="6161142">Shank your Jory?</string>
  <string id="6161145">Gray your Warden?</string>
  <string id="6161148">Establish his canon?</string>
  <string id="6161151">Praise your Maker?</string>
  <string id="6161154">Or master your taint? That's an old one.</string>
  <string id="6161157">How about satisfy a demand of your Qun.</string>
  <string id="6161160">Or did he Cup your Joining?</string>
  <string id="6161163">Yes, all right? He is an incredibly proficient lover. Happy?</string>
  <string id="6161166">Well that's rather personal, don't you think?</string>
  <string id="6161186">You know, Isabela. If someone had told me that I'd put up with you for all these years, I'd have punched them flat.</string>
  <string id="6161189">And if someone had told me you'd leave first, I'd have called them daft.</string>
  <string id="6161192">Don't celebrate yet. It'll take time.</string>
  <string id="6161195">Do I look like I'm smiling, big girl?</string>
  <string id="6161198">Don't bullshit me with “respected rival” garbage now. You're not sorry to see me go.</string>
  <string id="6161201">No. But I'm sorry you gave up.</string>
  <string id="6161202">And if someone had told me I'd still be here, I'd have done the same.</string>
  <string id="6161205">You have your ship. What’s stopping you?</string>
  <string id="6161208">Save your bits, you'll have your ship one day.</string>
  <string id="6161211">And what would you do without me as a constant headache in the Rose?</string>
  <string id="6161214">Someone would rush to fill the hole. You know, like you never left.</string>
  <string id="6161217">That’s my girl.</string>
  <string id="6161218">I don't know what I'm supposed to do...</string>
  <string id="6161221">Sweetie, it's an easy job. You can do it asleep. They never notice. And some of them enjoy it more that way. Creeps.</string>
  <string id="6161231">Varric, do you do anything?</string>
  <string id="6161234">Am I the next stop in your career evaluations? Joy of joys.</string>
  <string id="6161237">You watch and you talk. Is that it?</string>
  <string id="6161240">You are dismissing hallmarks of both the utterly ineffectual and the incredibly dangerous.</string>
  <string id="6161243">I don't know what you mean.</string>
  <string id="6161246">It means coins flow when I talk and when I shut up. Like if you got paid to guard or unguard.</string>
  <string id="6161249">That makes no sense.</string>
  <string id="6161252">Good.</string>
  <string id="6161256">Maybe I should put you to use, Varric. Have you pen some warnings for the lawless.</string>
  <string id="6161259">Who’s that for? Are most criminals big readers? Seems like pacifying the nobles.</string>
  <string id="6161262">Pictures then. It was just a suggestion.</string>
  <string id="6161265">How about a giant sign that just says Don't. You could hit people with it.</string>
  <string id="6161268">Thank you, I get the point.</string>
  <string id="6161272">You, Varric, have a very large mouth.</string>
  <string id="6161275">And here I've always looked up to you. What is it now?</string>
  <string id="6161278">There were fistfights in the barracks over who is the model for your guard serial.</string>
  <string id="6161281">Hard in Hightown. Riveting stuff. Everyone loves a dirty guard on the edge.</string>
  <string id="6161284">Varric.</string>
  <string id="6161287">Fine. I'll start his big finish. Three chapters until Donnen Brennicovick retires and opens a tavern on the coast.</string>
  <string id="6161291">You are very close to losing your printing blocks, Varric.</string>
  <string id="6161294">Once more I am falsely accused of whatever it is that I am accused of. Falsely.</string>
  <string id="6161297">Someone swapped the text of my recruitment poster with some filth from the Blooming Rose.</string>
  <string id="6161300">That does sound pretty good.</string>
  <string id="6161303">Sure, fill the barracks with whores. But you've also filled the Rose with guards.</string>
  <string id="6161306">It’s true what they say. The best comedy comes from tragedy.</string>
  <string id="6161310">You're too quiet, Varric.</string>
  <string id="6161313">I'm thinking of switching to romances. Nothing? Not even a foreboding frown?</string>
  <string id="6161316">I am content. Write what you will.</string>
  <string id="6161319">Well that certainly takes the fun out of it. Contentment in the barracks? Who'll pay to hear that shit?</string>
  <string id="6161322">Then I should have thought of it years ago.</string>
  <string id="6161323">Do what you will. I don't care.</string>
  <string id="6161326">That is... not a comforting thought.</string>
  <string id="6161329">It is what it is. I'm used to it.</string>
  <string id="6161332">I think we've both lost some inspiration.</string>
  <string id="6161336">How are you at finales, Varric?</string>
  <string id="6161339">I'm expecting some practical experience fairly soon.</string>
  <string id="6161342">Make it a good one, will you?</string>
  <string id="6161345">For you, madam, endless sunsets and roses.</string>
  <string id="6161348">Varric.</string>
  <string id="6161351">And the swift hand of the law sweeping all aside. I thought it went unsaid.</string>
  <string id="6161356">Can't get enough? Well, who can, really?</string>
  <string id="6161359">This encounter will have a high challenge rating, big boy.</string>
  <string id="6161362">Well, aren't you adventurous? Let's get you some experience, sweetie...</string>
  <string id="6161369">I don't care how much that man pays, I am not rubbing Hubert's feet again until he bathes! Disgusting.</string>
  <string id="6161372">Templars for you all day, is it?</string>
  <string id="6161375">Scoffs Elves!</string>
  <string id="6161378">They love dwarves. I don't ask why. Probably don't want to know. At least they tip well.</string>
  <string id="6161404">The way this place attracts templars, you'd think it was full of apostates.</string>
  <string id="6161407">It should be searched. Thoroughly.</string>
  <string id="6161411">It's not entirely your fault, darling.</string>
  <string id="6161414">I should never have let him learn to cut purses...</string>
  <string id="6161422">Did you take the perfume out of my room?</string>
  <string id="6161425">What would I want with perfume? Do I look like a woman?</string>
  <string id="6161428">Of course you do, sweetie—you're an elf. And not a pretty one, I'm afraid, but there it is.</string>
  <string id="6161431">I haven't seen the seneschal much lately. Don't tell me the man's gone religious.</string>
  <string id="6161434">No, he just keeps terrible hours now.</string>
  <string id="6161436">Let's hope it stays that way.</string>
  <string id="6161439">Cora and Katriela are being horrible to my boy! Can't you stop them?</string>
  <string id="6161442">Quintus! Can't I have just one drink?</string>
  <string id="6161445">Madam says no, and I'm not crossing that old bat for anything.</string>
  <string id="6161448">Fetch mummy a glass of wine, won't you darling?</string>
  <string id="6161449">You'd better tip this time.</string>
  <string id="6161456">If they want to waste their time disciplining your useless brat, let them.</string>
  <string id="6161460">I do hope the viscount remembers to eat supper today.</string>
  <string id="6161461">That corner looks dusty. How embarrassing.</string>
  <string id="6161464">Don't you threaten my boy, you skinny hag! I'll have you sacked!</string>
  <string id="6161467">Madam doesn't give a rat's ass about your brat. She pays me a copper every time I kick the little bastard.</string>
  <string id="6161479">No servants to blame for theft today, good Garol?</string>
  <string id="6161482">Day's still young. Servant.</string>
  <string id="6161485">Why do you get paid more than me?</string>
  <string id="6161499">The guard wouldn't have taken my boy if you'd just been decent to him!</string>
  <string id="6161502">Because I'm better than you. At everything.</string>
  <string id="6161505">You mean if I hadn't yelled, Stop! Thief when he stole my wages? Fat chance, sweetie.</string>
  <string id="6161506">I heard you were invited to the Keep last night.</string>
  <string id="6161510">Hightown is such a strange place. It feels like it's miles away from everywhere else.</string>
  <string id="6161517">Good luck getting in. I've been waiting all day.</string>
  <string id="6161518">How much longer do I have to wait?</string>
  <string id="6161522">You there. Some wine. I'll not wait around all day without proper refreshments.</string>
  <string id="6161525">Yes, messere. I'll have some sent right up.</string>
  <string id="6161528">Oh, and bring me some cheese, too. I'm starving.</string>
  <string id="6161531">You do realize it's rude to keep people waiting for so long.</string>
  <string id="6161534">The viscount means no disrespect, he's a very busy man.</string>
  <string id="6161537">Oh, shut it. I don't need a servant to explain the duties of nobility to me.</string>
  <string id="6161541">Messere. Please stop kicking the wall.</string>
  <string id="6161544">Who are you to talk to me like that, you bloody peasant?</string>
  <string id="6161547">The guard who'll throw you out if you kick that wall one more time.</string>
  <string id="6161570">What are you doing out of the alienage?</string>
  <string id="6161573">Simply running an errand, messere!</string>
  <string id="6161574">That's my next stop, I promise!</string>
  <string id="6161575">Right away, messere.</string>
  <string id="6161583">Scat!</string>
  <string id="6161586">I see you picking pockets, you're done!</string>
  <string id="6161589">Gasps</string>
  <string id="6161590">I'm not afraid of you!</string>
  <string id="6161591">I haven't done nothing!</string>
  <string id="6161598">Little early for you to be out, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6161601">Don't you worry about me, messere.</string>
  <string id="6161602">Oh, I can handle myself!</string>
  <string id="6161603">Looking for a discount, hmm?</string>
  <string id="6161604">No luck today?</string>
  <string id="6161607">Day's early!</string>
  <string id="6161608">I'm resting. Don't you mind me.</string>
  <string id="6161609">Laughs Not yet!</string>
  <string id="6161610">You be careful, serah.</string>
  <string id="6161613">Of you, maybe.</string>
  <string id="6161614">Don't you make me bring you in again.</string>
  <string id="6161618">Shove off, you.</string>
  <string id="6161619">Maybe later, darling.</string>
  <string id="6161629">Go back to the alienage. Now!</string>
  <string id="6161632">I'm simply running an errand, messere!</string>
  <string id="6161633">That's my next stop, I promise!</string>
  <string id="6161634">Right away, messere.</string>
  <string id="6161644">The alienage, Sundermount, Ferelden... those could be from a dream.</string>
  <string id="6161647">Oh, ma vhenan, I didn't see you there. I'm going to visit the alienage. Do you want anything from Lowtown?</string>
  <string id="6161648">There's nothing in that cesspit I want.</string>
  <string id="6161649">No, I don't.</string>
  <string id="6161650">Are you close to many of the people in the alienage?</string>
  <string id="6161651">Visiting friends there?</string>
  <string id="6161652">I almost miss Lowtown. I haven't had my pocket picked in ages.</string>
  <string id="6161653">Say hi to the beggars for me.</string>
  <string id="6162018">It's not so bad. Better than Darktown! Or the Gallows!</string>
  <string id="6162019">No, not really. I think most of them don't even know my name.</string>
  <string id="6162020">It's such a friendly gesture, sticking your hand in someone else's pocket. The Dalish are never that familiar.</string>
  <string id="6162034">I'm... stopping by my house for a bit, that's all.</string>
  <string id="6162037">I've left some things undone there. I'll be back later.</string>
  <string id="6162044">The viscount must be terribly busy. I've been waiting most of the day.</string>
  <string id="6162045">I wonder if I should try coming back tomorrow?</string>
  <string id="6162049">I don't mean to bother you, but would I be able to get some water?</string>
  <string id="6162052">Of course, my lady. Are you hungry as well? I can have a plate brought up.</string>
  <string id="6162055">Oh, that would be lovely.</string>
  <string id="6162068">My lady, you've been so patient. Is there something I can get for you?</string>
  <string id="6162071">Oh, no. I'm quite all right. It's my own fault for not bringing something to do.</string>
  <string id="6162074">Just let me know if you need anything.</string>
  <string id="6162080">You go to the alienage almost every day.</string>
  <string id="6162081">You spend too much time there.</string>
  <string id="6162082">Whatever you're doing, watch yourself, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6162083">Be careful.</string>
  <string id="6162084">If you'd just move in all your stuff, you wouldn't have to keep going there.</string>
  <string id="6162085">Just bring your stuff here.</string>
  <string id="6162088">So, Donnic was in the Rose.</string>
  <string id="6162091">He was not!</string>
  <string id="6162094">Easy, big girl. He wasn't shopping for himself. You're lucky to have a man who wants to please you.</string>
  <string id="6162097">But, maybe you could indulge him more. Are there areas of intimacy you haven't explored?</string>
  <string id="6162100">Why? Why do you give me these doubts!</string>
  <string id="6162103">Aveline. If you shove your thumb up his ass, I win.</string>
  <string id="6162104">Good. Happy for him. He needs to calm down.</string>
  <string id="6162107">You're tough on the man. I don't see how it's his fault if you missed your chance.</string>
  <string id="6162110">Isabela, I realize that you are always prepared for a sudden random phallus, but for your own safety, shut your mouth!</string>
  <string id="6162113">Don't just leave me waiting. What is it?</string>
  <string id="6162116">There's a killer in Kirkwall who sends his victims white lilies before he takes them. He's murdered several women already.</string>
  <string id="6162123">There's nothing wrong with that. I am an elf, in case you've forgotten.</string>
  <string id="6162126">I... will. Thank you, ma vhenan.</string>
  <string id="6162129">It's better if... some things stay far away from this house.</string>
  <string id="6162132">Back before dark, I promise.</string>
  <string id="6162138">All right. The boy and I will stay here in case she returns. </string>
  <string id="6162230">Note</string>
  <string id="6162232">I know someone who might be able to help: Gascard DuPuis.</string>
  <string id="6162237">Note</string>
  <string id="6162242">Note</string>
  <string id="6162245">We're going to win.</string>
  <string id="6162248">Don't be nervous. Things are going so well!</string>
  <string id="6162251">I guess I shouldn't be surprised that nothing turned out the way I'd hoped.</string>
  <string id="6162254">Especially not... with you.</string>
  <string id="6162262">Maybe I was. It's none of your business where my business goes.</string>
  <string id="6162266">Mother!</string>
  <string id="6162269">There's nothing to be done. The magic that kept her alive...</string>
  <string id="6162272">There's nothing I can do. His magic was keeping her alive.</string>
  <string id="6162275">His magic was the only thing keeping her alive. I'm so sorry.</string>
  <string id="6162278">I knew you would come.</string>
  <string id="6162279">I tried to find you.</string>
  <string id="6162280">I wasn't fast enough.</string>
  <string id="6162281">Don't move, Mother. We'll find a way to...</string>
  <string id="6162282">I'm going to save you.</string>
  <string id="6162283">You know me. I always save the day.</string>
  <string id="6162284">Don't I always?</string>
  <string id="6162288">Shh. Don't fret, darling.</string>
  <string id="6162291">That man would have kept me trapped in here. But now... I'm free.</string>
  <string id="6162294">I'll be with Carver and Bethany... and your father. But you'll be all alone.</string>
  <string id="6162295">I get to see Bethany again... and your father. But you'll be here alone.</string>
  <string id="6162296">I get to see Carver again... and your father. But you'll be here alone.</string>
  <string id="6162297">I should have watched over you more closely, I should have...</string>
  <string id="6162298">I failed you.</string>
  <string id="6162300">Goodbye, Mother.</string>
  <string id="6162301">I'll remember you as you were.</string>
  <string id="6162304">I'll miss you.</string>
  <string id="6162307">Say hello to them for me.</string>
  <string id="6162310">I'll be fine, Mother.</string>
  <string id="6162311">Don't worry about me.</string>
  <string id="6162312">My little girl has become so strong.</string>
  <string id="6162315">I love you. You've always made me so proud.</string>
  <string id="6162324">Can't you take that Amell fellow? Just once?</string>
  <string id="6162327">He likes you better. Asks for you by name. And isn't the customer always right?</string>
  <string id="6162333">What's your secret?</string>
  <string id="6162336">Pardon?</string>
  <string id="6162339">You're paid more than anyone else in the Rose. Even Quintus! How'd you do it?</string>
  <string id="6162342">Dwarves are irresistible. I can't help it.</string>
  <string id="6162346">Wait, wait... you say you saw Leandra?</string>
  <string id="6162349">I did. What of it?</string>
  <string id="6162352">Blue dress? Grey hair? Her cloak was brown, I think. She holds it closed with a round brooch, silver with... with garnets.</string>
  <string id="6162357">Let's go sheath that weapon of yours.</string>
  <string id="6162360">Do you want to take another look at my ditties?</string>
  <string id="6162363">Wanting to get in touch with nature, I see.</string>
  <string id="6162365">My little boy has become so strong.</string>
  <string id="6162372">A Slave's Life</string>
  <string id="6162376">Did you bathe this time, Master Amell? I've had... complaints.</string>
  <string id="6162379">Of course I have! A few days ago.</string>
  <string id="6162381">The Champion? Here?</string>
  <string id="6162384">It's the captain? Are we ready for this?</string>
  <string id="6162389">Go on up, ser. They're waiting.</string>
  <string id="6162404">Fine day, serah.</string>
  <string id="6162405">Hope the day is treating you well, serah.</string>
  <string id="6162409">You speak to me as if I'm touched in the head.</string>
  <string id="6162412">You mean you aren't?</string>
  <string id="6162415">What's your excuse, then?</string>
  <string id="6162419">A fine day, isn't it, Chel?</string>
  <string id="6162422">Indeed, it is, Garol.</string>
  <string id="6162425">Ugh. Find yourselves a broom closet for the next five minutes and leave me in peace.</string>
  <string id="6162430">Blade of Mercy</string>
  <string id="6162436">He didn't really ask you to wear a feather boa!</string>
  <string id="6162439">What's the matter, my love?</string>
  <string id="6162444">Orlesians, darling. You get used to it.</string>
  <string id="6162446">Look at this mess. Quentin's clearly insane. </string>
  <string id="6162447">Don't you see what he's done?</string>
  <string id="6162448">Insane... but powerful.</string>
  <string id="6162455">Tell me the truth: Am I losing my chest hair?</string>
  <string id="6162458">You'll still be pretty, even if you do.</string>
  <string id="6162461">I was thinking of changing my hairstyle.</string>
  <string id="6162464">That's brilliant! You have had this one for seven years now.</string>
  <string id="6162485">Back for more?</string>
  <string id="6162489">Got quite the spear, haven't you?</string>
  <string id="6162493">One of us won't be able to walk away from this.</string>
  <string id="6162499">I keep telling Lusine, once they go dwarf, they never go back.</string>
  <string id="6162503">Looking to explore the Deep Roads, are you?</string>
  <string id="6162507">You made the only reasonable choice.</string>
  <string id="6162510">That did not just happen.</string>
  <string id="6162511">That... was definitely not what I was expecting.</string>
  <string id="6162512">Note to self: be more specific when asking for something different.</string>
  <string id="6162518">I swear, I'm not making this up. He actually said, Exalted March of the Dales.</string>
  <string id="6162522">Greetings, serah.</string>
  <string id="6162525">So good to see you again.</string>
  <string id="6162528">You seem to be in good spirits.</string>
  <string id="6162531">May I say you're looking lovely today?</string>
  <string id="6162534">Everything well with your family, I hope?</string>
  <string id="6162537">A new family arrived from the Starkhaven alienage. Have you heard?</string>
  <string id="6162540">Isn't it exciting? I hope they have a young daughter my son can meet.</string>
  <string id="6162541">I found a job down at the docks today, sweeping the warehouses.</string>
  <string id="6162544">Oh, you're quite lucky!</string>
  <string id="6162548">Oh, hello!</string>
  <string id="6162551">Everything is well with you?</string>
  <string id="6162554">Greetings.</string>
  <string id="6162557">You're looking good.</string>
  <string id="6162560">Thank you! We should get our families together soon.</string>
  <string id="6162561">I trust your family is in good health?</string>
  <string id="6162564">So far, thank the Maker.</string>
  <string id="6162565">There's to be a marriage next week, have you heard?</string>
  <string id="6162568">I have! We're going to decorate the vhenadahl tomorrow evening.</string>
  <string id="6162569">Is your husband still looking for work?</string>
  <string id="6162572">I'm afraid so. Andraste willing, he'll find something soon.</string>
  <string id="6162584">Blessed be all the Maker's children, even those who struggle against His wisdom.</string>
  <string id="6162585">Greetings, child. I hope to see you at the chantry soon?</string>
  <string id="6162588">I will bring my whole family if I can, messere.</string>
  <string id="6162594">We all know the guard hurt that poor girl, but will anyone do anything?</string>
  <string id="6162598">I can't believe a Keeper came to the city! I've never heard of such a thing!</string>
  <string id="6162602">Such a terrible tragedy. So many elves, gone.</string>
  <string id="6162603">Huon killed so many people, and yet nobody seems to care.</string>
  <string id="6162604">Sighs Another day...</string>
  <string id="6162605">Maker bless us with His wisdom.</string>
  <string id="6162606">Our children will do better than us. One day.</string>
  <string id="6162607">I wonder what Hightown's like.</string>
  <string id="6162614">I need four more dwarven ales.</string>
  <string id="6162633">Right, drinks. Coming. Sit.</string>
  <string id="6162640">Are you messing up my orders on purpose? I said Nevarran red, not Orlesian!</string>
  <string id="6162643">What's wrong with the new girl?</string>
  <string id="6162646">First-day jitters. She'll be fine.</string>
  <string id="6162649">Pumpkin, it's all going to the same place in the end. Tell the customer to be a little more worldly.</string>
  <string id="6162653">What can I get for you?</string>
  <string id="6162654">Another one?</string>
  <string id="6162655">I'll put that on your tab.</string>
  <string id="6162658">Back for more?</string>
  <string id="6162661">Why don't we go upstairs and see how exalted this march will be?</string>
  <string id="6162664">Oh, if it were up to me, I'd have done this for free. </string>
  <string id="6162667">You think that's bad? Mine wanted me to dress up like the viscount.</string>
  <string id="6162670">Oh, that's just sick. Politics should stay out of the bedroom.</string>
  <string id="6162676">Do you think Lusine will hire one of those oxmen?</string>
  <string id="6162682">Lusine would hire the Maker, if He returned.</string>
  <string id="6162685">She'd try. But she's so cheap, she'd never afford him.</string>
  <string id="6162688">The city's going mad. I might head for Orlais before things get worse.</string>
  <string id="6162691">I'd love to go to Orlais, but I'll never afford it.</string>
  <string id="6162694">Forget Orlais. At least go to to Cumberland. Anything is better than this place.</string>
  <string id="6162701">You can wear the collar this time.</string>
  <string id="6162704">Are you a warrior? You're carrying quite the sword.</string>
  <string id="6162707">I'll join your party.</string>
  <string id="6162711">Why hello there!</string>
  <string id="6162714">Busy today, I see?</string>
  <string id="6162717">Good to see you again.</string>
  <string id="6162720">The boys and I are going for drinks later, if you'd like to join us.</string>
  <string id="6162723">Don't mind if I do! See you there.</string>
  <string id="6162724">Your wife is over her sickness, I hope?</string>
  <string id="6162727">The worst is over. I pray she'll get better soon; I've missed too much work already.</string>
  <string id="6162728">I don't suppose you've heard of any work?</string>
  <string id="6162731">Not yet. The shem who oversees the docks says he doesn't want any more knife ears than necessary.</string>
  <string id="6162734">Bloody shems. We work as well as anyone else.</string>
  <string id="6162735">Will I see you at the tavern later?</string>
  <string id="6162738">Not today. My sisters have me decorating the vhenadahl.</string>
  <string id="6162741">Roped you in, did they? Well, good luck!</string>
  <string id="6162745">Oh, hello!</string>
  <string id="6162748">Good to see you again, my dear.</string>
  <string id="6162751">Greetings.</string>
  <string id="6162754">You kept my brother out far too late last night.</string>
  <string id="6162757">Laughs He's an adult now, isn't he? But I promise I'll be more careful.</string>
  <string id="6162758">My cousin said he might have a job for you. Thought you should know.</string>
  <string id="6162761">Did he? I'll have to speak with him soon. Thank you!</string>
  <string id="6162762">The priest was asking after you again last week.</string>
  <string id="6162765">I've brought my family there twice this year. What more does she want from us?</string>
  <string id="6162766">How is your wife doing? Still recovering?</string>
  <string id="6162769">The weakness comes and goes, but I'm hoping for the best. Thank you for asking.</string>
  <string id="6162773">You knife ears should go back to the alienage, that's what.</string>
  <string id="6162776">Drunken shem.</string>
  <string id="6162777">Bloody elves.</string>
  <string id="6162781">Maker watch over you, serah.</string>
  <string id="6162782">Greetings, serah. I have not seen you at the chantry in some time.</string>
  <string id="6162785">I must find work, messere, and my wife has been very ill.</string>
  <string id="6162788">The Maker will not wait for you. You must find the time for Him.</string>
  <string id="6162791">Yes, messere. Of course.</string>
  <string id="6162798">Nobody is doing anything to avenge that girl. Well, something will be done! We'll see to it!</string>
  <string id="6162802">A Keeper in the alienage? Unbelievable!</string>
  <string id="6162806">They should've killed Huon. Then he'd never have gotten out at all.</string>
  <string id="6162807">Bloody humans. They can keep their Maker, that's what.</string>
  <string id="6162808">I swear, I should bring my family out to those Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6162809">Sighs Who am I kidding?</string>
  <string id="6162810">Hopefully I can find work soon. There has to be something!</string>
  <string id="6162948">Those are some fine amulets you have.</string>
  <string id="6162951">They aren't all simply amulets, messere. Some are magical!</string>
  <string id="6162952">These rings are so expensive!</string>
  <string id="6162955">A bargain at any price! And some are enchanted.</string>
  <string id="6162959">Quite a collection of amulets.</string>
  <string id="6162962">Indeed it is, messere! Try one on!</string>
  <string id="6162963">What sorts of rings are those?</string>
  <string id="6162966">Some come from the master jewelsmiths of Minrathous. I can show you if you like!</string>
  <string id="6162973">Champion! Surely you have need of something.</string>
  <string id="6162977">My good man! Might you have need of a new belt?</string>
  <string id="6162978">A ring for your lovely wife, yes?</string>
  <string id="6162982">My good woman! Perhaps you'd like a new amulet to wear?</string>
  <string id="6162986">Come! See my collection for yourself!</string>
  <string id="6162987">These prices cannot be beat! I swear it in Andraste's name!</string>
  <string id="6162988">Come, messere! Don't be shy!</string>
  <string id="6162989">By all means, see if there's something that takes your fancy!</string>
  <string id="6162990">I am always willing to haggle.</string>
  <string id="6163114">I would like to know more about being a guard, Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6163117">I don't think that's the job for you.</string>
  <string id="6163120">I know, but it might help me not get caught.</string>
  <string id="6163123">You probably shouldn't have said that part.</string>
  <string id="6163126">Why?</string>
  <string id="6163129">Just... never mind.</string>
  <string id="6163133">Why don't you arrest us, Aveline?</string>
  <string id="6163136">What?</string>
  <string id="6163139">We break the law. I'm pretty sure. There are laws for almost everything. You're not a bad guard, are you?</string>
  <string id="6163142">No!</string>
  <string id="6163145">That's good. Is it because you're fond of Hawke? I kind of am.</string>
  <string id="6163148">How very nice for you. Keep it to yourself.</string>
  <string id="6163151">I'd rather keep it with her.</string>
  <string id="6163152">I'd rather keep it with him.</string>
  <string id="6163153">That's good. You look uncomfortable. Did I say something wrong again?</string>
  <string id="6163156">No, Merrill, that's fine.</string>
  <string id="6163159">Ah. Maybe it's your shoes.</string>
  <string id="6163163">You're incredibly talented, Merrill. I can see you are meant for great things.</string>
  <string id="6163166">Thank you!</string>
  <string id="6163169">But you're stupid.</string>
  <string id="6163172">I'm sorry, what?</string>
  <string id="6163175">Don't you think it would be better to work on where you are now, instead of recreating old glory?</string>
  <string id="6163178">No. No, that's kind of the opposite of what I've been saying. I'm the stupid one? Whatever.</string>
  <string id="6163182">Giggles</string>
  <string id="6163185">Yes?</string>
  <string id="6163188">Is it like you thought? It's nice, isn't it? He seems nice.</string>
  <string id="6163191">Yes, he's very nice.</string>
  <string id="6163194">I know! And you're so cute when you're with him! Not like normal-you at all!</string>
  <string id="6163197">Haven't you got something unholy to do?</string>
  <string id="6163200">No, we're following Hawke. That's important, too.</string>
  <string id="6163204">Aveline, what's in your mirror?</string>
  <string id="6163207">What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="6163210">In your mirror. What do you see?</string>
  <string id="6163213">A warrior. A wife. All the mistakes I made to get here and make it right.</string>
  <string id="6163216">A Guardian. All the people I protect. Doubt, sometimes.</string>
  <string id="6163219">Why? What have you decided to see?</string>
  <string id="6163222">My mirror is broken. But I think... I think I see good things.</string>
  <string id="6163225">Maybe a headband.</string>
  <string id="6163226">Demons. And... cracks.</string>
  <string id="6163229">Sometimes it's hard to tell. Cracks, mostly.</string>
  <string id="6163232">Maybe I'll borrow yours sometime. If that's all right?</string>
  <string id="6163235">It's all right.</string>
  <string id="6163239">I didn't expect you to stick around for this mess, Merrill. This has nothing to do with your elves.</string>
  <string id="6163242">I love Hawke. I wouldn't go anywhere.</string>
  <string id="6163245">But it's not your fight.</string>
  <string id="6163248">I love Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6163251">You said that.</string>
  <string id="6163254">I say it a lot. It makes things clearer. Takes away doubt when everything is crazy and people are dying.</string>
  <string id="6163257">I understand.</string>
  <string id="6163260">Oh good. Someone should.</string>
  <string id="6163261">What about you? You're quitting!</string>
  <string id="6163264">That's complicated.</string>
  <string id="6163267">Not if I understand it. You're walking away, like... like everyone does.</string>
  <string id="6163270">Sometimes, it's the best choice.</string>
  <string id="6163273">It's the easiest. You're supposed to do the hard stuff. That's why... I liked you.</string>
  <string id="6163274">It shouldn't be. Not when people need you. I don't want to give up like that.</string>
  <string id="6163277">Sometimes they give up on you.</string>
  <string id="6163280">Friends don't do that. I wouldn't.</string>
  <string id="6163281">Everything affects everything. We were born, a bunch of things happened, and now we're in a mess with our friends.</string>
  <string id="6163284">That seems too simple.</string>
  <string id="6163287">Simple is good. It sneaks up on you, makes you smile.</string>
  <string id="6163290"> Or maybe it says, Hey, over there! And kills with a pin.</string>
  <string id="6163293">Merrill?</string>
  <string id="6163296">Simple, Aveline. Not stupid.</string>
  <string id="6163297">Maybe that should be enough once in a while.</string>
  <string id="6163300">Simple it is.</string>
  <string id="6163324">Do you even know her name, shem? No? It's Danyla. She's dead.</string>
  <string id="6163327">And you killed her!</string>
  <string id="6163330">I was a beast then. A werewolf. I did... many terrible things. I-I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6163334">It didn't have to come to this.</string>
  <string id="6163337">Take this. And thanks.</string>
  <string id="6163338">She was crazy. Just insane.</string>
  <string id="6163341">Thank you. She would've killed me!</string>
  <string id="6163346">Sorry does not bring my mother back!</string>
  <string id="6163349">I was a victim, too, elf. Of Zathrian's vengeance. Stranger, please calm her down.</string>
  <string id="6163350">Did I hear you right? You're a werewolf?</string>
  <string id="6163351">A werewolf?</string>
  <string id="6163352">I was one, but no longer. Her Dalish Keeper cursed some humans with lycanthropy long ago.</string>
  <string id="6163355">The disease spread over the years. But the Hero of Ferelden freed us.</string>
  <string id="6163356">I'm not a werewolf. How many times do I have to say it? Y-you're crazy.</string>
  <string id="6163359">Lies!</string>
  <string id="6163362">Help! This crazy elf is going to kill me!</string>
  <string id="6163363">He doesn't look like a werewolf, Dalish. He seems harmless.</string>
  <string id="6163364">You think he's a werewolf?</string>
  <string id="6163365">He hides in human form. Do not let him fool you.</string>
  <string id="6163368">P-please. She's scaring me.</string>
  <string id="6163370">Let him go.</string>
  <string id="6163371">He was cursed. You can't blame him for that.</string>
  <string id="6163374">You have the wrong man.</string>
  <string id="6163377">You stand up for him?</string>
  <string id="6163380">Fine. Then you will die for him!</string>
  <string id="6163384">Do what you will.</string>
  <string id="6163385">He's all yours.</string>
  <string id="6163388">You better be right, or you're killing an innocent.</string>
  <string id="6163391">Run, shem. It will make the hunt more enjoyable.</string>
  <string id="6163394">Is this what your mother would want?</string>
  <string id="6163395">Don't do this.</string>
  <string id="6163396">You shame me. My mother... would not want this.</string>
  <string id="6163399">Leave, shem. Before I change my mind.</string>
  <string id="6163405">You ever going to stop harping on the mages here?</string>
  <string id="6163408">No.</string>
  <string id="6163411">They aren't what you saw in Tevinter.</string>
  <string id="6163414">The moment they are free, mages will make themselves magisters.</string>
  <string id="6163417">They're slaves! You should want to help them!</string>
  <string id="6163420">I don't.</string>
  <string id="6163421">So, there must be mages in Tevinter who don't use blood magic.</string>
  <string id="6163424">Of course. There are slaves. The magisters do not hesitate to collar their own kind.</string>
  <string id="6163427">But no magisters?</string>
  <string id="6163430">Why must you go on about this? No magister would turn down an advantage over his rivals. If he did, he'd be dead.</string>
  <string id="6163433">You know, to use blood magic, you need to look a demon in the eye and accept his offer.</string>
  <string id="6163436">I just figured some of them would say no. For esthetic reasons, if nothing else.</string>
  <string id="6163437">Is there something you want, Anders?</string>
  <string id="6163440">You really don't have the temperament for a slave.</string>
  <string id="6163443">Is that a compliment or an insult?</string>
  <string id="6163446">I'm just wondering how your master didn't kill you.</string>
  <string id="6163449">How have the templars not killed you?</string>
  <string id="6163452">I'm charming.</string>
  <string id="6163453">Did you ever think about killing yourself?</string>
  <string id="6163456">I could ask you the same thing.</string>
  <string id="6163459">I'm serious. To get out of slavery, to escape Danarius... don't tell me you never thought about it.</string>
  <string id="6163462">I did not. To kill oneself is a sin in the eyes of the Maker.</string>
  <string id="6163465">I try to. Some things must be worse than slavery.</string>
  <string id="6163468">Some things are worse than death.</string>
  <string id="6163469">Do you still support the knight-commander?</string>
  <string id="6163472">I don't care a fig for her. But she's the only one holding back the madness in this city.</string>
  <string id="6163475">Holding back? She's howling at the bloody moon!</string>
  <string id="6163478">Even her own people think she's lost it.</string>
  <string id="6163481">What will it take for you to see that she's crazy?</string>
  <string id="6163484">Mages in glass houses shouldn't throw fireballs.</string>
  <string id="6163488">You were an idiot to leave Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6163491">And you were fast enough to replace me.</string>
  <string id="6163494">I love her.</string>
  <string id="6163497">I love him.</string>
  <string id="6163500">You can't even imagine what that is.</string>
  <string id="6163503">Do not bare your heart to me, mage. Unless you would see me rip it out.</string>
  <string id="6163506">I can't imagine what Hawke sees in you.</string>
  <string id="6163509">It is done. Leave it be.</string>
  <string id="6163512">Well, good. I always knew she had some sense.</string>
  <string id="6163515">Well, good. I always knew he had some sense.</string>
  <string id="6163518">Do not make light of this. Leaving was the hardest thing I've ever done.</string>
  <string id="6163524">Oh, will you two get over yourselves?</string>
  <string id="6163530">I did her, too.</string>
  <string id="6163531">I did him, too.</string>
  <string id="6163532">You're like two dogs around a bitch in heat.</string>
  <string id="6163535">We were talking about Hawke. Not you.</string>
  <string id="6163538">Templar Archer</string>
  <string id="6163543">You're Fereldan, right? Ever spend time at the Pearl?</string>
  <string id="6163546">That's it!</string>
  <string id="6163549">You used to really like that girl with the griffon tattoos, right? What was her name?</string>
  <string id="6163552">The Lay Warden?</string>
  <string id="6163555">That's right! I think you were there the night I—</string>
  <string id="6163558">Oh! Were you the runaway mage who could do that electricity thing? That was nice...</string>
  <string id="6163561">I don't think I need to know this about either of you.</string>
  <string id="6163562">Please stop talking. Now.</string>
  <string id="6163565">Handcuffs, whipped cream, always be on top?</string>
  <string id="6163568">I never used to give two bits what anyone thought of me.</string>
  <string id="6163571">Justice once asked me why I didn't do more for other mages. I told him it was too much work.</string>
  <string id="6163574">But I couldn't go back after that. Couldn't stop thinking about it.</string>
  <string id="6163577">Sometimes, I miss being that selfish.</string>
  <string id="6163580">Huh? Were you talking? I was still at whipped cream.</string>
  <string id="6163583">About what?</string>
  <string id="6163586">Anything? Everything? I can't figure you out.</string>
  <string id="6163595">This place feels strange. Wrong.</string>
  <string id="6163598">You've been here before, haven't you?</string>
  <string id="6163601">Haven't we been here before?</string>
  <string id="6163604">This is where you found the human remains all those years ago. We should've known there was something else here.</string>
  <string id="6163605">I wonder if we'll find more than just a sack of bones this time.</string>
  <string id="6163606">Don't you remember? You found Ninette's hand here.</string>
  <string id="6163607">I found Ninette's hand and the sack of human remains here three years ago.</string>
  <string id="6163610">The same thing that makes anything valuable. Someone's willing to pay for it.</string>
  <string id="6163615">The past's past. I learned that young. If it can't bring you gold or giggles, what's the point in dwelling on it?</string>
  <string id="6163618">Maybe the chance to fix a mistake? Make things right again?</string>
  <string id="6163621">Eh. Our mistakes make us who we are.</string>
  <string id="6163634">That's not evasive.</string>
  <string id="6163637">Look, I didn't get where I am by showing my hand, you know? </string>
  <string id="6163640">No, your hand isn't what I hear you've been showing.</string>
  <string id="6163643">Hey! You take that back!</string>
  <string id="6163646">You had your relic. You were gone. There was no reason for you to come back and face the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6163649">I still don't have a ship. I thought I could get one.</string>
  <string id="6163652">From a bunch of shipwrecked Qunari?</string>
  <string id="6163655">From the viscount. I just got here late.</string>
  <string id="6163658">I always knew you had a heart of gold.</string>
  <string id="6163664">Shh! Don't tell anyone.</string>
  <string id="6163669">I am a repeatable encounter, you know.</string>
  <string id="6163672">My, my... it looks like we have a hardened adventurer here.</string>
  <string id="6163675">Let's go. I'll let you roll for initiative.</string>
  <string id="6163678">Screw me if I'm wrong, but haven't we met before?</string>
  <string id="6163681">Why don't we go play Slay the Dragon?</string>
  <string id="6163684">I've got the ship, you've got the harbor. Let's tie up for the night.</string>
  <string id="6163688">Sorry, no one is allowed to see the viscount uninvited.</string>
  <string id="6163692">The viscount is busy at the moment. He has no time for unannounced visitors.</string>
  <string id="6163696">Over here. Look!</string>
  <string id="6163697">Here! There's a trapdoor.</string>
  <string id="6163698">I'm guessing this leads somewhere.</string>
  <string id="6163717">The viscount told me to let you right in.</string>
  <string id="6163720">I told you, I only like to be on top.</string>
  <string id="6163723">I mean against the templars! You like freedom, right? You hate slavery.</string>
  <string id="6163726">Why wouldn't you side with the mages?</string>
  <string id="6163729">Maybe I just don't like you.</string>
  <string id="6163732">You cut yourself and realized the power? You didn't actually deal with a demon?</string>
  <string id="6163735">Oh, no. I did. </string>
  <string id="6163738">Why would you do that?</string>
  <string id="6163741">I needed his help. He was really very nice about it.</string>
  <string id="6163744">Of course he was! He's using you to get a foothold in a mortal brain!</string>
  <string id="6163747">He's a spirit. He offered me his aid. I hardly think you're one to criticize.</string>
  <string id="6163750">Did I ask you?</string>
  <string id="6163753">Spirits were the first children of the Maker, but He turned His back on them to dote on His mortal creations.</string>
  <string id="6163756">The ones who resented this became demons, driven to take everything mortals had and gain back the Maker's favor.</string>
  <string id="6163759">Your Maker is a story you humans use to explain the world.</string>
  <string id="6163762">We have our own stories. I don't need to borrow yours.</string>
  <string id="6163765">We've never thought of the Fade as the home of our gods.</string>
  <string id="6163768">It is another realm, another people's home. No different or more foreign than, say, Orzammar.</string>
  <string id="6163771">You can say that again.</string>
  <string id="6163774">But have you never studied the types of demons? They break down very clearly into different sins—</string>
  <string id="6163777">Spirits differ from each other, just as you and Hawke and Isabela are all human.</string>
  <string id="6163780">More or less...</string>
  <string id="6163781">Looks like someone forgot to conceal the door to his hideout.</string>
  <string id="6163782">Looks like your killer might be hiding under the foundry.</string>
  <string id="6163783">Ooh, a door!</string>
  <string id="6163787">This wasn't here before.</string>
  <string id="6163788">Mother must be down there. With him.</string>
  <string id="6163796">Good day, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6163797">I doubt Seneschal Bran wants visitors, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6163808">Please move on, serah. The viscount won't be seeing you today.</string>
  <string id="6163815">Go right in, serah. The viscount is waiting for you.</string>
  <string id="6163816">Good day, serah.</string>
  <string id="6163824">Hello again, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6163826">I doubt Seneschal Bran is in the mood to see anyone right now, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6163832">Look at this handsome lad.</string>
  <string id="6163835">And look at this stunning vision.</string>
  <string id="6163838">Giggles You know, it's my nameday. Want to buy me a drink?</string>
  <string id="6163841">No.</string>
  <string id="6163858">What?</string>
  <string id="6163861">Being an abomination. I just got a taste of your future.</string>
  <string id="6163864">I'm not that foolish. Our relationship is, um, strictly platonic.</string>
  <string id="6163867">It's like you're trapped in your own body, seeing out your eyes, while someone else moves you like a puppet.</string>
  <string id="6163870">And you're trying to scream, to move a single muscle, but there's no escape. Until you look down at the blood on your hands...</string>
  <string id="6163873">Stop it. You're scaring me.</string>
  <string id="6163876">That's the point.</string>
  <string id="6163879">It was my risk to take! I never asked her to do this for me.</string>
  <string id="6163882">She knew you didn't have the strength to resist the demon. That's why it picked you.</string>
  <string id="6163885">Why are you doing this? What can I do about it now?</string>
  <string id="6163888">Make up for your mistakes. Most blood mages never get a second chance.</string>
  <string id="6163894">It's not my fight.</string>
  <string id="6163897">You can't hide in Sundermount.</string>
  <string id="6163900">Your clan is dead.</string>
  <string id="6163903">There is no place for you among the Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6163906">No! My clan is all I ever cared about! Everything I did, I did for them!</string>
  <string id="6163909">On second thought, maybe don't try to help us.</string>
  <string id="6163969">Just wondering if the feathered pauldrons are an essential part of the moody rebel mage persona.</string>
  <string id="6163972">What are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="6163975">I'm working on an epic poem about a hopelessly romantic apostate waging an epic struggle against forces he can't possibly defeat.</string>
  <string id="6163978">What do you mean, can't possibly defeat?</string>
  <string id="6163981">Well, it's not a good story unless the hero dies.</string>
  <string id="6163984">Where were they trying to go?</string>
  <string id="6163987">Anywhere but here.</string>
  <string id="6163990">I mean, you have to question the collective sanity of people who live in a city powered by raw lava running through its walls.</string>
  <string id="6163993">So, you're not having any warm dwarven feelings of homecoming?</string>
  <string id="6163996">The only road Orzammar needs points straight up.</string>
  <string id="6163999">Too prosaic. Trapped in a cave with hungry bears, right at the spring thaw.</string>
  <string id="6164002">That lets him off too easy. Dipped in molten gold and left as a statue in the Viscount's Keep.</string>
  <string id="6164005">Ooh. That's poetic!</string>
  <string id="6164008">What are you two talking about?</string>
  <string id="6164011">What to do to Bartrand when I find him.</string>
  <string id="6164014">Any suggestions?</string>
  <string id="6164017">Don't.</string>
  <string id="6164020">You made a mistake. It happens.</string>
  <string id="6164023">I killed a girl.</string>
  <string id="6164026">I almost killed a girl.</string>
  <string id="6164029">You've killed two-hundred and fifty-four by my last count. Plus about five hundred men, a few dozen giant spiders, and at least two demons.</string>
  <string id="6164032">It's not the same.</string>
  <string id="6164035">Why? Because this one you feel bad about? Maybe that's the problem.</string>
  <string id="6164038">So, you and Hawke... I need some details. Did you go down on one knee?</string>
  <string id="6164041">Did she jump you?</string>
  <string id="6164044">Did he jump you?</string>
  <string id="6164047">Did you swear eternal vows of love, or is this just a physical thing?</string>
  <string id="6164050">I don't see how that's any of your business.</string>
  <string id="6164053">Fine. But if you don't tell me, I'm just going to have to make it up.</string>
  <string id="6164056">This is past time for joking.</string>
  <string id="6164059">I'm helping you indulge in elaborate revenge fantasies. I think it's good for you.</string>
  <string id="6164062">Meredith will die. Do not doubt that.</string>
  <string id="6164065">Go away, Justice. Can Anders come out and play?</string>
  <string id="6164068">Stop.</string>
  <string id="6164071">You are no fun anymore.</string>
  <string id="6164076">Lyrium Smuggler Archer</string>
  <string id="6164082">But I thought Gascard DuPuis was the one responsible. We executed him.</string>
  <string id="6164083">Gascard must have been innocent.</string>
  <string id="6164084">We've made a terrible mistake.</string>
  <string id="6164085">Could he have been playing dead?</string>
  <string id="6164086">Are you sure?</string>
  <string id="6164087">Gascard probably deserved it, but it doesn't change the fact that my mother's gone.</string>
  <string id="6164088">He had it coming.</string>
  <string id="6164113">Speak to Emeric in the Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6164148">He confessed to kidnapping and blood magic. His death was deserved.</string>
  <string id="6164151">I am sure, serah. He was beheaded.</string>
  <string id="6164174">Ha-ha!</string>
  <string id="6164177">Don't fall over!</string>
  <string id="6164180">Hey mister! You all right?</string>
  <string id="6164183">Bloody brats.</string>
  <string id="6164184">Get!</string>
  <string id="6164185">Bah. The less children the better, I say.</string>
  <string id="6164189">Where are your parents, young man?</string>
  <string id="6164192">How should I know?</string>
  <string id="6164193">You return home to your parents this instant!</string>
  <string id="6164196">No way! Pa's drunk and Mother has company.</string>
  <string id="6164197">The Maker will know if you misbehave, child.</string>
  <string id="6164200">Does He always know?</string>
  <string id="6164201">Sighs Maker watch over fools and children alike.</string>
  <string id="6164205">Keep your distance, you shifty ragamuffin.</string>
  <string id="6164208">Scoffs Blighter.</string>
  <string id="6164209">I see you lurking there.</string>
  <string id="6164212">I didn't do anything.</string>
  <string id="6164213">Don't you children have homes?</string>
  <string id="6164216">Bet they're not as nice as yours!</string>
  <string id="6164223">Bloody Fereldans! Who asked you to come, anyway?</string>
  <string id="6164227">Did you really go all the way into the Deep Roads?</string>
  <string id="6164231">Look! It's the Champion!</string>
  <string id="6164232">I wish I could've helped you kill all those oxmen!</string>
  <string id="6164236">Don't look now. Here comes another one.</string>
  <string id="6164237">I'm just standing here. Don't look at me.</string>
  <string id="6164238">Why you running around with all that stuff?</string>
  <string id="6164239">Who are you looking at?</string>
  <string id="6164240">A Scribbled Note</string>
  <string id="6164249">Used quicklime to preserve her feet. Unsure whether texture of the skin is to my liking. Will try other methods.</string>
  <string id="6164254">These were part of some necromantic ritual. I'm close now.</string>
  <string id="6164262">Bone Pit Mines</string>
  <string id="6164271">Champion! Could I interest you or your companions in some new armor?</string>
  <string id="6164272">Spend some of your hard-earned coin here, Champion!</string>
  <string id="6164276">A veteran of the Deep Roads right there, ladies and gentlemen!</string>
  <string id="6164277">An adventurer! Do you need new armor? Anything at all?</string>
  <string id="6164281">Don't get stabbed again! Buy armor today!</string>
  <string id="6164282">Quality armor! The best outside of Orzammar!</string>
  <string id="6164283">Of course! Of course! Look around!</string>
  <string id="6164284">Anything you need. If it protects your body, I have it.</string>
  <string id="6164292">Gather round, all. I bring to you a priceless treasure! From the highest heights of Mount Daverus it's traveled.</string>
  <string id="6164297">That was almost profound.</string>
  <string id="6164309">Necromancy. And here I thought I was twisted.</string>
  <string id="6164310">This is quite a collection of books. Blood magic, necromancy... where did he get all these?</string>
  <string id="6164311">Books on necromancy. The templars will want to confiscate those.</string>
  <string id="6164314">What a surprise.</string>
  <string id="6164315">Necromantic rituals? What terrible things are going on down here?</string>
  <string id="6164316">A mage who plays with dead people. Charming.</string>
  <string id="6164317">Necromancy. This man is dabbling in some dangerous magic.</string>
  <string id="6164333">A Scribbled Note</string>
  <string id="6164334">Mharen… it's a pretty name. I saw her hands. Long, slender fingers. Fair skin—the hands of a lifelong scholar. Oh, to lock my own clumsy fingers in hers again... </string>
  <string id="6164335">The Fereldan, eh?</string>
  <string id="6164338">A Scribbled Note</string>
  <string id="6164346">If it isn't the Champion!</string>
  <string id="6164347">Might you need a new outfit, Champion?</string>
  <string id="6164348">Messere! Surely an adventurer has need of a good tailor!</string>
  <string id="6164349">One so wealthy could use a new pair of boots, yes?</string>
  <string id="6164353">Clothing of all kinds!</string>
  <string id="6164354">The finest clothing from here to Antiva!</string>
  <string id="6164355">You won't find better prices!</string>
  <string id="6164356">Another customer! Come, take a look!</string>
  <string id="6164357">You'll find that everything is of the highest quality!</string>
  <string id="6164359">The craziest thing. Apparently, the pigeon population has taken a nose dive in Ferelden. Weird, huh?</string>
  <string id="6164362">What kind of sick individual preys on those innocent things?</string>
  <string id="6164388">Today is our anniversary. Had hoped to complete my work before now, but one piece is missing. I'm so sorry, love. Please wait a little longer. I haven't forgotten my promise.&#13;
&#13;
When I see it, I'll know. I would know that face anywhere.</string>
  <string id="6164391">A Letter from the Circle</string>
  <string id="6164395">You look like you know your way around a weapon. Buy something.</string>
  <string id="6164396">Hey! Adventurer! Come replace your old crap.</string>
  <string id="6164397">Need someplace to spend your coin? Do it here.</string>
  <string id="6164402">You need to kill someone? Try stabbing them.</string>
  <string id="6164403">You want swords? I got swords.</string>
  <string id="6164404">You want bows? I got bows.</string>
  <string id="6164405">You want daggers? Got them, too.</string>
  <string id="6164406">Got an eye for weaponry, hey? Good.</string>
  <string id="6164407">Just don't touch anything.</string>
  <string id="6164411">Snickers</string>
  <string id="6164414">Snickers</string>
  <string id="6164417">What?</string>
  <string id="6164424">I heard you rescued Keran. Thanks for looking out for us.</string>
  <string id="6164425">You convinced the knight-captain to toss out Keran. Get out of here!</string>
  <string id="6164426">I can't wait until I've had enough training to meet a real mage!</string>
  <string id="6164432">I just tried the lyrium. It made me feel... tingly.</string>
  <string id="6164433">My parents were so proud the day I joined the Order.</string>
  <string id="6164434">Maker watch over you.</string>
  <string id="6164435">Don't worry. We've got everything under control.</string>
  <string id="6164436">We have sword drills in the morning and study the Chant in the afternoon.</string>
  <string id="6164439">Why are we not leading a force against the heathens?</string>
  <string id="6164440">My mother wants me to leave the Order before we march on the Qunari. She doesn't think I can handle it.</string>
  <string id="6164443">Mages have been confined to their quarters. Please direct inquiries to Knight-Captain Cullen.</string>
  <string id="6164444">My dear friend,&#13;
&#13;
I have obtained the books you requested. I'll leave them at our usual hiding spot. Please collect them as soon as possible. I would hate to see them in the wrong hands!&#13;
&#13;
Your last letter was fascinating! You have proven me wrong, once again, by doing the impossible. I shouldn't have doubted your resolve, and I hope you will keep me apprised of further progress.&#13;
&#13;
Your friend and colleague,&#13;
O</string>
  <string id="6164447">We're brothers. What's eerie about that?</string>
  <string id="6164450">She's my sister. Of course there's a resemblance.</string>
  <string id="6164453">Oh, you thought I meant Hawke? I was talking about Gamlen.</string>
  <string id="6164456">Maker, I hate you, dwarf.</string>
  <string id="6164457">Clearly this enchantment was performed by one less studious.</string>
  <string id="6164458">Why does the knight-commander not permit us to sell everything? So much is restricted.</string>
  <string id="6164459">I don't understand. It held an enchantment just yesterday.</string>
  <string id="6164460">Someone placed manure in it again? Another prank by an apprentice, I see.</string>
  <string id="6164461">Hmm. Intriguing.</string>
  <string id="6164462">Please don't spill anything. It takes many scrubbings to get the counter clean.</string>
  <string id="6164463">The enchantments are all of moderate quality, as you will see.</string>
  <string id="6164464">Cheers.</string>
  <string id="6164466">Wouldn't the Maker favor the oppressed?</string>
  <string id="6164469">Is there something wrong, child?</string>
  <string id="6164472">If you'll excuse me.</string>
  <string id="6164478">The storm was only half of it.</string>
  <string id="6164481">I also had the Qunari dreadnought stuck to my behind like a bad rash, spitting fire and thunder at me.</string>
  <string id="6164484">Snickers</string>
  <string id="6164490">Whatever it is you're about to say, I'm not interested.</string>
  <string id="6164493">I'm a professional younger brother. Trust me, the center of attention's the worst place to be.</string>
  <string id="6164496">When things go wrong, and they always do, that's where all the fingers point. Look at any kingdom in Thedas.</string>
  <string id="6164499">You've got people who warm thrones, and people nobody sees who do the real work.</string>
  <string id="6164502">So my brother is a king now? Just what he needed.</string>
  <string id="6164503">And my sister is a queen in this scenario. Perfect.</string>
  <string id="6164508">Point. Missing it. Ah well.</string>
  <string id="6164552">Sunshine, I'm a dwarf, in case you missed that detail.</string>
  <string id="6164555">Dwarves aren't completely immune to magic, you know.</string>
  <string id="6164558">No, no, no! I meant there are at least thirty people in this town who'd murder my family over trade deals.</string>
  <string id="6164561">Who has time to worry about apostates with a Merchants Guild breathing down your neck?</string>
  <string id="6164564">In that case... I see.</string>
  <string id="6164568">So.</string>
  <string id="6164571">So.</string>
  <string id="6164574">I noticed some notes on the table the other day. Interesting work you got there.</string>
  <string id="6164577">Heh. I'm doing a little writing.</string>
  <string id="6164580">What's a speed griffon? Laughs Do they zip around Thedas terrorizing darkspawn with their lightning reflexes?</string>
  <string id="6164583">Sighs</string>
  <string id="6164586">Laughs Speed griffon. Good one.</string>
  <string id="6164592">Why did you do that?</string>
  <string id="6164595">What? You mean start a fight?</string>
  <string id="6164598">Stab first, ask questions later?</string>
  <string id="6164601">I was trying to talk him down.</string>
  <string id="6164604">Trust me. It's better this way.</string>
  <string id="6164626">So he comes down wearing nothing but his boots. We have a few drinks and everyone's laughing at him, but he doesn't care...</string>
  <string id="6164629">He was naked?</string>
  <string id="6164632">Just airing things out, he said.</string>
  <string id="6164635">Ha!</string>
  <string id="6164652">Your family used to be noble, right?</string>
  <string id="6164685">I shit you not, Rivaini, it was this big.</string>
  <string id="6164688">There's no way. Impossible! I've had hundreds of those in my hands, and they're never that size.</string>
  <string id="6164691">Would I lie about something so critical?</string>
  <string id="6164694">I can't stand it anymore—what are you two talking about?</string>
  <string id="6164697">I'm afraid to ask, but... what are you two going on about?</string>
  <string id="6164700">What is wrong with you two? Can't you ever have a conversation that isn't dirty?</string>
  <string id="6164703">What are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="6164706">We're discussing knives, of course. Well, daggers, technically. I never remember the difference.</string>
  <string id="6164709">Why? What'd you think we were talking about?</string>
  <string id="6164720">A noblewoman with no fortune and no title? Looking for work, probably.</string>
  <string id="6164721">Thank the Maker for small mercies.</string>
  <string id="6164724">You really test me, you know?</string>
  <string id="6164727">Hawke. Not now.</string>
  <string id="6164730">Practicality is for peasants, my lady. You need to do something frivolous to celebrate your birthright.</string>
  <string id="6164733">Such as...?</string>
  <string id="6164736">Come up to the Hightown Market and complain bitterly that there's no Orlesian silk that matches your eyes.</string>
  <string id="6164739">But what if something does match my eyes? What will I do, then?</string>
  <string id="6164742">Insist that they're blatantly copying you, and demand royalties. A good noble always has a complaint ready, Sunshine.</string>
  <string id="6164743">My people have been slow to react, but this needs official support.</string>
  <string id="6164746">And you have doubts that they merely fled?</string>
  <string id="6164751">By some definition of the term.</string>
  <string id="6164754">Do you ever wonder what your life would have been like, if you were still nobles?</string>
  <string id="6164757">Sunshine, nobility is just an expensive lifestyle. I've already got one of those.</string>
  <string id="6164760">Nobles have power, too. And responsibilities.</string>
  <string id="6164761">The guards disagree.</string>
  <string id="6164764">They're more disagreeable than my wife! Maybe your friend is more sensible.</string>
  <string id="6164769">Estates, servants, investments, mercenaries, assassins? We've still got all those things.</string>
  <string id="6164772">It's sunnier here, and nobody calls me my lord. I think I can live with that.</string>
  <string id="6164775">How do you figure?</string>
  <string id="6164778">I would have loved to have a brother, and a mother, and an uncle.</string>
  <string id="6164781">I wish I had a sister and a whole big family.</string>
  <string id="6164784">It must be wonderful. You'd never be alone!</string>
  <string id="6164787">It is wonderful. Although it might be better without Uncle Gamlen.</string>
  <string id="6164800">Greetings, Guardsman Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6164809">Keep those weapons sheathed.</string>
  <string id="6164813">Hope everything is well, messere.</string>
  <string id="6164820">Captain!</string>
  <string id="6164823">At ease, Guardsman.</string>
  <string id="6164824">Greetings, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6164831">Good day, citizen.</string>
  <string id="6164835">Careful walking these parts at night.</string>
  <string id="6164836">Always the same, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6164837">Could've sworn I saw those elves around here somewhere.</string>
  <string id="6164838">Well, I'm not stopping until I find them.</string>
  <string id="6164841">That's easy. Be normal. No magic, just... normal.</string>
  <string id="6164844">Really? You wouldn't fly across Thedas or eat a cake the size of Kirkwall? Keep a baby griffon for a pet?</string>
  <string id="6164847">Well, now that you say it, the griffon might not be so bad.</string>
  <string id="6164850">I'd name mine Feathers.</string>
  <string id="6164874">Sometimes.</string>
  <string id="6164880">Blackberries. They don't seem to grow here. And there were little songbirds with black caps on their heads.</string>
  <string id="6164881">And you've allowed this?</string>
  <string id="6164939">I'm keeping an eye on you.</string>
  <string id="6164942">Don't let me catch you breaking the law again.</string>
  <string id="6164945">I thought I told you to stay scarce?</string>
  <string id="6164948">Yes, yes, that's what you said the last time.</string>
  <string id="6164949">Just try and threaten me again. You'll see what happens.</string>
  <string id="6164950">Like I care what you think anyhow.</string>
  <string id="6164954">Hey! Heard anything?</string>
  <string id="6164957">You think I'm going to tell you here? Don't be daft.</string>
  <string id="6164958">Looking pretty quiet today.</string>
  <string id="6164961">Should've been here earlier.</string>
  <string id="6164962">Come talk to me later. You know.</string>
  <string id="6164963">So far. Just wait until the guard clears out.</string>
  <string id="6164964">Don't suppose you've seen my girl?</string>
  <string id="6164967">Oh, get over her!</string>
  <string id="6164968">Try the Blooming Rose.</string>
  <string id="6164969">Maker's breath, you're pathetic.</string>
  <string id="6164973">You need to change your ways, young man!</string>
  <string id="6164976">The Maker's wisdom is the path we must all walk upon.</string>
  <string id="6164979">You should be ashamed, serah. What would your mother say about this behavior?</string>
  <string id="6164982">Yes, messere.</string>
  <string id="6164983">I'm sorry, messere.</string>
  <string id="6164984">I'll try to do better, messere.</string>
  <string id="6164988">Look here, another mark!</string>
  <string id="6164989">I think I just spotted my lunch.</string>
  <string id="6164990">Come to papa, you rich little bastard.</string>
  <string id="6164994">Hey darling! Looking for a good time?</string>
  <string id="6164997">Well, well, if it isn't a knife ear walking brazen as you please!</string>
  <string id="6165000">How about you come over hear and show me your ears, beautiful?</string>
  <string id="6165003">Please leave me alone.</string>
  <string id="6165004">Snorts</string>
  <string id="6165005">Stupid shemlen.</string>
  <string id="6165015">Hey? Didn't you work with the Red Iron?</string>
  <string id="6165019">You're Hawke, aren't you? You used to work with Athenril?</string>
  <string id="6165026">Lucky bastard.</string>
  <string id="6165030">Lucky bitch.</string>
  <string id="6165031">Heard you made out like a bandit in the Deep Roads.</string>
  <string id="6165035">Well, if it isn't the Champion come to grace us lowlifes!</string>
  <string id="6165036">The Champion of Kirkwall, hey? Heard you're bloody rich.</string>
  <string id="6165040">There's got to be some way to make coin around here.</string>
  <string id="6165041">Bloody guard. Think they can stop me, do they?</string>
  <string id="6165042">I should go up to Hightown, that's what. Lots of loot up there.</string>
  <string id="6165043">Just you never mind.</string>
  <string id="6165085">Hawke has denied you. You are not worthy of facing true basalit-an.</string>
  <string id="6165086">I'd love to, Isabela, but you heard the man.</string>
  <string id="6165087">Too bad.</string>
  <string id="6165093">I thought I had a sale there. I don't suppose you've a lady friend you need to impress?</string>
  <string id="6165096">Uh, who are you?</string>
  <string id="6165099">Many mages resent the history of the Gallows. It does not trouble me.</string>
  <string id="6165100">The first enchanter does not wish me to sell merchandise. He says I am too honest.</string>
  <string id="6165104">Many more of us have been given the Rite in recent days.</string>
  <string id="6165105">Ser Alrik says the Rite of Tranquility is the only thing that can keep the souls of mages from the Void.</string>
  <string id="6165109">I do not understand this desire to be free. We are safe and fed. What more can we want?</string>
  <string id="6165110">Good day, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6165114">I am glad to stand here day after day. It is... predictable.</string>
  <string id="6165115">I am fortunate to be Tranquil. So many mages are plagued by unrest.</string>
  <string id="6165116">I was never given the opportunity for a Harrowing. The knight-commander knew I was too weak.</string>
  <string id="6165117">The first enchanter has marked up these potions well beyond the cost of making them. He is trying to earn money for the Circle.</string>
  <string id="6165122">The anger from our mages is... unsettling. They would all be at peace if Ser Alrik had lived.</string>
  <string id="6165123">We must obey the knight-commander. She knows what is best for us.</string>
  <string id="6165130">I've been searching for you everywhere. You weren't in your rooms, the libraries...</string>
  <string id="6165133">We have no scheduled appointments at this time, apprentice.</string>
  <string id="6165136">No! Helena, it's me. Don't you remember me?</string>
  <string id="6165139">Of course. You are Apprentice Jaken. We were once involved in an illicit relationship.</string>
  <string id="6165142">Illicit? I love you!</string>
  <string id="6165145">I am Ser Alrik's now. He is the only one who can command me.</string>
  <string id="6165146">Ser Alrik rescued me from my sins.</string>
  <string id="6165147">So many mages here could be brought peace by the Rite. So few have experienced it.</string>
  <string id="6165148">The Usual Suspects</string>
  <string id="6165149">Search Ser Danvil Laurie's murder scene for clues.</string>
  <string id="6165154">Hey! What's going on here? Who in the Void are you?</string>
  <string id="6165158">With so many refugees, it's difficult to monitor our mages.</string>
  <string id="6165159">Knight-Captain Cullen says you're a friend of the templars. Maker's blessing on you.</string>
  <string id="6165163">These mages are getting out of control. We would do better to use the Rite of Tranquility more widely.</string>
  <string id="6165164">I report directly to Ser Alrik now.</string>
  <string id="6165165">Those damned heathens better clear out of Kirkwall before we call down the wrath of the Maker on them.</string>
  <string id="6165169">The first enchanter has overstepped his bounds.</string>
  <string id="6165173">The first enchanter is playing a dangerous game. You would do well not to help him.</string>
  <string id="6165174">The knight-commander is grateful for your support, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6165175">These mages will not be satisfied until we have hunted down and burned every last apprentice!</string>
  <string id="6165179">Maker watch over you.</string>
  <string id="6165180">Please do not converse with the mages.</string>
  <string id="6165181">This is the home of Kirkwall's Circle of Magi. I have been stationed here since I was fifteen.</string>
  <string id="6165182">If you have any questions, talk to Knight-Captain Cullen.</string>
  <string id="6165190">Enough! Release the slaves! Let them handle this riffraff.</string>
  <string id="6165197">What? You can't turn against me. I own you!</string>
  <string id="6165200">Kill the collars, too.</string>
  <string id="6165204">How dare you!</string>
  <string id="6165207">The rest of you, take care of those traitors. I'll handle the newcomers.</string>
  <string id="6165211">That should take care of you.</string>
  <string id="6165219">I don't understand all these complaints. The new knight-commander's no different than any other templar.</string>
  <string id="6165220">Maker, hear our hymn of repentance. Grant us absolution in your light.</string>
  <string id="6165224">If there weren't so many mages preaching sedition, the templars would not feel so compelled to use the Rite of Tranquility.</string>
  <string id="6165225">Why do so many mages insist on running away from the Circle. Where do they think they'll go?</string>
  <string id="6165229">The first enchanter is insane if he thinks he can take on Knight-Commander Meredith.</string>
  <string id="6165233">It's kind of you to defend us, Champion, but your support is misplaced.</string>
  <string id="6165234">Maybe your voice joined to the knight-commander's will be enough to quiet this rebellion.</string>
  <string id="6165235">That Anders will be the death of us all!</string>
  <string id="6165239">Kirkwall may not have the best Circle, but at least we're not Fereldan.</string>
  <string id="6165240">Andraste herself said magic is curse. We're lucky to have a way to combat demonic influences through the love of the Maker.</string>
  <string id="6165241">It's not so bad here.</string>
  <string id="6165242">It is the duty of every mage to train in the Circle so we do not bring danger to our homes.</string>
  <string id="6165243">People talk about the Circle like it's a prison. It's no different than anywhere in Thedas.</string>
  <string id="6165246">Slaver Assassin</string>
  <string id="6165250">Come again.</string>
  <string id="6165254">Help! Please! I never did anything!</string>
  <string id="6165255">Let me out of here!</string>
  <string id="6165256">Please! Help me! Anyone!</string>
  <string id="6165260">Oh, thank the Maker!</string>
  <string id="6165261">Praise the Maker! Bless you!</string>
  <string id="6165265">I don't serve you!</string>
  <string id="6165266">Die, you bastard!</string>
  <string id="6165267">You don't own me!</string>
  <string id="6165271">Not a chance, bastard! I'm a free man now!</string>
  <string id="6165272">Aaah! Get out of here!</string>
  <string id="6165273">Who in the Void are you? Get away from me!</string>
  <string id="6165277">I'm gonna earn my freedom!</string>
  <string id="6165278">Yes, Master!</string>
  <string id="6165279">Get out of here! This is none of your business!</string>
  <string id="6165284">Take care of these meddlers.</string>
  <string id="6165287">You'll regret ever coming here.</string>
  <string id="6165291">Hey... I thought I heard something.</string>
  <string id="6165294">Slave</string>
  <string id="6165298">Slave</string>
  <string id="6165303">Slave</string>
  <string id="6165309">I have fourteen different reports to rewrite by the end of the day.</string>
  <string id="6165312">Please, I need some quiet.</string>
  <string id="6165313">Don't touch anything! I've arranged all of the papers alphabetically!</string>
  <string id="6165314">Nothing like the smell of fresh ink! So invigorating.</string>
  <string id="6165318">You're from Ferelden? What's the Circle like there? I hear it's better...</string>
  <string id="6165319">I wish there was a way out of here.</string>
  <string id="6165320">Now that Starkhaven's burnt down, this is the only Circle of Magi in the Free Marches.</string>
  <string id="6165324">Have you heard anything about a... mage underground? I hear they'll smuggle people out of the city.</string>
  <string id="6165325">I heard Ser Alrik place the order for me to be made Tranquil. I passed my Harrowing! He can't do that!</string>
  <string id="6165326">Ser Alrik is dead. Praise the Maker.</string>
  <string id="6165333">Thank you for speaking out for us, Champion. Maybe people will listen to you.</string>
  <string id="6165334">Didn't you embarrass the first enchanter enough? What are you doing here?</string>
  <string id="6165335">The city is turning against the knight-commander. We will win this!</string>
  <string id="6165336">Kirkwall will be remembered as the first city in Thedas to set its mages free!</string>
  <string id="6165340">This place is a prison.</string>
  <string id="6165341">Don't talk to me. The templars will give me thirty lashes for speaking to a civilian.</string>
  <string id="6165342">My best friend just failed his Harrowing. They killed him on the spot.</string>
  <string id="6165343">There has to be a better way.</string>
  <string id="6165344">Knight-Commander Meredith would kill us all if she could.</string>
  <string id="6165345">I wish the guards weren't so illiterate.</string>
  <string id="6165348">I had a report come in this morning that was nothing but a bunch of X's.</string>
  <string id="6165354">I was.</string>
  <string id="6165361">Did you... did you ever meet a Dalish Warden? Mahariel?</string>
  <string id="6165365">As a matter of fact, I did.</string>
  <string id="6165366">I met a Warden once. Back in Ferelden. Duncan, I think his name was. Very odd man.</string>
  <string id="6165367">No. I had a friend who did, though. Told the most impossible stories.</string>
  <string id="6165376">I'd like to hear them, sometime. If you don't mind.</string>
  <string id="6165383">Um... you're in my light.</string>
  <string id="6165386">Do I come to where you work and stand in your light?</string>
  <string id="6165387">You are getting mud on my floor.</string>
  <string id="6165388">Ow! Parchment cut!</string>
  <string id="6165389">You're part of the Amell family, aren't you?</string>
  <string id="6165392">I had a report come in recently concerning your uncle. He's a... colorful chap to say the least.</string>
  <string id="6165403">Do you know him?</string>
  <string id="6165406">He was one of my clan. I'd known him... almost all my life.</string>
  <string id="6165409">Do you know her?</string>
  <string id="6165412">We grew up together. She was one of my clan.</string>
  <string id="6165415">I keep hoping to hear some news...</string>
  <string id="6165421">I wouldn't get your hopes up. The Hero of Ferelden values privacy rather highly.</string>
  <string id="6165424">He had a marvelous beard, though. I'd never seen one before. I thought a squirrel had grabbed him by the chin.</string>
  <string id="6165425">Abandoned Ruins</string>
  <string id="6165427">Abandoned Ruins</string>
  <string id="6165428">Abandoned Ruins</string>
  <string id="6165432">Is that a serious question?</string>
  <string id="6165435">Did he have a little sword, or just his claws? I bet he had a dashing cap with a feather in it!</string>
  <string id="6165436">No, I didn't mean...</string>
  <string id="6165439">I don't know why you're here, but there's a killer out there, and I think he's playing us both!</string>
  <string id="6165442">Just... just let me explain!</string>
  <string id="6165443">You don't have to be afraid. I'll hear what you have to say.</string>
  <string id="6165444">Calm down.</string>
  <string id="6165445">All right, we'll see if you can talk yourself out of this.</string>
  <string id="6165446">This I have to hear.</string>
  <string id="6165447">If I hear anything I don't like, you're dead.</string>
  <string id="6165448">Talk quickly.</string>
  <string id="6165451">Would you stop making fun of my cat?</string>
  <string id="6165454">Oh... no hat, then?</string>
  <string id="6165457">Hawke, we need you! Ser Danvil Laurie's been murdered.</string>
  <string id="6165464">With the Tome of Koslun's return to the Arishok, the Qunari voluntarily left Kirkwall—with Isabela in tow. Further bloodshed has been averted.</string>
  <string id="6165469">Are you happy?</string>
  <string id="6165472">Beg your pardon?</string>
  <string id="6165475">He seems happy. Hawke, I mean. Are you?</string>
  <string id="6165478">Because she seems happy. Hawke, I mean. You are, aren't you?</string>
  <string id="6165481">Yes, I suppose I am.</string>
  <string id="6165485">Good! You've spent much too much time being grumpy. It's a nice change.</string>
  <string id="6165486">Would you like to have one of the Fenris home base dialogues, one of his initiated dialogues, or one of his mage crisis dialogues?</string>
  <string id="6165487">Home base dialogue</string>
  <string id="6165488">Home base</string>
  <string id="6165489">Which Home Base dialogue?</string>
  <string id="6165490">Act 1</string>
  <string id="6165491">Act 1, after recruitment</string>
  <string id="6165492">Act 2</string>
  <string id="6165493">Act 2</string>
  <string id="6165494">Act 3</string>
  <string id="6165495">Act 3</string>
  <string id="6165496">Back</string>
  <string id="6165497">Back</string>
  <string id="6165498">Initiated dialogue</string>
  <string id="6165499">Initiated dialogue</string>
  <string id="6165505">Saemus</string>
  <string id="6165521">Gaps? I know it seems strange, but truth is often stranger than fiction.</string>
  <string id="6165524">I meant gaps in time. What did the Champion do all those years after the Deep Roads, for instance? Take up knitting?</string>
  <string id="6165527">Well that, my dear Seeker, is a different story completely.</string>
  <string id="6165530">Lots? Some days you couldn't swing a dead cat without hitting one.</string>
  <string id="6165533">For all Meredith's measures, it seems her templars were largely ineffectual.</string>
  <string id="6165536">You're right! All the other templars are so good at their jobs that there couldn't possibly be any apostates they don't know about.</string>
  <string id="6165539">Varric, you make it sound like blood mages dance the Remigold through Lowtown on a nightly basis.</string>
  <string id="6165542">Oh, I already told you about that, did I?</string>
  <string id="6165545">I have to think! I can't remember everything at the drop of a hat, you know.</string>
  <string id="6165549">Better and better...</string>
  <string id="6165550">Most excellent.</string>
  <string id="6165551">I am well pleased.</string>
  <string id="6165555">Such arrogance. Would you achieve greatness by violence? I will show you the way.</string>
  <string id="6165559">Da'len?</string>
  <string id="6165562">You've beaten it, da'len. You are so much stronger than I imagined. The demon is dead.</string>
  <string id="6165563">Welcome back, Keeper. Let's get out of here.</string>
  <string id="6165564">I'm glad that's over.</string>
  <string id="6165565">I can hardly believe that's the end of it.</string>
  <string id="6165568">It's truly over.</string>
  <string id="6165574">Such delicious vanity...</string>
  <string id="6165577">You told us that the demon was bound to your life. It would only die with you.</string>
  <string id="6165578">You said you had to die.</string>
  <string id="6165579">Ir abelas, Keeper.</string>
  <string id="6165593">Seneschal Bran</string>
  <string id="6165597">You don't pay attention to templars, Qunari, or politics, but you notice kittens?</string>
  <string id="6165599">It starts with a bouquet of white lilies. He sends them to each new victim. Alessa was going to be next.</string>
  <string id="6165605">Templars, Qunari, and politics don't meow and attack your feet when you're buying food.</string>
  <string id="6165608">Are there any tabbies? I'd like a tabby.</string>
  <string id="6165617">Swording?</string>
  <string id="6165620">Those things you do with the sword. It looks tricky. Was it hard to learn?</string>
  <string id="6165623">It takes a lot of practice.</string>
  <string id="6165626">Well, you seem good at it! I bet one day you'll be the best sworder in Kirkwall!</string>
  <string id="6165629">I sort of miss the dogs barking.</string>
  <string id="6165632">Yes! It's mostly been humans barking at me here. Not nearly as cute.</string>
  <string id="6165633">Well, pardon my dog for breathing! If you think you can stop him, be my guest.</string>
  <string id="6165634">Why don't you?</string>
  <string id="6165635">That's enough, boy. You showed him who's boss.</string>
  <string id="6165636">Stop it.</string>
  <string id="6165637">Barks</string>
  <string id="6165641">You can go.</string>
  <string id="6165642">Get out of my sight.</string>
  <string id="6165645">Time for you to vanish. Every man for himself.</string>
  <string id="6165648">Nice story, but I don't buy it.</string>
  <string id="6165651">You're lying, and I don't like liars.</string>
  <string id="6165654">I'm sorry, but it doesn't add up. I can't let you go.</string>
  <string id="6165659">Merrill...</string>
  <string id="6165662">I said something wrong again, didn't I? Maybe I'll just stop talking.</string>
  <string id="6165663">Selfish little shit. How many have you risked by keeping this to yourself?</string>
  <string id="6165664">Which Act 2 Dialogue would you like?</string>
  <string id="6165665">Act 2 Opening Dialogue</string>

  <string id="6165682">Darktown.</string>
  <string id="6165683">He didn't tell me where he was going.</string>
  <string id="6165684">No.</string>
  <string id="6165685">Let's hope he's not the killer, then. We'll track Gascard down, just to be safe.</string>
  <string id="6165688">Gascard was only a small piece of the puzzle. I think he's innocent.</string>

  <string id="6165702">Barks</string>
  <string id="6165706">Happy bark!</string>
  <string id="6165709">You expect me to just let you walk out of here?</string>
  <string id="6165710">Why should I let you go?</string>
  <string id="6165711">Please, serah! I was seduced by crime at a very young age. But your guard-monster has scared me towards a path of honest work!</string>
  <string id="6165722">Huffs</string>
  <string id="6165723">I'll let you sleep.</string>
  <string id="6165724">Sweet dreams, boy.</string>
  <string id="6165725">Huffs</string>
  <string id="6165728">Yawns</string>
  <string id="6165733">Wake up! You've got a job to do.</string>
  <string id="6165734">Pay attention!</string>
  <string id="6165737">Come on, boy! This is no time to play dead.</string>
  <string id="6165738">Wake up, sleepyhead!</string>
  <string id="6165743">You're doing a nice job scraping the grime off these old floorboards!</string>
  <string id="6165744">Good boy!</string>
  <string id="6165745">Are you searching for buried treasure, or just trying to tunnel out of this hovel?</string>
  <string id="6165746">You won't find anything.</string>
  <string id="6165747">Happy bark!</string>
  <string id="6165753">If you're sharpening your claws for our foes, keep at it.</string>
  <string id="6165754">Carry on.</string>
  <string id="6165755">Growls</string>
  <string id="6165762">Shall we take this outside and see if it floats?</string>
  <string id="6165763">You want to play?</string>
  <string id="6165764">Whines</string>
  <string id="6165767">This isn't a toy. Somewhere out there, a table is mourning the loss of its leg.</string>
  <string id="6165768">I'll take that.</string>
  <string id="6165769">Happy bark!</string>
  <string id="6165775">No time for games, boy. You need to be on guard.</string>
  <string id="6165776">Get back to work.</string>
  <string id="6165777">Whimpers</string>
  <string id="6165780">The Midnight Meeting</string>
  <string id="6165781">I have noticed your considerable talents and have an opportunity that may be of interest to you. Meet me in Hightown at midnight. Discretion is key.&#13;
&#13;
-A new friend</string>
  <string id="6165783">Meet with an anonymous friend at midnight in Hightown, and find out what opportunity might be extended.</string>
  <string id="6165784">The midnight meeting was a set up by a vengeful templar. The other templars were dealt with.</string>
  <string id="6165788">Templar Lieutenant</string>
  <string id="6165790">Surely those in power will believe you now.</string>
  <string id="6165793">Can't imagine who.</string>
  <string id="6165796">I can't imagine why she might run away.</string>
  <string id="6165799">Yes, yes, my wife and I don't get along. But that's not the important thing!</string>
  <string id="6165888">Templar Archer</string>
  <string id="6165903">You Fereldans took all the good spots in the market.</string>
  <string id="6165907">Mama says that if I don't be good, the oxmen'll come through the window at night and get me.</string>
  <string id="6165914">You stink!</string>
  <string id="6165917">You aren't exactly smelling of roses either, brat.</string>
  <string id="6165918">It's the Champion!</string>
  <string id="6165925">I wish my shoes still had soles.</string>
  <string id="6165929">The streets are always so still when you're around.</string>
  <string id="6165930">I'm hungry.</string>
  <string id="6165931">I wonder if there are any cats left around here. I'm sick of eating rat.</string>
  <string id="6165932">I wish I was an elf. Then I'd run away and live with the Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6165935">Templar</string>
  <string id="6165937">Stay where you are! There is no escape!</string>
  <string id="6165959">Now where is pa supposed to beg?</string>
  <string id="6165964">But wouldn't their horns get stuck halfway through?</string>
  <string id="6165966">All... all right. That girl will know what to do.</string>
  <string id="6165969">It doesn't hurt to be optimistic.</string>
  <string id="6165970">Let's hope so.</string>
  <string id="6165971">Ignoring the facts doesn't change them.</string>
  <string id="6165972">Denial isn't going to work.</string>
  <string id="6165973">You don't know for sure that she's in trouble.</string>
  <string id="6165985">I don't like it. My men will find Leandra.</string>
  <string id="6165986">But when will they find her? My magic can lead us straight to her, right now.</string>
  <string id="6165990">Norah</string>
  <string id="6165996">Carver</string>
  <string id="6166002">Having family might be more worthwhile than you think.</string>
  <string id="6166005">Your father is nothing like Hawke. He is, however, still your family.</string>
  <string id="6166008">My mother was family. Gamlen is just some worthless ass who knocked her up.</string>
  <string id="6166014">And sometimes not even then.</string>
  <string id="6166017">I wouldn't go that far... usually.</string>
  <string id="6166020">Which initiated dialogue?</string>
  <string id="6166021">Entering the Gallows for the first time.</string>
  <string id="6166022">Entering the Gallows</string>
  <string id="6166023">At the player's home.</string>
  <string id="6166024">Act 2 Post Plot Dialogue</string>
  <string id="6166025">At the player's home.</string>
  <string id="6166026">Act 2 Romance Dialogue</string>
  <string id="6166027">At the player's home.</string>
  <string id="6166028">Post-Sex dialogue</string>
  <string id="6166034">Talkative Man</string>
  <string id="6166102">It will lead us straight to the killer.</string>
  <string id="6166111">I knew a man who dressed up in his wife's clothing. He had so much fun with it.</string>
  <string id="6166112">That's strange. I haven't seen any sign of a woman's touch in this house. Whose clothes are these?</string>
  <string id="6166113">Perhaps these belong to a family member?</string>
  <string id="6166114">Those clothes are so fine! They must be very valuable.</string>
  <string id="6166115">Why's he keeping these things around? I thought Gascard lived alone.</string>
  <string id="6166116">Hmm. Women's clothing. Perhaps they were taken off the murdered women.</string>
  <string id="6166154">What... What am I doing?</string>
  <string id="6166155">No! This isn't right...</string>
  <string id="6166156">Wait. This isn't how it's supposed to happen...</string>
  <string id="6166169">This is your best chance to save your people.</string>
  <string id="6166172">Don't stand in my way, Hawke!</string>
  <string id="6166173">Will you show yourself a slave who is too weak to fight?</string>
  <string id="6166176">Never!</string>
  <string id="6166177">This is your story. Will you play the victor or the fool?</string>
  <string id="6166180">This ends here, Hawke!</string>
  <string id="6166189">Squeaky wheel gets the grease!</string>
  <string id="6166190">That's polite, for Meredith. Someone must have written it for her.</string>
  <string id="6166191">I remember this. Gascard made a big fuss about the raid.</string>
  <string id="6166192">Poor Emeric. No one believed him.</string>
  <string id="6166193">An apology from Kirkwall's iron lady? That must have been a first.</string>
  <string id="6166194">Clever. He stopped Emeric from investigating by getting Meredith on his side.</string>
  <string id="6166197">Sounds like Gascard was trying to locate a particular mage in Starkhaven.</string>
  <string id="6166198">What does Starkhaven's Circle have to do with this?</string>
  <string id="6166199">Why would Gascard be inquiring about escaped mages from Starkhaven?</string>
  <string id="6166200">Where's Starkhaven?</string>
  <string id="6166201">Maybe Gascard was looking for help from another mage.</string>
  <string id="6166202">Pfeh. Mages.</string>
  <string id="6166205">Looks like Gascard's been busy.</string>
  <string id="6166206">What creatures are they talking about? The shades?</string>
  <string id="6166207">Gascard went to a great deal of trouble for something.</string>
  <string id="6166208">Gascard likes ancient artifacts, just like me!</string>
  <string id="6166209">Shipment? What shipment is he talking about? Magical items? Body parts maybe?</string>
  <string id="6166210">Gascard is planning something. That much is clear.</string>
  <string id="6166211">This is a dangerous place to be a bad thief, Sparky.</string>
  <string id="6166214">I knew a guy once who could take every coin out of your pockets just by smiling at you.</string>
  <string id="6166217">But you? You don't have the style to work Hightown, let alone the Merchants Guild.</string>
  <string id="6166220">Sighs Give it here.</string>
  <string id="6166226">Might want to find yourself a new line of work.</string>
  <string id="6166232">No. Do not stop now.</string>
  <string id="6166235">Win here, and you will be on open water by tomorrow's eve.</string>
  <string id="6166238">Sighs Don't stand in my way, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6166239">Triumph here as you failed against the darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6166251">Like everyone's holding their breath until you leave.</string>
  <string id="6166270">This grudge you have against mages seems very... personal.</string>
  <string id="6166271">Why do you hate mages so much?</string>
  <string id="6166272">It is personal.</string>
  <string id="6166275">I imagine you think I won't answer that, but allow me to surprise you.</string>
  <string id="6166278">My sister was a mage. She was a kind, gentle soul... and completely unprepared for such a burden.</string>
  <string id="6166281">My family hid her. We knew she could never last in the Circle or pass their rigorous tests.</string>
  <string id="6166282">You broke the laws you tell everyone to abide by now?</string>
  <string id="6166283">So you're a hypocrite.</string>
  <string id="6166284">I did, yes.</string>
  <string id="6166287">She was your family. What else could you do?</string>
  <string id="6166288">You were protecting her.</string>
  <string id="6166289">Let me guess: it didn't go like you'd hoped?</string>
  <string id="6166290">I see where this is going.</string>
  <string id="6166291">Amelia was terrified, and utterly grateful for our efforts. We thought we were doing the right thing.</string>
  <string id="6166294">And then she was possessed by a demon.</string>
  <string id="6166297">My sister killed our family, and I only barely escaped. Before the templars brought her down, she'd slain seventy innocents.</string>
  <string id="6166300">So I understand perfectly well why the mages struggle... as well as why the laws we uphold are so vital.</string>
  <string id="6166301">What killed those people was an abomination. It wasn't a mage.</string>
  <string id="6166302">That wasn't your sister.</string>
  <string id="6166303">And should we wait for an abomination to manifest before we act? We cannot.</string>
  <string id="6166306">So you've turned this into a crusade to make up for what you did?</string>
  <string id="6166307">You feel guilty.</string>
  <string id="6166308">That must have been horrible.</string>
  <string id="6166309">I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6166310">It gave me a reason to join the templars, and a worthy cause.</string>
  <string id="6166313">I will not allow my sister's death to be without purpose. It will serve as a reminder of where good intentions can lead.</string>
  <string id="6166316">I have sympathy for mages. They suffer a terrible curse... but it is one that carries a price they must not deny.</string>
  <string id="6166317">I still don't see what you want from me.</string>
  <string id="6166318">Why am I here?</string>
  <string id="6166320">I should be home by now... I really should be.</string>
  <string id="6166333">Are you Dalish? I see you around here with your human friends.</string>
  <string id="6166334">You don't belong here.</string>
  <string id="6166338">I wish you humans would just leave us alone.</string>
  <string id="6166345">I heard strange things coming from your house again last week.</string>
  <string id="6166348">Oh? What sort of things?</string>
  <string id="6166349">You're the Champion, aren't you?</string>
  <string id="6166356">Slumming it today, are we, human?</string>
  <string id="6166360">A human doesn't last long here at night.</string>
  <string id="6166361">I wonder if the Blooming Rose is hiring.</string>
  <string id="6166362">Maybe the old tailor needs some help now that his other eye fell out. </string>
  <string id="6166363">Looks like rain today.</string>
  <string id="6166367">There's no definition of all right that fits this state.</string>
  <string id="6166372">I'll make sure that order gets placed for you right away, messere.</string>
  <string id="6166373">I'll see that gets crafted before you know it.</string>
  <string id="6166374">I'll make sure that gets done right now.</string>
  <string id="6166375">Another order? I'll see to it, messere.</string>
  <string id="6166376">Let's get that order to the crafters right away, shall we?</string>
  <string id="6166380">I suppose you want me to drop off that order for you?</string>
  <string id="6166381">What is it this time? Something to blow up my house?</string>
  <string id="6166382">I'll bring that to the crafters on my way to the tavern.</string>
  <string id="6166383">You just never run out of stuff to buy, do you?</string>
  <string id="6166384">Wait a minute... let me see this ship.</string>
  <string id="6166385">No. Wesley wouldn't ask me to turn against a friend.</string>
  <string id="6166390">Stop looking at me. I-I really don't like all this... open... slobbery... affection.</string>
  <string id="6166393">Happy bark!</string>
  <string id="6166394">I nearly killed an innocent girl. How could I be all right?</string>
  <string id="6166395">For an extra fee, I'll be Nalia the Nookie Spirit. Straight from the Fade and ready to party!</string>
  <string id="6166398">S'like dipping your wick in liquid lyrium.</string>
  <string id="6166403">I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6166406">You're sorry? For me? This could be you! You could be the next monster threatening helpless girls!</string>
  <string id="6166409">Anders... There's no such thing as a good spirit. There never was.</string>
  <string id="6166412">All spirits are dangerous. I understood that. I'm sorry that you didn't.</string>
  <string id="6166418">Yes... I can make this right.</string>
  <string id="6166421">Be a real pet! Ignore me until you want something and then sit on my head!</string>
  <string id="6166424">Whines</string>
  <string id="6166427">I miss Ser Pounce-a-lot.</string>
  <string id="6166430">Happy bark!</string>
  <string id="6166433">I cannot join you in this. The Fade is no place for men of faith.</string>
  <string id="6166440">I thought your people didn't like humans.</string>
  <string id="6166443">I'm not Dalish. I still don't like most humans, however.</string>
  <string id="6166449">Who said that? I'm Dalish, and I like humans.</string>
  <string id="6166452">You do?</string>
  <string id="6166455">It's very lively! Like a crow in the middle of anting!</string>
  <string id="6166458">That's... that's great. Thanks, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6166461">I tried to warn you, Blondie.</string>
  <string id="6166462">I wouldn't have called them lively. Bedraggled, maybe. Or just... fluffy.</string>
  <string id="6166477">And Andraste did say, Those who harm a house of the Maker, have done harm unto the Maker himself.</string>
  <string id="6166480">Grumbles</string>
  <string id="6166483">Huffs</string>
  <string id="6166486">Yelps</string>
  <string id="6166491">Just... strange is all. I like you, Merrill. I wouldn't want the templars down here any time soon.</string>
  <string id="6166494">Terrie</string>
  <string id="6166500">You're not helping.</string>
  <string id="6166513">I haven't seen you around here before. I would've remembered such a pretty face.</string>
  <string id="6166522">I'm... I'm not pretty.</string>
  <string id="6166525">Of course you are. Anyone who can't see it is a fool.</string>
  <string id="6166530">Leave me alone. I'm not doing anything wrong.</string>
  <string id="6166537">We don't want any trouble, messere.</string>
  <string id="6166540">Neither do I, serah.</string>
  <string id="6166543">I... uh... good. Good.</string>
  <string id="6166544">Huh. The Champion. What brings you to Lowtown?</string>
  <string id="6166551">I wonder if the guard noticed that body in the alley yet.</string>
  <string id="6166555">Watch yourself here, shem. One dead human brings fifty guards in the morning.</string>
  <string id="6166556">If one more human calls me knife ears, I swear...</string>
  <string id="6166557">These pants are chaffing me.</string>
  <string id="6166558">I wonder if the shems have this hard of a time finding a job.</string>
  <string id="6166562">Hawke! Long time no see, my friend!</string>
  <string id="6166565">Worthy. Not nearly long enough, I think.</string>
  <string id="6166568">Laughs Still have that chip on your shoulder, I see.</string>
  <string id="6166571">Worthy? When did you get back into town?</string>
  <string id="6166574">Oh, just a month or so ago. Things didn't work out in Orzammar.</string>
  <string id="6166577">When? I've been back for years! Watched you run through here on many occasions, in fact.</string>
  <string id="6166580">Well, if it isn't Worthy, the dwarf with the incredibly ironic name.</string>
  <string id="6166583">Laughs I only advertise the truth!</string>
  <string id="6166589">You aren't still working for Athenril, are you? Your year must be up by now.</string>
  <string id="6166590">You still with the Red Iron? It was just a year you were with them, right?</string>
  <string id="6166591">I'm looking to become an explorer, of a sort.</string>
  <string id="6166592">I'm funding an expedition.</string>
  <string id="6166593">I heard! Bartrand's hard to take, but his information is usually good.</string>
  <string id="6166596">Hard to take? That's putting it mildly.</string>
  <string id="6166599">Last time we spoke you were still working for Athenril. All done with smuggling, now?</string>
  <string id="6166600">Last time we spoke you were still with the Red Iron. All done with the mercenary business, now?</string>
  <string id="6166601">Maybe you didn't hear? I routed the Qunari out of Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6166602">I'm the Champion.</string>
  <string id="6166603">Heh. Yes, I did hear that—but who knows what you have going on the side?</string>
  <string id="6166606">Yes, I'm done with that.</string>
  <string id="6166607">I'm on my own.</string>
  <string id="6166608">Good for you! Always nice to see someone striking out on their own.</string>
  <string id="6166611">I'm always open to a new job if it's interesting.</string>
  <string id="6166612">I'm open to work.</string>
  <string id="6166613">Laughs A job? Yes, I could use one of those myself.</string>
  <string id="6166616">Still trying to ferret out everyone's business, I see.</string>
  <string id="6166617">Nosy, aren't you?</string>
  <string id="6166618">Of course! How else do you expect a dwarf to make a living?</string>
  <string id="6166621">Tell you what: I still have my old contacts. You need some runecrafting done, I can arrange it for you.</string>
  <string id="6166627">Take care, Hawke. Don't get dead.</string>
  <string id="6166633">Let's see if I can't get that runecrafting arranged.</string>
  <string id="6166634">Always a pleasure doing business with a friend.</string>
  <string id="6166635">Very well! I'll have that order brought to my contacts right away!</string>
  <string id="6166636">More work, is it? I know a few dwarves who'll be very happy.</string>
  <string id="6166637">Let's see if I can't get you those quick as you please.</string>
  <string id="6166644">Always a pleasure, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6166648">Heard your jaunt into the Deep Roads went rather well. Good for you!</string>
  <string id="6166652">Hello again, Hawke... or should I call you the Champion?</string>
  <string id="6166671">What are we talking about?</string>
  <string id="6166674">Believing. You do, I can tell. In freedom. In mages. In good spirits. In bad templars. With more fire than the sun.</string>
  <string id="6166677">And your point is?</string>
  <string id="6166680">Be careful what you believe in. A lot of things burn in that fire.</string>
  <string id="6166681">I used to believe in things, too. Now... I think maybe it's better just to believe in people.</string>
  <string id="6166682">I miss it, sometimes. Things being certain.</string>
  <string id="6166687">You were the one who killed Huon, weren't you?</string>
  <string id="6166688">I lost my brother to that bastard, Huon.</string>
  <string id="6166699">Good. They should've done it years ago when they first found out he was a robe.</string>
  <string id="6166700">Trusted</string>
  <string id="6166701">Trusted</string>
  <string id="6166702">Crisis</string>
  <string id="6166703">Crisis</string>
  <string id="6166711">People make mistakes.</string>
  <string id="6166714">That's why they need you to believe in them. If they never made mistakes, it wouldn't matter if you believed.</string>
  <string id="6166717">Burning isn't necessarily bad. Fire can cleanse.</string>
  <string id="6166720">Some things are certain.</string>
  <string id="6166721">Some people just aren't built for family life. At least Feynriel has a mother who cares about him.</string>
  <string id="6166726">I don't think people are cleansed by fire.</string>
  <string id="6166729">Not anymore.</string>
  <string id="6166747">I doubt many bother you in that get up.</string>
  <string id="6166754">I'm not doing anything.</string>
  <string id="6166757">Never said you were.</string>
  <string id="6166758">Hello, mark... er, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6166765">What are you looking at?</string>
  <string id="6166769">Keep your eyes to yourself.</string>
  <string id="6166770">I wonder if I should lance this before it gets any bigger.</string>
  <string id="6166772">If I joined the Chantry, would I get fed three times a day, I wonder?</string>
  <string id="6166776">What were the hunters doing in here?</string>
  <string id="6166779">The Keeper would have sent them to recover elven artifacts from the Varterral before the camp had to move again.</string>
  <string id="6166782">So your Keeper sent them to their deaths?</string>
  <string id="6166785">No, normally they let the Dalish come and go as we please.</string>
  <string id="6166794">Something must have provoked it!</string>
  <string id="6166801">You know, you play diamondback better than my cousin Vidar.</string>
  <string id="6166807">You wag your tail whenever you have a good hand, though. Might want to watch that.</string>
  <string id="6166810">Barks</string>
  <string id="6166811">It's a short tail. I'm sure nobody notices.</string>
  <string id="6166812">He'll do fine.</string>
  <string id="6166813">Is it brilliant or horrible that you play diamondback with my dog?</string>
  <string id="6166814">You taught my dog to gamble.</string>
  <string id="6166815">He doesn't take well to having his flaws pointed out.</string>
  <string id="6166816">Don't make him mad.</string>
  <string id="6166817">All I'm saying is, he'd be up more than two sovereigns if he watched his tells.</string>
  <string id="6166820">My Uncle Emmet has a whole pack of rat terriers who play every week.</string>
  <string id="6166823">Growls</string>
  <string id="6166826">Now don't take it bad—you're still better than Anders.</string>
  <string id="6166829">I hope we'd be kind to any child, but you never know with these scoundrels.</string>
  <string id="6166835">Happy bark!</string>
  <string id="6166838">Coming to the Hanged Man later?</string>
  <string id="6166844">Hold on, Pol! We're coming!</string>
  <string id="6166847">Maybe there's something we can use against it...</string>
  <string id="6166850">That! That might do!</string>
  <string id="6166854">Grab that! Over there!</string>
  <string id="6166860">Maybe that will help?</string>
  <string id="6166866">Uh, Hawke? I think taking its toys is just making it mad.</string>
  <string id="6166867">I'm starting to think that stealing its treasure is a bad idea.</string>
  <string id="6166868">All right, taking the treasures just makes it mad.</string>
  <string id="6166872">I'm afraid to say it, but there's another item we could try over there...</string>
  <string id="6166875">This just gets better and better.</string>
  <string id="6166880">Right. I'll... just be off then.</string>
  <string id="6166884">My, my. If it isn't Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6166887">Elegant.</string>
  <string id="6166890">Good to see you again, Elegant.</string>
  <string id="6166893">Still up to old tricks, Elegant?</string>
  <string id="6166896">Lady Elegant, if you don't mind. I'm a married woman now.</string>
  <string id="6166899">Last time we met, you were still in Athenril's employ. Things have been going well since then?</string>
  <string id="6166900">Last time we met, you were still working for that brutish thug, Meeran. Things have been going well since then?</string>
  <string id="6166901">Is there something you're interested in?</string>
  <string id="6166902">Why do you want to know?</string>
  <string id="6166903">It isn't always easy, but things are going well enough.</string>
  <string id="6166904">I'm doing my best.</string>
  <string id="6166905">Especially since you became the Champion, yes?</string>
  <string id="6166908">That's wonderful to hear.</string>
  <string id="6166911">Could be better. Could be worse!</string>
  <string id="6166912">No complaints.</string>
  <string id="6166913">I often feel the same way.</string>
  <string id="6166916">You may recall I sometimes provided potions for Athenril. I'd be willing to extend you the same courtesy if you like.</string>
  <string id="6166919">You may recall I supplied the Red Iron with potions. I'd be willing to extend you the same courtesy if you like.</string>
  <string id="6166922">All I ask is you inform me of any interesting reagents you find. In exchange, I'll approach my contacts on your behalf.</string>
  <string id="6166925">And of course you'll need the appropriate recipes... such as this one. Free, for old time's sake.</string>
  <string id="6166931">I'll get a hold of my alchemist contacts presently.</string>
  <string id="6166932">You won't be disappointed, I assure you.</string>
  <string id="6166933">I'm certain my contacts can provide what you need.</string>
  <string id="6166934">Always a pleasure doing business, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6166935">I'm certain these potions will be exactly what you need.</string>
  <string id="6166942">You should meet my husband, Hawke. Perhaps an evening out sometime?</string>
  <string id="6166946">I'm told your expedition did quite well for you. Bravo!</string>
  <string id="6166950">Always a pleasure to meet the Champion of Kirkwall. If you need anything at all, let me know.</string>
  <string id="6166954">Why is this thing still here? Didn't I kill it once already?</string>
  <string id="6166957">It was bound here. As long as it has something to guard, duty will force it to stay alive.</string>
  <string id="6166963">Why do you say that?</string>
  <string id="6166966">You came all the way from Lothering with them, didn't you? And they're not even your clan!</string>
  <string id="6166969">Humans don't have clans, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6166972">Exactly! You came so far together, and you didn't even have a Keeper to make you get along.</string>
  <string id="6166975">So your Keeper tells you to stop kicking each other, or she'll turn the aravel around?</string>
  <string id="6166978">Sometimes she also warns us to stop pulling hair.</string>
  <string id="6166979">Captured Apostate</string>
  <string id="6166983">A poor start, Hawke. Is this all you are?</string>
  <string id="6166984">Yes! Show me everything you can do.</string>
  <string id="6166985">Doubt hobbles you. Like all before the Qun.</string>
  <string id="6166986">Know this: even now, you serve.</string>
  <string id="6166987">Your role is not accepted—it is realized.</string>
  <string id="6166988">Even if you win, you still serve Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6166989">Dead or alive, the Qun knows your worth.</string>
  <string id="6166990">This is not battle—it is preparation.</string>
  <string id="6166991">You are the best, so you are the example.</string>
  <string id="6166992">Fight, and give us the tools to defeat you.</string>
  <string id="6166993">You are what we will expect when we return.</string>
  <string id="6166994">Struggle is an illusion. Everything submits to the Qun!</string>
  <string id="6166997">The best of us, humans! These are Qunari!</string>
  <string id="6166998">Sten hass-toh! Bas nehersaam sataa shok!</string>
  <string id="6166999">Katasaam shok! Ver-toh ebra tadim!</string>
  <string id="6167000">Shanedan kata ebratoh! Meravas!</string>
  <string id="6167001">Meravas! Koshok asit lok!</string>
  <string id="6167002">Var-toh katashok, ebadim maraas issala toh!</string>
  <string id="6167006">They probably could teach him. Whether they would is another matter entirely.</string>
  <string id="6167007">Pure Ironbark</string>
  <string id="6167009">Harlot's Blush Flower</string>
  <string id="6167013">Did you ever run the Wilds, boy? Kirkwall is no city for a breed used to open spaces.</string>
  <string id="6167016">Barks</string>
  <string id="6167019">Nice as your estate is, it's not healthy for a mabari to be cooped up.</string>
  <string id="6167022">May I take him to the barracks, time to time? He could help train my guards.</string>
  <string id="6167023">I'm sure he'll enjoy that. Thanks for the offer.</string>
  <string id="6167024">That's a great idea.</string>
  <string id="6167025">Good idea. He'll put the fear of dog into them.</string>
  <string id="6167026">He could use the exercise.</string>
  <string id="6167027">He's here keep the place safe. I need him to stay.</string>
  <string id="6167028">I want him here.</string>
  <string id="6167029">Your decision, but a fat hound won't do you much good.</string>
  <string id="6167032">Whines</string>
  <string id="6167037">It wasn't a big enough village to have a wall around it, let alone a place for elves.</string>
  <string id="6167040">Where did the elves live, then?</string>
  <string id="6167043">Stables and outbuildings, mostly.</string>
  <string id="6167046">I think I like alienages better.</string>
  <string id="6167047">Jake the Black</string>
  <string id="6167049">Chest</string>
  <string id="6167053">From what I've seen, the Qunari don't like anything.</string>
  <string id="6167056">That can't be true. They must like some things... sunshine? Butterflies? Rainbows?</string>
  <string id="6167057">Innley of Starkhaven</string>
  <string id="6167061">Heborah de Soliere</string>
  <string id="6167065">If I spot a Qunari admiring butterflies, Merrill, you'll be the first person I tell.</string>
  <string id="6167066">Good. I think it's time they faced down a good old mabari charge.</string>
  <string id="6167069">How about it, boy? Want to chew on some recruits?</string>
  <string id="6167072">Barks!</string>
  <string id="6167083">A fascinating breed. Such intelligence and strength.</string>
  <string id="6167087">I'm not always sure I want to know.</string>
  <string id="6167088">Sometimes.</string>
  <string id="6167089">He still thinks about dog things. Just with more clarity.</string>
  <string id="6167090">Important dog issues.</string>
  <string id="6167091">Slaying his enemies, just like he's been bred to do.</string>
  <string id="6167092">Killing things.</string>
  <string id="6167109">Mostly it stands in my house, looking a bit spooky.</string>
  <string id="6167112">But it's magic, right? So it can do... magic things? Is it dangerous?</string>
  <string id="6167115">It could fall on someone, but you'd have to push really hard. It's quite heavy.</string>
  <string id="6167118">Merrill, is it a danger to the people of Kirkwall or not?</string>
  <string id="6167121">Oh! Only to anyone sitting right under it.</string>
  <string id="6167140">Hawke!</string>
  <string id="6167143">Frolic through dreams? Sounds like an experience. I'm game.</string>
  <string id="6167150">Aveline, you'll look after Hawke, won't you?</string>
  <string id="6167157">Here boy. I've something to whet your teeth on.</string>
  <string id="6167160">Whines</string>
  <string id="6167163">Freshly confiscated mutton, just for you. Have at it!</string>
  <string id="6167166">Happy bark!</string>
  <string id="6167169">Oh, hello. Just on a routine patrol. I'll be going now.</string>
  <string id="6167172">The Champion of Kirkwall doesn't really need my protection, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6167175">Of course I will. What kind of a question is that?</string>
  <string id="6167178">Just checking on my best guardsman. He's helping the men to learn healthy respect. And how to run.</string>
  <string id="6167187">And sometimes Isabela gets into awful trouble. You'll watch out for her, too?</string>
  <string id="6167190">What about Varric? And Anders? You'll watch out for them, too?</string>
  <string id="6167193">Merrill... what brought this on?</string>
  <string id="6167196">Anything could happen. You'll protect them, though. It's what you do.</string>
  <string id="6167199">There's nothing to worry about, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6167208">We dwarves are drawn to shiny objects. Sort of like magpies, but with business sense.</string>
  <string id="6167209">Good choice.</string>
  <string id="6167212">You left out criminals and hired muscle.</string>
  <string id="6167215">They don't count.</string>
  <string id="6167220">You're kidding.</string>
  <string id="6167223">Of course I am. We come to the surface with the skills our ancestors had, Blondie.</string>
  <string id="6167226">You think there's a tradition of dwarf woodcutters in Orzammar? Bee keepers? Sailors? </string>
  <string id="6167229">Well, there could be mushroom growers and nug wranglers.</string>
  <string id="6167232">Orzammar will never let those people go topside. Too vital. Also, embarrassing.</string>
  <string id="6167236">Fine. There, you got a pat. Now will you leave me be?</string>
  <string id="6167239">Barks</string>
  <string id="6167242">Try to sniff my crotch, and I swear I'll stab you. Shoo!</string>
  <string id="6167243">Don't mind him. He's just showing off to try to win you over.</string>
  <string id="6167244">He's just being friendly.</string>
  <string id="6167245">Strange, I figured you for a dog lover.</string>
  <string id="6167246">You don't like dogs?</string>
  <string id="6167247">I don't dislike dogs. I just don't like having my leg humped... at least not without dinner and a drink.</string>
  <string id="6167250">Come on, leave her be. She's too dainty for a killer like you.</string>
  <string id="6167251">Down, boy!</string>
  <string id="6167252">Whines</string>
  <string id="6167255">And now I've forgotten what I came here for. Blast.</string>
  <string id="6167264">Tomwise?</string>
  <string id="6167267">Huh? Oh... Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6167270">Haven't seen you since we did that job together for Athenril. Been a while.</string>
  <string id="6167273">Haven't seen you since Meeran hired me for that Red Iron job. Been a while.</string>
  <string id="6167276">I gotta say, when I heard you were the Champion of Kirkwall, I was kind of surprised.</string>
  <string id="6167277">I fought the Qunari and won, didn't I?</string>
  <string id="6167278">Why surprised?</string>
  <string id="6167279">Chuckles I just didn't figure you for the Champion sort, that's all.</string>
  <string id="6167282">I was just protecting my home.</string>
  <string id="6167283">I didn't ask for a title.</string>
  <string id="6167284">Well, good on you. That's all I have to say.</string>
  <string id="6167287">You're surprised? I was actually there when it happened.</string>
  <string id="6167288">Me too.</string>
  <string id="6167289">Laughs I can just imagine.</string>
  <string id="6167292">I heard you've gotten yourself involved with the oxmen. Nasty lot, them Qunari. Sure that's wise?</string>
  <string id="6167293">If nobody deals with them, things will get much worse.</string>
  <string id="6167294">Somebody has to help.</string>
  <string id="6167295">Huh. I bet they'll get worse anyhow.</string>
  <string id="6167298">Heard you're going on some expedition into the Deep Roads, and right into darkspawn territory. Sure that's wise?</string>
  <string id="6167300">I can handle myself.</string>
  <string id="6167301">I've fought darkspawn before.</string>
  <string id="6167304">I've nothing to fear from the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6167307">It's a risk, but if we succeed, it'll be worth it.</string>
  <string id="6167308">I'm sure.</string>
  <string id="6167309">We can't all make a living in the Undercity.</string>
  <string id="6167310">It's a living.</string>
  <string id="6167311">Just watch your back, that's all I'm saying.</string>
  <string id="6167314">Say... you still in the market for some poisons? Athenril's scarce these days, and the Coterie have their own mixers.</string>
  <string id="6167317">Say... you still in the market for some poisons? The Red Iron's been scarce, and business has been a little slow.</string>
  <string id="6167320">You find any rare reagents and want me to whip you up something, just let me know.</string>
  <string id="6167323">In fact, since you're an old friend, here's a recipe. My speciality.</string>
  <string id="6167326">Everyone needs an edge sometimes, right?</string>
  <string id="6167332">Nice. I could use a few coins.</string>
  <string id="6167333">You need something whipped up special, I'm your elf.</string>
  <string id="6167334">Just don't get them mixed up with your potions. Trust me.</string>
  <string id="6167335">Looks like I'll have a bit more work? Good to know.</string>
  <string id="6167336">Just don't drink any of this shit by accident. I don't do antidotes.</string>
  <string id="6167343">Still living with that uncle of yours in Lowtown? Nobody's stabbed him yet, huh?</string>
  <string id="6167347">Hear you got a nice little setup in Hightown? Sounds pretty sweet.</string>
  <string id="6167351">Watch your back around those templars. Word is they're gunning for you, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6167352">Charity to a point, I see.</string>
  <string id="6167356">That's the best you can do with a guard staring you in the face?</string>
  <string id="6167359">Oh sure, like he's family.</string>
  <string id="6167362">To a point, serah.</string>
  <string id="6167371">Exceptions can be made...</string>
  <string id="6167374">Really? This one gets to walk away?</string>
  <string id="6167398">Doesn't seem necessary.</string>
  <string id="6167404">Cruel and petty.</string>
  <string id="6167407">Then let the city guard do what we're good at. I can track the boy.</string>
  <string id="6167434">Risky, but who else is there? We need this.</string>
  <string id="6167437">Ever deeper, is that it?</string>
  <string id="6167440">Better than dealing with another snake.</string>
  <string id="6167443">Can you trust anything down here?</string>
  <string id="6167446">Angelique</string>
  <string id="6167451">Sure, it could. You could suddenly realize you're completely naked, or something. Chuckles</string>
  <string id="6167457">Who cares? It's shiny!</string>
  <string id="6167460">There's going to be a catch.</string>
  <string id="6167463">Aha! You see? I knew there'd be a catch!</string>
  <string id="6167472">Some people never learn.</string>
  <string id="6167473">I'm getting tired of teaching these people.</string>
  <string id="6167474">They want to keep dying, I'm good with that.</string>
  <string id="6167475">Keep it up. I like the company.</string>
  <string id="6167476">Well, that was worth coming back for.</string>
  <string id="6167480">Pointless death after pointless death.</string>
  <string id="6167481">It's their life to throw away, I guess.</string>
  <string id="6167482">Could have walked away. It was that simple.</string>
  <string id="6167483">Where do they keep coming from?</string>
  <string id="6167484">What a mess.</string>
  <string id="6167488">Nice to know I'm not forgotten.</string>
  <string id="6167489">Hard to teach some people.</string>
  <string id="6167490">Again? Times are hard.</string>
  <string id="6167491">Persistent. I'll give them that.</string>
  <string id="6167492">People are lining up for this?</string>
  <string id="6167496">Watch out! More shades! Like in the warehouse!</string>
  <string id="6167500">There! The one who turned the others in to the templars!</string>
  <string id="6167504">There's the mage lover! For our brothers, get them!</string>
  <string id="6167508">They think they can fight slavers? Show them the truth!</string>
  <string id="6167512">That's the one who took the Amell estate! Get them!</string>
  <string id="6167516">You think blood mages forget? Never!</string>
  <string id="6167528">The magisters don't let their property go so easily!</string>
  <string id="6167532">The human! Kill them, kill them all!</string>
  <string id="6167536">That's the one! Killed our friends in Darktown! Get them!</string>
  <string id="6167540">They disgraced the captain! Show them what loyalty is!</string>
  <string id="6167544">There's the one that killed Kervell! Get them!</string>
  <string id="6167548">Raiders don't forget! Kill them!</string>
  <string id="6167552">You opened a door! We will have you!</string>
  <string id="6167560">Guilds don't like competition, Champion!</string>
  <string id="6167564">For the Keeper! You will die!</string>
  <string id="6167568">For Ianto! Kill them!</string>
  <string id="6167572">You can't go unpunished, Champion!</string>
  <string id="6167576">Kirkwall's alternate businessmen don't want no competition, Fereldan!</string>
  <string id="6167580">Here, boys! One of them Fereldan refugees who think they can take Kirkwall!</string>
  <string id="6167584">There’s a rich one! Take a head and make your fortune!</string>
  <string id="6167588">There’s the Champion! Make your name, boys!</string>
  <string id="6167589">Mage killer! Templar stooge!</string>
  <string id="6167590">They think we forget? You cross the templars, you pay!</string>
  <string id="6167591">You can't kill every slaver! We always come back!</string>
  <string id="6167592">While there's blood, there's revenge!</string>
  <string id="6167593">Any friend of the little wolf is fair game! Get them!</string>
  <string id="6167594">Darktown doesn't forget, Fereldan! </string>
  <string id="6167595">Kervell had friends everywhere! You're dead, Fereldan!</string>
  <string id="6167596">We had a good thing going! Kill them!</string>
  <string id="6167597">The Veil is weak! Take them!</string>
  <string id="6167598">You destroyed the Coterie? You ruined everything!</string>
  <string id="6167599">You think you can destroy the Coterie? Never!</string>
  <string id="6167600">This crime must be answered! For the Keeper!</string>
  <string id="6167601">Abomination! The Keeper will be avenged!</string>
  <string id="6167602">Raiders don't forget! For Ianto!</string>
  <string id="6167603">You destroyed everything, Champion! Everything!</string>
  <string id="6167607">The Qun demands the Champion be destroyed!</string>
  <string id="6167608">The death of the Arishok will not go unanswered!</string>
  <string id="6167609">One day we will save this land, but today you must die!</string>
  <string id="6167613">Not our Champion! Qunari lover!</string>
  <string id="6167614">You's no human! You're Qunari in a skin!</string>
  <string id="6167618">For the captain, you traitor!</string>
  <string id="6167619">We don't need competition making trouble!</string>
  <string id="6167620">You think you can just move in and make trouble?</string>
  <string id="6167621">We're full-up, Fereldan! You're not wanted!</string>
  <string id="6167622">We'll send you back where you came from. In a box!</string>
  <string id="6167623">This one will bleed money! Get them!</string>
  <string id="6167624">There's your chance! As rich as they come!</string>
  <string id="6167625">Take them down and you're a legend!</string>
  <string id="6167626">Kill the Champion and you're famous! Famous!</string>
  <string id="6167629">You know what the Dalish say to their dogs? Take the Dread Wolf by the ear if he comes.</string>
  <string id="6167632">Barks</string>
  <string id="6167633">Sounds interesting.</string>
  <string id="6167634">Let's hear it.</string>
  <string id="6167635">Long ago, a clan lived on the Silent Plains. It was a terrible, lonely place where the sun was forbidden to shine.</string>
  <string id="6167638">Their Keeper had a coursing hound—they had run down deer and hares and wolves together when they were young.</string>
  <string id="6167641">But they had grown old together, Keeper and hound, and now only dozed before the campfire, dreaming of hunts.</string>
  <string id="6167644">Whimpers</string>
  <string id="6167647">But then the Dread Wolf came, for the Keeper was wise and kind—the things Fen'harel hates above all else.</string>
  <string id="6167650">Fen'harel tried to shake his pursuer, but the hound ran as coursers can only run in their dreams.</string>
  <string id="6167653">Even the wind couldn't have fled that hound. He ran the Dread Wolf down and grabbed him by the tail!</string>
  <string id="6167656">Fen'harel howled, so loud that the Veil shook and even the stars scattered in fear. But the hound wouldn't let go.</string>
  <string id="6167657">You can tell my dog stories some other time.</string>
  <string id="6167658">No, thanks.</string>
  <string id="6167659">Whines</string>
  <string id="6167662">As you wish.</string>
  <string id="6167668">Neither hound nor Wolf gave in. Finally, Fen'harel bit off his own tail to escape, and away he fled.</string>
  <string id="6167671">At night, he tried to steal into the Keeper's dreams, to twist his mind and turn him against the People.</string>
  <string id="6167674">But even in dreams, the courser guarded his master. He caught the Dread Wolf's scent and gave chase across the Fade.</string>
  <string id="6167675">That's fascinating. Let's hear the rest.</string>
  <string id="6167676">Please continue.</string>
  <string id="6167677">I don't think you have a choice.</string>
  <string id="6167678">Don't keep him waiting.</string>
  <string id="6167679">Barks</string>
  <string id="6167682">Barks</string>
  <string id="6167687">Your hound is a mark of nobility in Ferelden, is he not?</string>
  <string id="6167690">Barks</string>
  <string id="6167693">I have heard that gaining a mabari's loyalty is considered the ultimate proof of character there.</string>
  <string id="6167694">That's kind of you to say. I think we make a good pair.</string>
  <string id="6167695">Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6167696">That's him: my own living, breathing, slobbering status symbol. </string>
  <string id="6167697">He's a great dog.</string>
  <string id="6167698">Am I only important once a dog says I'm a noble?</string>
  <string id="6167699">Why does it matter?</string>
  <string id="6167712">I'm pleased you liked it. So few animals are interested in Dalish history.</string>
  <string id="6167715">He’s a sweet dog, Hawke. See you later.</string>
  <string id="6167718">Can we skip ahead to the exciting parts?</string>
  <string id="6167719">How much more?</string>
  <string id="6167854">Win what?</string>
  <string id="6167857">In the end. It feels like something is ending, doesn't it? Do you think we'll win?</string>
  <string id="6167860">Nothing is ending, Merrill. Things are a little tense, but it will pass.</string>
  <string id="6167863">I wouldn't know.</string>
  <string id="6167866">I'm sure you'd be able to tell. Dalish aren't much like the elves in the cities.</string>
  <string id="6167870">Your armor is very shiny, Sebastian. Doesn't that make you an easier target?</string>
  <string id="6167871">If your city was stolen, why didn't you just call the guards?</string>
  <string id="6167872">I've always wondered: how do your Divines choose their names?</string>
  <string id="6167873">Does your bow have a name? Varric's bow has a name.</string>
  <string id="6167877">So, Choir Boy, this usurper of yours is... twenty feet tall?</string>
  <string id="6167878">Tell us about Starkhaven, Choir Boy. I'm sure we're all burning with curiosity about your far-away land.</string>
  <string id="6167879">I've heard rumors about Starkhaven, you know.</string>
  <string id="6167880">You know, Choir Boy, I wouldn't normally say this, but—the shiny white armor? It works for you.</string>
  <string id="6167887">Tevinter Chantry Amulet</string>
  <string id="6167892">Tell me where this trap should go.</string>
  <string id="6167893">One more trap. Where do you want it?</string>
  <string id="6167894">I have another trap here. We have to hurry!</string>
  <string id="6167895">Where should I set this trap?</string>
  <string id="6167896">We have to work quickly!</string>
  <string id="6167897">Are you done yet? They're almost here!</string>
  <string id="6167898">These traps will help us defend the camp.</string>
  <string id="6167899">They're coming!</string>
  <string id="6167900">Here they are!</string>
  <string id="6167901">We need to regroup. I have more traps you can set.</string>

  <string id="6167906">Chest of Clothes</string>
  <string id="6167912">The smug sense of superiority does give you away.</string>
  <string id="6167949">My people?</string>
  <string id="6167952">The elves in Tevinter. They must have heard of us.</string>
  <string id="6167955">They've heard. They just don't care.</string>
  <string id="6167958">But if they ran away, the Dalish would help them.</string>
  <string id="6167961">You might as well say, If they flew into the sky, they could live in the clouds.</string>
  <string id="6167964">What would they eat in the clouds? There's nothing there but fluff and the occasional bird.</string>
  <string id="6167979">This is why nobody takes the Dalish seriously.</string>
  <string id="6167982">No.</string>
  <string id="6167985">Slam your fingers in a door?</string>
  <string id="6167988">No.</string>
  <string id="6167991">Smack your head on a low beam?</string>
  <string id="6167994">Is there a point to this line of questioning?</string>
  <string id="6167997">Just wondering why you're so cross all the time.</string>
  <string id="6168000">I think he jabs himself with those spikes, personally.</string>
  <string id="6168024">What? Why are you looking at me like that?</string>
  <string id="6168027">You're in love!</string>
  <string id="6168030">I am not.</string>
  <string id="6168033">You keep looking at Hawke with sad puppy eyes every time his back is turned.</string>
  <string id="6168036">Every time she looks away, you stare at Hawke with those sad puppy eyes.</string>
  <string id="6168039">There are no puppy eyes.</string>
  <string id="6168042">It's all right, you know. Even you can be happy once in a while. It won't kill you.</string>
  <string id="6168045">But your face might crack if you smile, so be careful.</string>
  <string id="6168103">I told you already. I saw her!</string>
  <string id="6168106">Did you see where she went?</string>
  <string id="6168109">What do I get for telling you?</string>
  <string id="6168110">Here's a few silver. Buy yourself some food. And new shoes.</string>
  <string id="6168111">Coin.</string>
  <string id="6168112">Get lost, you little runt. I'm not giving you anything.</string>
  <string id="6168113">I'm not paying you.</string>
  <string id="6168114">Enough. This is about your mother.</string>
  <string id="6168117">You want something? Here. What about this?</string>
  <string id="6168120">Gasps That's real silver, that is! I'm your man, through and through. Tell you everything I know!</string>
  <string id="6168123">Maybe you should talk to my fist.</string>
  <string id="6168124">Don't make me angry.</string>
  <string id="6168125">Why? Does it talk back?</string>
  <string id="6168128">You don't get your ears boxed.</string>
  <string id="6168129">I don't get angry.</string>
  <string id="6168130">All right, all right! I'll tell you!</string>
  <string id="6168133">That lady was here. She looked like she was going to take the bridge to Hightown.</string>
  <string id="6168136">But then a man came up to her. He stumbled and fell over, right at her feet, like he was dead.</string>
  <string id="6168139">His hands were all bloody, like he'd been in a fight. The lady shook him, and I think he said, Help.</string>
  <string id="6168142">She got him to his feet, and he was wobbly—it was funny. Anyway, they left, and... that's all I saw.</string>
  <string id="6168143">What did the man look like?</string>
  <string id="6168144">Can you describe the man?</string>
  <string id="6168145">He was a man. He had hair and... a nose. And nice clothes, but they were all stained from the blood.</string>
  <string id="6168148">Sighs</string>
  <string id="6168149">It's not too late. She could still be alive.</string>
  <string id="6168150">I have to find her.</string>
  <string id="6168151">Why would anyone take her? It doesn't make sense!</string>
  <string id="6168154">I never thought I'd curse my mother's kind-heartedness.</string>
  <string id="6168155">Mother always has to help.</string>
  <string id="6168156">You could be wrong about all of this. Maybe the flowers don't mean anything.</string>
  <string id="6168159">I'll destroy anyone who touches one hair on her head.</string>
  <string id="6168160">He won't get away with this.</string>
  <string id="6168161">Yes. You... you go do that. You're good at that sort of thing.</string>
  <string id="6168164">Do you have any idea who this man is, Uncle?</string>
  <string id="6168165">What do you think?</string>
  <string id="6168166">I couldn't tell you, dear girl.</string>
  <string id="6168169">I couldn't tell you, my boy.</string>
  <string id="6168172">You know Mother. She just can't resist helping people.</string>
  <string id="6168173">Mother has a good heart.</string>
  <string id="6168174">Chuckles That's Leandra, all right.</string>
  <string id="6168177">I'm going after Mother. You go back home.</string>
  <string id="6168178">I'll find her.</string>
  <string id="6168179">The man left some blood... where he fell over. You could follow it.</string>
  <string id="6168182">Why don't you do what the boy says? I'm going to go home in case Leandra shows up.</string>
  <string id="6168185">Never thought I say this, but Gamlen's right. My men can look for Leandra while we check the blood. Any lead helps.</string>

Over the years, most Starkhaven apostates have been captured. But thanks to the help of many people, I have remained free. You've done so much for the apostates—if you are moved to do more, contact Mistress Selby near the Docks. She knows of many ways you could save more lives.&#13;

  <string id="6169198">And... that metaphor got a bit away from me, didn't it?</string>
  <string id="6169201">I think it did, but it was certainly exciting!</string>
  <string id="6169204">Bhelen Supporter</string>
  <string id="6169245">I thought the refugees were keeping to Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6169246">They'll let anyone into Hightown these days.</string>
  <string id="6169250">A fine day, is it not?</string>
  <string id="6169255">Well met, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6169285">What would I want a parrot for?</string>
  <string id="6169288">What about a peg leg? Do you have one of those?</string>
  <string id="6169291">You can see that I don't, dear.</string>
  <string id="6169294">Eye patch?</string>
  <string id="6169297">I'm disappointing you terribly, aren't I? And no hook for a hand, either.</string>
  <string id="6169300">Seems that Varric's pirate stories are awfully inaccurate.</string>
  <string id="6169303">He knows, Kitten. He likes them better that way.</string>
  <string id="6169318">I don't imagine your people travel between islands much.</string>
  <string id="6169320">Later, when Hawke isn't listening. I promise.</string>
  <string id="6169323">Barks</string>
  <string id="6169326">Good luck with that.</string>
  <string id="6169332">Not really, no.</string>
  <string id="6169333">Anders was given a Tevinter Chantry amulet.</string>
  <string id="6169336">I wouldn't start waterproofing your wagons, then. I don't think Llomerryn is ready for the Dalish.</string>
  <string id="6169337">Anders might like the Tevinter Chantry amulet. Speak to him about it in his home in Darktown.</string>
  <string id="6169340">I hope it doesn't rain.</string>
  <string id="6169341">Late again? Where is she?</string>
  <string id="6169342">I should take a trip to the country.</string>
  <string id="6169344">Blade of Mercy</string>
  <string id="6169347">What do you mean? Would we upset the people there?</string>
  <string id="6169350">It's not the kind of place where one turns down a tumble. Even refuse a fortune-teller, and they'd run your lot out of town.</string>
  <string id="6169351">The Book of Shartan</string>
  <string id="6169352">Fenris might like the Blade of Mercy. Speak to him at his Hightown mansion.</string>
  <string id="6169357">Don't think I didn't see what you did!</string>
  <string id="6169360">I should kill you, you bastard!</string>
  <string id="6169363">Don't you pretend nothing happened!</string>
  <string id="6169366">I don't know what you're talking about.</string>
  <string id="6169369">Why do you always go on like that? You're mad, woman!</string>
  <string id="6169372">Oh, this again?</string>
  <string id="6169375">Don't you talk to me like I'm crazy! I'm not crazy!</string>
  <string id="6169376">That's right! I know exactly what you've been doing!</string>
  <string id="6169377">And what are you going to do about it? You going to be a big man, now?</string>
  <string id="6169405">Where are you going now? You just went out last night!</string>
  <string id="6169408">Don't you walk away! There's work to be done!</string>
  <string id="6169411">That's right! Just run off, like a scared little boy!</string>
  <string id="6169414">I have work to do! Stop bothering me!</string>
  <string id="6169417">Maker's breath, woman, the way you go on...</string>
  <string id="6169420">And I should stay here with you? Don't make me laugh.</string>
  <string id="6169423">Fine. Go, then. See if I care!</string>
  <string id="6169424">Just wait until you get back, see if I have any surprises in store for you.</string>
  <string id="6169425">Oh, that how you feel? Maybe I won't be here when you get back!</string>
  <string id="6169429">What now?</string>
  <string id="6169432">Are you still going on about that?</string>
  <string id="6169435">Gah! This again?</string>
  <string id="6169438">You want a knife in the ribs? Because I'll give it to you!</string>
  <string id="6169441">Don't talk to me like I'm some bloody whore!</string>
  <string id="6169444">Just wait until you're asleep. Then you'll see where that gets you.</string>
  <string id="6169447">Threats, now? Wonderful!</string>
  <string id="6169448">What an amazing woman you are sometimes, you know that?</string>
  <string id="6169449">Don't threaten me, love. You know I adore you.</string>
  <string id="6169453">The Light of the Maker is my armor, Merrill. I am not afraid.</string>
  <string id="6169454">The Blade of Mercy has been given to Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6169455">Fenris refused to take the Blade of Mercy.</string>
  <string id="6169458">Maybe you could ask Him to make His Light less shiny? Then you wouldn't need as much armor.</string>
  <string id="6169468">Good day to you.</string>
  <string id="6169469">My, those weapons look sharp.</string>
  <string id="6169472">Why do you think I would know?</string>
  <string id="6169475">Because you know lots of things! I wonder if they rub their heads against tree trunks like halla do.</string>
  <string id="6169478">I'd pay a sovereign to see that.</string>
  <string id="6169484">Those poor Fereldan refugees.</string>
  <string id="6169485">A Blight in Ferelden! How terrible.</string>
  <string id="6169489">I hope the Qunari never move into Hightown.</string>
  <string id="6169493">I hope they do something about those Qunari soon.</string>
  <string id="6169500">Stop right this instant!</string>
  <string id="6169503">Stop! Thief!</string>
  <string id="6169506">Stay where you are!</string>
  <string id="6169509">Hold!</string>
  <string id="6169512">Halt in the name of the guard!</string>
  <string id="6169515">Ha! You'll have to catch me, first!</string>
  <string id="6169516">How big a fool do you think I am?</string>
  <string id="6169517">Leave me alone!</string>
  <string id="6169518">Out of my way!</string>
  <string id="6169519">Bloody guardsmen!</string>
  <string id="6169524">No wonder they seem so cranky all the time.</string>
  <string id="6169525">Fenris might be interested in Shartan's tome. See him at his Hightown mansion.</string>
  <string id="6169526">Shartan's tome has been given to Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6169528">Bounty Hunter Getaway</string>
  <string id="6169532">There's been so much trouble in Kirkwall of late.</string>
  <string id="6169536">You're the captain of the guard! You have my thanks for keeping us safe, dear girl.</string>
  <string id="6169539">You're quite welcome.</string>
  <string id="6169542">So accomplished at such a young age. How splendid!</string>
  <string id="6169545">Bounty Hunter</string>
  <string id="6169549">Bounty Hunter Assassin</string>
  <string id="6169553">Bounty Hunter</string>
  <string id="6169561">Wounded Coast</string>
  <string id="6169565">Bounty Hunter Getaway</string>
  <string id="6169569">Wounded Coast</string>
  <string id="6169580">Evening.</string>
  <string id="6169583">Anything interesting going on?</string>
  <string id="6169586">Hey, you...</string>
  <string id="6169589">So, the market. Exciting.</string>
  <string id="6169595">I'm waiting for Rory to relieve me. I've been standing here for hours. I really need to take a piss.</string>
  <string id="6169598">I didn't need to know that.</string>
  <string id="6169601">Caught a pickpocket earlier. Other than that, it's been quiet.</string>
  <string id="6169604">I heard they found an elf beaten to death by the docks.</string>
  <string id="6169607">Thank the Maker I'm not stationed there.</string>
  <string id="6169610">Broke up a fight between two young upstart nobles back at the Rose.</string>
  <string id="6169613">Drunk?</string>
  <string id="6169616">You know it.</string>
  <string id="6169628">Hey, Franz.</string>
  <string id="6169631">Joric.</string>
  <string id="6169632">You off soon?</string>
  <string id="6169635">Who knows?</string>
  <string id="6169638">Drinks at the Hanged Man when you're done?</string>
  <string id="6169641">Absolutely. See you there.</string>
  <string id="6169651">Keep moving.</string>
  <string id="6169658">Evening, Captain.</string>
  <string id="6169659">Good day, Captain Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6169661">No loitering.</string>
  <string id="6169665">Good to see you, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6169666">At your service, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6169671">I need a drink.</string>
  <string id="6169672">Hums</string>
  <string id="6169676">I certainly hope so!</string>
  <string id="6169677">You think so, do you?</string>
  <string id="6169685">Market's closed. Come back in the morning.</string>
  <string id="6169686">Bounty Hunter</string>
  <string id="6169688">On behalf of Knight-Commander Meredith, the Kirkwall Templar Order offers a gold bounty for the death or capture of several notorious apostates who have escaped the Gallows. Follow the example of Serah Hawke, who valiantly apprehended many Starkhaven apostates in years past, thereby making the realm safer. The apostates are:&#13;
&#13;
Innley of Starkhaven&#13;
Deborah Keins&#13;
Jake the Black&#13;
&#13;
Proceed with caution. May the Maker watch over any faithful who undertake this holy task.</string>
  <string id="6169689">The templars are offering a reward for capturing or killing three apostates: Innley of Starkhaven, Deborah Keins, and Jake the Black. They could be anywhere by now, even outside the city.</string>
  <string id="6169690">The templars are offering a reward for capturing or killing three apostates. One was killed, and the other two are still in hiding.</string>
  <string id="6169691">The templars are offering a reward for capturing or killing three apostates. Two were killed, and only one apostate remains.</string>
  <string id="6169692">All three apostates hunted by the Kirkwall templars are dead. Return to the Hightown Chantry during the day, and speak to Chanter Taletha to receive a reward.</string>
  <string id="6169694">All three apostates were dealt with. The chanter and the templars are pleased.</string>
  <string id="6169704">Of course, it's not surprising at all that anybody would love you, but it's nice to see you both happy.</string>
  <string id="6169707">Merrill, sometimes you're so sweet I could eat you for dessert.</string>
  <string id="6169708">He's always looking at you, and then pretending he wasn't.</string>
  <string id="6169711">She looks at you all the time, and then she looks embarrassed and pretends she's busy with something else.</string>
  <string id="6169714">I can hear you, you know.</string>
  <string id="6169717">Giggles See?</string>
  <string id="6169720">Hmm. I'll have to think about that...</string>
  <string id="6169738">I might if I can persuade the right person to come away with me.</string>
  <string id="6169741">Of course I will! As soon as I get myself a ship, I'm sailing wherever the sea takes me.</string>
  <string id="6169744">I'll miss you. You'll write to me, won't you? Do pirates write letters?</string>
  <string id="6169747">Badly. Hook hands make for awful penmanship, Kitten.</string>
  <string id="6169750">I'm afraid the matter can't be handled by guards, Merrill.</string>
  <string id="6169753">Aveline could help you! She's very good at making thieves give things back. I think it's because she's so tall.</string>
  <string id="6169758">Do you ever wonder what he thinks about?</string>
  <string id="6169761">This is beyond even Aveline's power, I'm sorry to say.</string>
  <string id="6169764">Are you sure? Have you seen her hit people?</string>
  <string id="6169767">I can hear every word you're saying.</string>
  <string id="6169768">Servant</string>
  <string id="6169772">That's because you've spent too much time frolicking in the woods, Daisy. Dwarves don't frolic.</string>
  <string id="6169775">Dalish don't really frolic, either. Not in the woods, anyway.</string>
  <string id="6169778">You have sanctioned frolicking areas?</string>
  <string id="6169781">No, just not in the woods. The trees get jealous.</string>
  <string id="6169784">But you do frolic?</string>
  <string id="6169787">Of course we do! We wouldn't be elves, otherwise.</string>
  <string id="6169791">So it's a close resemblance, then.</string>
  <string id="6169794">Well, he tells stories. And you tell stories. Although none of his begin, No shit, there I was.</string>
  <string id="6169797">I'll have to give him some better stories, then.</string>
  <string id="6169800">I'll tell her you said so, Daisy.</string>
  <string id="6169803">She can't actually hear you, can she?</string>
  <string id="6169804">The Usual Suspects</string>
  <string id="6169813">Of course she can. What kind of a question is that?</string>
  <string id="6169816">Wait, are we talking about your crossbow or something else now?</string>
  <string id="6169819">I have family like a rat has fleas, Daisy.</string>
  <string id="6169822">Does that mean you have a lot of family, or that they make you itch a lot?</string>
  <string id="6169825">Both.</string>
  <string id="6169828">There's a story behind everything, Daisy.</string>
  <string id="6169831">Which story, Daisy?</string>
  <string id="6169834">The big one. With us and Hawke, the mages, the templars. Everything.</string>
  <string id="6169837">You want to know before it happens? You're not worried about spoiling the surprise?</string>
  <string id="6169840">I might not see it end.</string>
  <string id="6169843">You have to stick with us if you want to know how it turns out, Daisy.</string>
  <string id="6169844">Do you ever miss her?</string>
  <string id="6169847">Isabela? Of course I do.</string>
  <string id="6169850">You called her by her name. I've never heard you do that before.</string>
  <string id="6169853">No fun in calling her Rivaini if she's not here to be annoyed by it.</string>
  <string id="6169856">So tell me!</string>
  <string id="6169859">I can't.</string>
  <string id="6169862">Why not?</string>
  <string id="6169865">There was a girl, and I made a promise. Bianca is the only story I can never tell.</string>
  <string id="6169868">You can't say that! Now I want to know even more!</string>
  <string id="6169871">That was the idea, Daisy.</string>
  <string id="6169876">The human says, You're lucky you're so short. That hurt like mad!</string>
  <string id="6169879">You could've just stopped me, Blondie.</string>
  <string id="6169882">Why waste a perfectly good set-up?</string>
  <string id="6169885">They write all the best sacred names on slips of paper and stuff them in a miter.</string>
  <string id="6169888">Then the newly elected Divine picks a name out of the hat.</string>
  <string id="6169898">Oh, look! The things you run across sometimes.</string>
  <string id="6169899">I'll bet this was left here just for me.</string>
  <string id="6169900">I'll take that, thank you.</string>
  <string id="6169904">That might come in handy.</string>
  <string id="6169905">This could be useful.</string>
  <string id="6169906">I'll have to take a look at this later.</string>
  <string id="6169910">Hmm. A good find.</string>
  <string id="6169911">Excellent.</string>
  <string id="6169912">I'm sure I'll find a use for that.</string>
  <string id="6169915">Kirkwall? Are you sure that's wise?</string>
  <string id="6169918">Well, that wouldn't be my first choice.</string>
  <string id="6169919">There's a lot of templars in Kirkwall, Mother...</string>
  <string id="6169925">Carver!</string>
  <string id="6169930">No!</string>
  <string id="6169934">Bethany!</string>
  <string id="6169939">No!</string>
  <string id="6169952">Welcome to the Hightown Market.</string>
  <string id="6169953">Yawns</string>
  <string id="6169956">I can already tell this isn't going anywhere pleasant.</string>
  <string id="6169959">I bet that makes pickpocketing easier.</string>
  <string id="6169962">I'll try it some time and find out.</string>
  <string id="6169972">Guardsman Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6169975">I'm not brooding.</string>
  <string id="6169978">Moping, then. You seem like you're a champion at it.</string>
  <string id="6169981">I'm perfectly content at the moment.</string>
  <string id="6169984">Oh, so that's you smiling? Glad you clarified that. I'd never have known.</string>
  <string id="6169987">Such as?</string>
  <string id="6169990">Pretty much anything? I don't think renegade mage has a bright future. Or any retirement plan.</string>
  <string id="6169991">And yet he needs to hide?</string>
  <string id="6169994">Oh, perish the thought. Another delicate mage flower.</string>
  <string id="6169997">Right. Perfectly safe if he cooperates.</string>
  <string id="6170002">I was drunk. I thought the reefs around the Wounded Coast were made of candy.</string>
  <string id="6170005">Oh, come on.</string>
  <string id="6170008">And a demon told me to do it. It bet me sixty sovereigns and a bottle of port.</string>
  <string id="6170011">You're not the only one here who can bullshit, you know.</string>
  <string id="6170012">Move along.</string>
  <string id="6170013">Watch yourself. We don't want trouble here.</string>
  <string id="6170020">Good to see you, Captain.</string>
  <string id="6170024">Good evening, citizen.</string>
  <string id="6170028">Good day.</string>
  <string id="6170035">All quiet around here, Captain.</string>
  <string id="6170038">Good. Carry on.</string>
  <string id="6170039">It just keeps getting better.</string>
  <string id="6170040">Greetings, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6170044">I don't need employment.</string>
  <string id="6170047">But it wouldn't kill you to make some friends in this city. Three years, and you're practically a ghost.</string>
  <string id="6170050">I prefer it that way.</string>
  <string id="6170053">Healthy attitude there. Forget I said anything.</string>
  <string id="6170057">Nothing to see here.</string>
  <string id="6170058">Not much going on in Hightown at this hour.</string>
  <string id="6170059">Two more passes to go...</string>
  <string id="6170062">Sure. Add it to the list of things I'm accessory to.</string>
  <string id="6170065">Must we?</string>
  <string id="6170068">Practically a guarantee.</string>
  <string id="6170071">I hope Serendipity's working tonight.</string>
  <string id="6170078">Good day to you, messere.</string>
  <string id="6170079">I'm sorry, but I'm on an important errand.</string>
  <string id="6170080">Excuse me.</string>
  <string id="6170084">I'm so late. The chamberlain is going to have my hide.</string>
  <string id="6170085">I've got to get this message to the Merchants Guild by sundown.</string>
  <string id="6170086">I'm never going to get this all done in time.</string>
  <string id="6170089">Dance, of course.</string>
  <string id="6170092">Really?</string>
  <string id="6170095">I run from room to room, choreographing routines.</string>
  <string id="6170098">You're actually joking. Alert the Chantry! They need to put this on the calendar!</string>
  <string id="6170101">And you thought I was always serious.</string>
  <string id="6170103">A Ship for Isabela</string>
  <string id="6170104">A Rivaini Talisman</string>
  <string id="6170113">Not even close, no.</string>
  <string id="6170116">But he has claws for hands, right?</string>
  <string id="6170119">Fingers. Perfectly normal ones. If a little fat, perhaps.</string>
  <string id="6170122">He eats babies, though. And farts fire.</string>
  <string id="6170125">You're not serious, I hope.</string>
  <string id="6170128">You can't even pretend to be interesting, can you?</string>
  <string id="6170129">So much work to do!</string>
  <string id="6170140">Isabela accepted the model ship.</string>
  <string id="6170141">Isabela might like a ship in a bottle! Find her in Lowtown's Hanged Man pub.</string>
  <string id="6170143">Leave me alone.</string>
  <string id="6170146">My far-away land? It's inland Free Marches, not on the moon.</string>
  <string id="6170149">And here I was hoping...</string>
  <string id="6170152">It's a lot like here. But fewer dead people.</string>
  <string id="6170153">I have nothing to say to you.</string>
  <string id="6170154">The Rivaini talisman might remind Isabela of her homeland. Find her in Lowtown's Hanged Man pub.</string>
  <string id="6170163">What if she picks a name she doesn't like? Does she have to keep it?</string>
  <string id="6170166">Of course she does. How do you think we got four Divines named Hortensia?</string>
  <string id="6170168">Isabela accepted the Rivaini talisman.</string>
  <string id="6170194">I'm afraid I can't compete with our dear dwarf's... relationship to his weapon.</string>
  <string id="6170197">You could call it Philomela!</string>
  <string id="6170200">Why would I do that?</string>
  <string id="6170203">Because it reminds me of a woman in the alienage. Skinny, pointed, and always throwing things at people.</string>
  <string id="6170206">I'm good for it.</string>
  <string id="6170227">How many glib words have dribbled from your lips, all testament to your cleverness? Every one has fed me...</string>
  <string id="6170228">Hide behind your reason and your compromises, mortal! I will still destroy you!</string>
  <string id="6170231">Meaning that you'll borrow it from Hawke, probably.</string>
  <string id="6170234">So, you think you can win the coin from Isabela? Good luck with that.</string>
  <string id="6170237">Coming to the Hanged Man for Wicked Grace later?</string>
  <string id="6170240">Never miss it.</string>
  <string id="6170253">What about us?</string>
  <string id="6170256">Want to make sure I get all the details right when I tell this story.</string>
  <string id="6170259">Did he sweep you off your feet? I'm assuming he did the sweeping. He's taller than you. Awkward, otherwise.</string>
  <string id="6170262">Did you sweep her off her feet? Or was it the other way around?</string>
  <string id="6170265">A Matter of Pride</string>
  <string id="6170266">An anonymous noble will pay for the elimination of three Qunari patrols that have been traveling in the Wounded Coast, Sundermount, and the Bone Pit.</string>
  <string id="6170269">All Qunari patrols were eliminated. The anonymous noble has promised payment via letter. </string>
  <string id="6170270">Three Qunari patrols were killed on behalf of an anonymous noble.</string>
  <string id="6170271">Serah Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
Few have succeeded in curbing the ambitions of the Qunari—except you. I write to present an opportunity: In the countryside, travelers have spotted three Qunari patrols searching the Wounded Coast, Sundermount, and the Bone Pits. I would have them eliminated. When my men have confirmed their demise, I will send a generous payment. I fear secrecy is necessary, but know that you have admirer's in the viscount's court.&#13;

  <string id="6170280">I'm not telling you anything but this: There was no actual sweeping involved.</string>
  <string id="6170283">Every little bit helps, elf.</string>
  <string id="6170286">They say you eat the dead up there. And murder strangers in the street.</string>
  <string id="6170289">Why do I suspect that when you say you've heard rumors, you mean you've invented some?</string>

Every one of those Qunari patrols has fallen by your hand. I only regret that word of your deeds cannot be called out on every street corner. Enclosed is a token of my regard. Always keep a wary eye aimed at the Qunari—I fear this business has only just begun.&#13;

  <string id="6170308">Somehow I doubt it.</string>
  <string id="6170313">Are you sure you want to encourage me? I might be about to confess my undying love.</string>
  <string id="6170316">I get that a lot. So what's on your mind?</string>
  <string id="6170319">I just realized it's been a while since any of the gangs in the Undercity came to my door.</string>
  <string id="6170322">They're busy people. Places to go, throats to cut. Maybe you've slipped their minds.</string>
  <string id="6170325">Right. The apostate running the free clinic in the sewers. Easy to forget. You didn't have anything to do with this?</string>
  <string id="6170328">You must have me confused with someone else! I'm just a businessman and a storyteller.</string>
  <string id="6170332">Traitor! May the Dread Wolf hunt you for the rest of your days!</string>
  <string id="6170336">I was trying to rebuild my life! Why did you have to come back and destroy it?</string>
  <string id="6170340">We're cursed. The whole clan. And you brought this upon us.</string>
  <string id="6170344">You couldn't let go of the past, could you? Now look at what you've done!</string>
  <string id="6170348">Curiosity... is a dangerous thing, Merrill. It will never let you rest. Never.</string>
  <string id="6170352">What have you done? What have you brought upon our clan, you monster?</string>
  <string id="6170356">Da'len, turn back. Everything you touch turns to ash.</string>
  <string id="6170360">You are a wound poisoning this clan!</string>

  <string id="6170382">You feeling all right, Blondie? You're always in the mood for templar jokes.</string>
  <string id="6170385">My face is the least of my concerns right now.</string>
  <string id="6170388">That's because you don't have to look at it.</string>

  <string id="6170415">Your eyes are like bumblebees, flying into the window of my soul. Laughs</string>
  <string id="6170418">My favorite was, Your lips are like the wings of sparrows. Red ones. With no feathers.</string>
  <string id="6170421">Oh, speak! And send the plucked wings of your lips soaring!</string>
  <string id="6170424">That's uncharacteristically kind of you, Varric.</string>
  <string id="6170427">Makes you look like a lacquered pilot whale.</string>
  <string id="6170430">Ah, now that was much more in-character.</string>
  <string id="6170431">The shield may be of some interest for Aveline, as it is attributed to her namesake. Give it to her back at the barracks.</string>
  <string id="6170432">Silly dog.</string>
  <string id="6170437">I'd buy the guy a drink, but I don't think he needs one.</string>
  <string id="6170440">Qunari</string>
  <string id="6170442">Right. That was not normal.</string>
  <string id="6170448">Should you encourage her?</string>
  <string id="6170459">Qunari</string>
  <string id="6170463">I think they're darling together.</string>
  <string id="6170466">Really? You're not at all jealous? Because I thought that you and Hawke...</string>
  <string id="6170469">Hawke was just a dalliance. You know I've still got my eye on you.</string>
  <string id="6170472">Keep dreaming, Rivaini.</string>
  <string id="6170473">It's almost too adorable. Well, except for the evil blood magic thing.</string>
  <string id="6170476">The most evil thing Merrill does most days is pick the flowers out of other people's gardens.</string>
  <string id="6170479">I know. I have to bribe most of the gardeners in Hightown to keep it quiet.</string>
  <string id="6170482">Which box? I've opened so many...</string>
  <string id="6170485">Well, those too. But later. Right now: that Qunari relic.</string>
  <string id="6170488">I'll make you a deal: I'll tell you what was in that box if you tell me how Bianca got her name.</string>
  <string id="6170491">Fine, forget I asked. Evil woman.</string>
  <string id="6170492">He would not!</string>
  <string id="6170498">You made it back to the alienage in one piece, then?</string>
  <string id="6170501">I don't know how I wound up in Darktown. There are just too many corners in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6170504">Still got that ball of twine?</string>
  <string id="6170507">I left it at my house. Don't worry! I won't get lost while we're following Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6170510">Bring it next time, Daisy. Just in case.</string>

  <string id="6170557">Me? My family's not native either. I'm just surprised. Lots of old prejudice in the guard.</string>
  <string id="6170560">I'll give them plenty of reason to change their minds.</string>
  <string id="6170563">You know, it's possible they're just scared shitless of you. That's my theory, anyway.</string>
  <string id="6170566">You know I'm a guard, why are you asking?</string>
  <string id="6170569">I mean in your off-duty hours. For fun. You've heard of it, I hope?</string>

I could perform several potent enchantments with the right ingredients and specialized tomes. Provide these ingredients, and I will compensate you handsomely. &#13;
&#13;
I need:&#13;
- Patterns Within Form, unedited version. The Chantry's version butchered Enchanter Halden's lessons.&#13;
- The Midnight Compendium or any chapter or section you can find.&#13;
- Essence of Shade. Admittedly hard to gather, as most shades dissipate when destroyed.&#13;
- An enchanted golden crucible.&#13;

  <string id="6170600">Marcia Arthurius needs a variety of ingredients to craft better magical wares: Patterns Within Forms (original version), the Midnight Compendium, the essence of shade, and an enchanted golden crucible.</string>
  <string id="6170601">Are you aware that this breed originated in Tevinter?</string>
  <string id="6170604">The magisters bred them. It's said the mabari defected during the Imperium's invasion of Ferelden.</string>
  <string id="6170607">Merely a tale, but I rather like the idea they found the barbarians more... palatable than the mages.</string>
  <string id="6170610">Happy bark!</string>
  <string id="6170613">Exactly so.</string>
  <string id="6170616">Let's hope your hound doesn't take after his ancestors too strongly, hmm?</string>
  <string id="6170624">You don't say?</string>
  <string id="6170627">But I can't find any record of you having a cousin Elmand.</string>
  <string id="6170630">I'll introduce you some time. He's a little on the shy side.</string>
  <string id="6170633">Varric. He's imaginary.</string>
  <string id="6170636">Which makes him a much better head of the household than I am. He never misses the Merchants Guild meetings, for one.</string>

  <string id="6170645">Aveline, I thought you'd have noticed by now: I lie a lot.</string>
  <string id="6170649">The Witch of the Wilds is a myth.</string>
  <string id="6170652">What can I say? That's what I was told.</string>
  <string id="6170655">So a myth swooped out of the Wilds to save the Champion? I'm expected to believe that?</string>
  <string id="6170658">And you wondered why I began with the legend.</string>

  <string id="6170702">Yes, I know. And that nothing is costing me a fortune.</string>
  <string id="6170705">They're enormous! And they're always empty. Why don't more people go to see them?</string>
  <string id="6170708">Probably because they're private and surrounded by guards.</string>

  <string id="6170767">Fourth Ingredient</string>

  <string id="6170979">I could tell you a story of the Dread Wolf, if you like.</string>
  <string id="6170982">They're a cutthroat bunch. You've got a long way to go to be their quality.</string>
  <string id="6171026">So, you're a prince, are you?</string>
  <string id="6171029">That is apparently true.</string>
  <string id="6171032">There's doubt?</string>
  <string id="6171035">I've accepted the burden. That's all that matters. Why do you ask, Guard-Captain?</string>
  <string id="6171038">The entitled types are always trouble.</string>
  <string id="6171041">In that case, I'm glad I don't count myself as one.</string>
  <string id="6171044">They never do.</string>
  <string id="6171048">You don't like me, Guard-Captain?</string>
  <string id="6171051">I've no issue, so long as the fight over your title stays in Starkhaven. Exactly like it hasn't.</string>
  <string id="6171054">Should I apologize for trying to take back what is rightfully mine?</string>
  <string id="6171057">Whatever it takes? No matter the cost?</string>
  <string id="6171060">It feels like you're blaming me for some personal experience of yours.</string>
  <string id="6171063">I was at Ostagar. Good people die when leaders do whatever it takes.</string>
  <string id="6171066">Good people know the necessity.</string>
  <string id="6171070">Has Starkhaven called for its lost prince, Sebastian? Would you give up if the city has moved on?</string>

  <string id="6171076">You've been reading.</string>
  <string id="6171079">It's a good tale. King Alistair is particularly inspiring. But I doubt that's how you see me.</string>
  <string id="6171082">It's a good tale. I'm inspired by the Warden Alistair... but I doubt that's how you see me.</string>
  <string id="6171085">I don't intend to let anyone die restoring me to my place, Aveline. The risks are mine. And that will have to satisfy.</string>
  <string id="6171088">I'm no tyrant. If people die restoring me to my place, they'll do it knowing the risk.</string>
  <string id="6171091">If that doesn't satisfy, so be it.</string>
  <string id="6171094">After your actions here? No. It doesn't.</string>
  <string id="6171098">Are you loyal, Prince?</string>
  <string id="6171101">Guard-Captain?</string>
  <string id="6171104">To Kirkwall. Are you loyal?</string>
  <string id="6171107">The concerns of the Chantry are not always... earthly. Is your head down here or in the clouds?</string>
  <string id="6171110">I'm grounded enough to know that you ask because of your own doubts. It must have been painful.</string>
  <string id="6171113">What was?</string>
  <string id="6171116">The challenge of faith that wounded you. Are you saddened that you've lost your way?</string>
  <string id="6171122">That's... a fair question. I'm content, Sebastian. I have all I need.</string>
  <string id="6171126">I...  have not lost my way. I have found it. And I am watching you.</string>
  <string id="6171130">You're set on a title in Starkhaven, but we're having a crisis here.</string>
  <string id="6171133">This isn't just a Kirkwall concern. If this chaos spreads, Starkhaven will need a strong ruler to beat back the tide.</string>
  <string id="6171136">I've seen greater men than you use that excuse.</string>
  <string id="6171139">Noted and ignored, Captain.</string>
  <string id="6171156">Happy bark!</string>
  <string id="6171159">Oh, you like that part? Shall I keep going?</string>
  <string id="6171160">Ever since, the Dread Wolf thinks twice about playing his tricks when dogs are on guard.</string>
  <string id="6171163">Happy bark!</string>
  <string id="6171168">I sure hope he makes it. He's getting too old for this shit.</string>
  <string id="6171199">Yet a sensible one.</string>
  <string id="6171202">That's more gracious than I'd expect, according to all the rumors.</string>
  <string id="6171203">She said that?</string>
  <string id="6171204">Well... those weren't her precise words, that's true. They still deserve to be said.</string>

  <string id="6171296">It's a ruse. The Qunari aren't waiting for a boat. They're waiting for reinforcements from Par Vollen.</string>
  <string id="6171299">Reinforcements would come by sea. Technically, they are waiting for a boat.</string>
  <string id="6171306">Of course they're going to attack. Everyone knows it.</string>
  <string id="6171309">If the Qunari conquer the Free Marches, they will have access to the southern border of the Tevinter Imperium.</string>
  <string id="6171312">They'd launch a double-pronged attack from both North and South.</string>
  <string id="6171315">That would take forever.</string>
  <string id="6171318">I don't think the Qunari are much concerned with how long things take.</string>
  <string id="6171321">Now isn't the time.</string>
  <string id="6171325">It's a perfect time for Orlais to invade. Ferelden lost most of her standing army in the struggle against the Blight.</string>

Years past, I fell into wickedness and was swept up in the mad ambitions of the blood mage Tarohne. You spared my life at the Blooming Rose, and for many months, I wished you had killed me. But I found the Maker's Light in my deepest despair, and I now seek absolution.&#13;
&#13;
Tarohne wrote many tomes containing dark secrets she learned from the Fade. She protected them with demons forged into their very bindings. You must find and destroy these tomes, lest others follow her dark path. I wish I could help you, but the templars never let me leave my cell. I can only send my prayers.&#13;
&#13;

  <string id="6171374">Leave Area</string>
  <string id="6171380">Dumar's been burying his head in the sand, pretending the Qunari aren't here.</string>
  <string id="6171383">He fears provoking them.</string>
  <string id="6171386">Ha! Is there anything Dumar doesn't fear?</string>
  <string id="6171387">You have to admit, the Qunari haven't done anything.</string>
  <string id="6171390">That doesn't mean they'll continue doing nothing.</string>
  <string id="6171393">I just don't understand. What do they want?</string>
  <string id="6171394">An alliance with the other states would allow us to drive the Qunari from Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6171397">And why should they care? I'm sure they're more than happy to let Kirkwall play host to the oxmen.</string>
  <string id="6171400">The Qunari threaten all of us.</string>
  <string id="6171403">Not for the moment.</string>
  <string id="6171406">You'd think someone would've stepped into Dumar's shoes by now.</string>
  <string id="6171409">Does anyone want the job? Do you want the job?</string>
  <string id="6171412">Of course not. Not with Orsino and Meredith at each other's throats. I'd hate to be caught between those two.</string>
  <string id="6171413">Meredith needs to calm down and look at what she's done.</string>
  <string id="6171425">She believes she's right. It will never change.</string>
  <string id="6171428">Kirkwall chafes under Meredith's control, and her first instinct is to tighten her fist.</string>
  <string id="6171431">Something's going to give, and when it does, we'll all pay for it.</string>
  <string id="6171432">Noble families harboring mages? That's a recipe for disaster. Why would anyone take such a risk?</string>
  <string id="6171435">Why does anyone take risks? To protect an ideal.</string>
  <string id="6171437">Seems only fair.</string>
  <string id="6171440">Not all of us are.</string>
  <string id="6171443">I quite agree.</string>
  <string id="6171446">Seems like you templars could use all the help you can get!</string>
  <string id="6171447">And you don't need help?</string>
  <string id="6171448">Is it that simple?</string>
  <string id="6171451">Every mage?</string>
  <string id="6171454">A slaver.</string>
  <string id="6171459">Hand him over, then, if you're serious.</string>
  <string id="6171460">Fair enough.</string>
  <string id="6171461">We will, once you're dead.</string>
  <string id="6171462">After we kill you.</string>
  <string id="6171463">Oh? That's quite a generous offer.</string>
  <string id="6171464">You're too kind.</string>
  <string id="6171468">Time to die, little man.</string>
  <string id="6171471">Why are we even talking? Kill him!</string>
  <string id="6171498">Yes, evidently so.</string>
  <string id="6171507">Aww, he's like you were. Do you remember, Aveline? When you were stupid over Donnic?</string>
  <string id="6171510">Yes, I remember. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6171513">I can't believe we wasted our time on this... idiot.</string>
  <string id="6171516">Would she know it to see it?</string>
  <string id="6171519">A user. Just looking for another handout.</string>
  <string id="6171522">And people wonder why templars don't accept no.</string>
  <string id="6171525">Orlesians.</string>
  <string id="6171526">Isabela, you never talk about the mages' plight.</string>
  <string id="6171529">What's there to say?</string>
  <string id="6171532">There's plenty to say.</string>
  <string id="6171535">And you say enough for the lot of us, don't you think?</string>
  <string id="6171538">So you're telling me you have no opinion on the matter?</string>
  <string id="6171541">None whatsoever!</string>
  <string id="6171544">That can't be true.</string>
  <string id="6171547">No, I'm afraid I'm really this shallow.</string>

  <string id="6171863">My faith was never strong. It's difficult for a slave to have faith in someone who abandoned them.</string>
  <string id="6171866">The Maker didn't enslave you, Fenris.</string>
  <string id="6171869">He didn't help me much, either.</string>
  <string id="6171872">And yet you stand here, free. Perhaps He helped you more than you think.</string>
  <string id="6171873">The Maker didn't free me.</string>
  <string id="6171876">I see you've been thinking about what I said.</string>
  <string id="6171879">I freed myself. If the Maker did anything, He watched. Why should I thank Him for that?</string>
  <string id="6171882">Is it so hard to believe the Maker cares for you? Maybe He gave you the chance to escape.</string>
  <string id="6171885">It doesn't feel like the Maker cares for me... or anyone.</string>
  <string id="6171888">We all make our own choices, to do good as well as evil. That is our doing, not the Maker's.</string>
  <string id="6171891">Perhaps. It's... been a long time since I gave it any thought.</string>
  <string id="6171894">It's not too late to start.</string>
  <string id="6171895">I saw you at the chantry last week, Fenris, but I haven't seen you back since.</string>
  <string id="6171898">I was only delivering something; you needn't concern yourself.</string>

  <string id="6171945">What has my vengeance accomplished except to spill more blood?</string>

  <string id="6172392">Yes, the mages had nothing to do with it.</string>
  <string id="6172395">So the templars are absolved of all responsibility? You can't be that big an idiot.</string>
  <string id="6172398">You think their crimes will allow anyone to trust you more?</string>
  <string id="6172401">You don't think the mages are even a little responsible for their crimes?</string>
  <string id="6172404">We hunt wolves as well, when they become a danger.</string>
  <string id="6172407">Bureaucrat</string>
  <string id="6172411">It is filthy.</string>
  <string id="6172417">Bureaucrat</string>
  <string id="6172419">Keep Guard</string>
  <string id="6172421">Empty promises.</string>
  <string id="6172424">Keep Guard</string>
  <string id="6172426">Keep Guard</string>
  <string id="6172428">Keep Guard</string>
  <string id="6172430">It's always the same. Always.</string>
  <string id="6172433">Guardsman Garol</string>
  <string id="6172435">Keep Maid</string>
  <string id="6172437">Keep Servant</string>
  <string id="6172439">Keep Servant</string>
  <string id="6172441">Nobleman</string>
  <string id="6172443">Noblewoman</string>
  <string id="6172467">Justice is a funny concept.</string>
  <string id="6172470">It'll drive a man to perform the noblest deeds.</string>
  <string id="6172473">As well as the worst atrocities.</string>
  <string id="6172476">Justice is a blade that draws blood from the innocent and wicked alike.</string>
  <string id="6172479">And raised high, it can lead a charge that changes the world forever.</string>
  <string id="6172483">Reach down into your heart and you’ll find many reasons to fight.</string>
  <string id="6172486">Survival. Honor. Glory.</string>
  <string id="6172489">But what about those who feel it's their duty to protect the innocent?</string>
  <string id="6172492">There you’ll find a warrior savage enough to match any dragon.</string>
  <string id="6172495">And in the end they’ll retain what the others won’t: their humanity.</string>
  <string id="6172499">Some men would fight anyone, kill anyone to gain their freedom.</string>
  <string id="6172502">But I know you can break your chains and yet remain a prisoner.</string>
  <string id="6172505">You can carry that darkness around inside you.</string>
  <string id="6172508">Until it burns itself into your flesh.</string>
  <string id="6172511">And changes you forever.</string>
  <string id="6172515">Sometimes people will surprise you.</string>
  <string id="6172518">They come to you in the form of a wink and a slow smile.</string>
  <string id="6172521">Pick your pocket and deceive you at every turn.</string>
  <string id="6172524">But when push comes to shove, they’re the ones that have your back.</string>
  <string id="6172527">And you can’t imagine anyone else you’d rather have there.</string>
  <string id="6172531">To the elves, loss is an old and familiar enemy.</string>
  <string id="6172534">Their homeland, their history, their very place in the world.</string>
  <string id="6172537">What would you do if you could get it all back?</string>
  <string id="6172540">Would you walk down a forbidden path?</string>
  <string id="6172543">Would you sacrifice your soul?</string>
  <string id="6172547">The man that tells the tale is the one who decides history.</string>
  <string id="6172550">He tells it wrong, and you have nothing more than a pretty story.</string>
  <string id="6172553">He tells it right—and you have a legacy.</string>
  <string id="6172556">You want a story told right, you ask someone who helped make it happen.</string>
  <string id="6172559">And if that someone is me—I’ll make it awesome.</string>
  <string id="6172568">I'm not sure we should be doing this...</string>
  <string id="6172571">But wouldn't that give a demon an open door into our world? That's bad, right?</string>
  <string id="6172577">So many refugees. The Blight is over—don't you all want to return home?</string>
  <string id="6172578">As if Ferelden didn't have enough problems.</string>
  <string id="6172582">How long will the Qunari be allowed to stay? It's not right.</string>
  <string id="6172583">Do you know if the Qunari are leaving soon? They're making the guilds nervous.</string>
  <string id="6172587">How do you do, Champion?</string>
  <string id="6172588">You are always welcome at my shop.</string>
  <string id="6172590">Maker preserve us. What will happen if there is a war?</string>
  <string id="6172594">Come, don't be shy! Look around!</string>
  <string id="6172595">A fine day for business, messere?</string>
  <string id="6172596">Come, feel free to browse my wares!</string>
  <string id="6172597">You look like an enterprising young man!</string>
  <string id="6172598">You look like a respectable young woman!</string>
  <string id="6172605">Elves at Large</string>
  <string id="6172606">Track down the elven blood mages for the templars.</string>
  <string id="6172607">What was that about?</string>
  <string id="6172610">Assassins. The boat to Rivain is within sight, but the Carta would see me dead before I get there.</string>
  <string id="6172613">How would you like to make some coin?</string>
  <string id="6172614">Dispatch these ruffians and I'll pay you what I can now. And by the ancestors, I will reward you proper when I am safe.</string>
  <string id="6172626">I'll give you twelve bits.</string>
  <string id="6172629">How's ten bits for that?</string>
  <string id="6172632">No higher than thirteen.</string>
  <string id="6172635">You cannot be serious! Twenty or nothing.</string>
  <string id="6172638">Have you not examined the craftsmanship?</string>
  <string id="6172641">You must have me mistaken for one who sells low-quality junk.</string>
  <string id="6172644">That's absurd! What do you take me for?</string>
  <string id="6172647">Then find yourself a new customer.</string>
  <string id="6172648">Very well. Eighteen, but no higher.</string>
  <string id="6172649">What do you take me for? It isn't worth that much!</string>
  <string id="6172653">I'll give you three silvers.</string>
  <string id="6172656">It's not worth more than two.</string>
  <string id="6172659">I'll go no higher than four.</string>
  <string id="6172662">You cannot be serious! Eight silvers!</string>
  <string id="6172665">Seven silvers or it's an insult to my family!</string>
  <string id="6172668">Bah! You want to put me in the poor house?</string>
  <string id="6172671">Highway robbery! I cannot let it go for that!</string>
  <string id="6172674">Forget it, then.</string>
  <string id="6172675">I'll give you five, but not a single bit more.</string>
  <string id="6172676">Enough with the dramatics. Four, or I leave.</string>
  <string id="6172677">Stand down. She's not our foe.</string>
  <string id="6172680">Apostate</string>
  <string id="6172691">You seem very angry.</string>
  <string id="6172694">And here I thought the Chantry was against mind-reading.</string>
  <string id="6172697">Did something happen to you in the Circle? I understand there were problems in Ferelden...</string>
  <string id="6172700">Are you saying a mage can only be unhappy in the Circle if demons are involved?</string>
  <string id="6172703">No, it's not about Uldred. It's not about being beaten or raped by a templar— that does happen, but I've been fortunate.</string>
  <string id="6172706">It's a larger principle: the freedom every man, woman, and child born in Thedas have as a natural right.</string>
  <string id="6172709">You were given to the Circle. I was given to the Chantry. Hawke was driven away from home by darkspawn.</string>
  <string id="6172712">None of us are free.</string>
  <string id="6172713">So your Tranquil Solution was hardly the holocaust you imagined.</string>
  <string id="6172716">You've been seeking revenge for the death of one family for as long as I've known you.</string>
  <string id="6172719">Are you honestly judging me for trying to save the lives of every mage in Thedas?</string>
  <string id="6172722">But they were never threatened. It was a single man's lunacy.</string>
  <string id="6172725">The Chantry would never follow through with such a thing.</string>
  <string id="6172728">Yet.</string>
  <string id="6172729">How can you keep standing up for her?</string>
  <string id="6172732">Who?</string>
  <string id="6172735">That doddering old biddy of a grand cleric.</string>
  <string id="6172738">How dare you! Elthina is everything a grand cleric should be. She's holy, wise—</string>
  <string id="6172741">Spineless... hesitant. She's clay in Meredith's hands.</string>
  <string id="6172744">In the face of danger, sometimes the bravest thing is to stand back and trust that the Maker will see justice done.</string>
  <string id="6172747">Well if doing nothing sums up your religion, then Elthina is perfect. Personally, I'd prefer a Chantry that favors action over sloth.</string>
  <string id="6172748">You've made no secret of your intent to lead the mages here in revolution.</string>
  <string id="6172751">Well, I've tried not to shout it from the rooftops. You've just been around when I talk with my friends.</string>
  <string id="6172754">Well, as we have mutual friends—who for some reason don't want you to get hurt—let me tell you this:</string>
  <string id="6172757">If you go forward with this revolt, the Chantry will bring its full might to bear. They will kill you.</string>
  <string id="6172760">Andraste was killed. That doesn't mean she failed.</string>
  <string id="6172763">Do not compare yourself to Andraste.</string>
  <string id="6172767">I understand you are of noble birth.</string>
  <string id="6172770">My father was a chevalier. He had to flee Orlais when his patron was murdered.</string>
  <string id="6172773">I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="6172776">I wouldn't have been suited for the life of an Orlesian noblewoman, anyway.</string>
  <string id="6172779">But surely you wish it had been different? To be a lady of Orlais and not a... city guardsman?</string>
  <string id="6172782">Not for one moment.</string>
  <string id="6172785">I'd rather kill a bandit and save a merchant's family than know the correct dance steps and which rouge is in fashion.</string>
  <string id="6172786">I hope this wasn't presumptuous, but I added your husband's name to the memorial wall in the chantry.</string>
  <string id="6172789">Wesley? But... you never knew him.</string>
  <string id="6172792">He was a templar. He refused to abandon the people of Ferelden to the Blight. He died too young.</string>
  <string id="6172795">The grand cleric will read his name during the Chant of Remembrance.</string>
  <string id="6172798">Thank you. That is... very kind.</string>
  <string id="6172801">He walks with the Maker. But it is no shame for those left behind to mourn.</string>
  <string id="6172802">What have I done now? You look like you wish to scold me.</string>
  <string id="6172805">I just can't fathom why you're still in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6172808">For six years, you've been claiming you'll retake your parents' lands.</string>
  <string id="6172811">You're smart, you'd be a capable ruler. What are you waiting for?</string>
  <string id="6172817">I don't know if it's the right thing to do.</string>
  <string id="6172820">Do we ever get to know that?</string>
  <string id="6172821">Do you have many dealings with the knight-commander?</string>
  <string id="6172824">Please don't start with that. I'm not a templar. I'm the captain of the guard.</string>
  <string id="6172827">We arrest burglars. The knight-commander never gives us a thought.</string>
  <string id="6172830">Grand Cleric Elthina is worried about her. She's stopped taking the Chantry's advice.</string>
  <string id="6172833">Her job's not easy. Certain... forces in the city are allied against her.</string>
  <string id="6172836">Don't try to be subtle. I'm right here.</string>
  <string id="6172839">Clearly, our templars need strong leaders.</string>
  <string id="6172842">Until something changes, that's Meredith. And we must give her any support we are able.</string>
  <string id="6172846">Were you ever dedicated in the faith of the Chantry?</string>
  <string id="6172849">I have no memory of my childhood.</string>
  <string id="6172852">Danarius had no desire to teach his slaves anything that made them think they're worthy beings.</string>
  <string id="6172855">I'm sorry. I can't imagine how difficult your life has been.</string>
  <string id="6172858">No, you can't.</string>
  <string id="6172861">Whether you were taught it or not, the Maker has room at his side for every soul. Even yours.</string>
  <string id="6172862">You know, Fenris, as a brother in the Chantry, I'm allowed to hear confessions.</string>
  <string id="6172865">Why would you tell me this?</string>
  <string id="6172868">I know Danarius made you do things. I thought you might be more comfortable talking to a friend.</string>
  <string id="6172871">You should know, a murder committed under duress is a sin on the one ordered it, not the one whose hands carried out the deed.</string>
  <string id="6172874">Have I not spoken enough of my past? Does everyone in Kirkwall wish to hear every sordid detail?</string>
  <string id="6172877">I know I do.</string>
  <string id="6172880">Sometimes, it's painful to speak. But it's the only way the wound can be lanced.</string>
  <string id="6172881">Terrible things do happen, Sebastian.</string>
  <string id="6172884">But what we see is only a piece of the puzzle. Only the Maker can see the greater picture.</string>
  <string id="6172893">The guilty prosper. Innocents die.</string>
  <string id="6172896">And then they are brought to the side of the Maker. Their suffering ends. There is always a greater purpose.</string>
  <string id="6172899">Danarius once killed a little boy to fuel blood magic that let him impress his fellow Senators at a party. What was the purpose there?</string>
  <string id="6172902">Perhaps it was witnessing that which will give you the strength to prevent it ever happening again.</string>
  <string id="6172903">It's our duty to tell the templars.</string>
  <string id="6172906">Then why haven't you done it?</string>
  <string id="6172909">I guess I was hoping they'd come to it on their own.</string>
  <string id="6172912">And then you wouldn't have to betray Hawke's friends, right?</string>
  <string id="6172918">That's not reason enough to allow a maleficar to walk free.</string>
  <string id="6172921">You think the templars don't know I'm here? They just haven't caught me yet.</string>
  <string id="6172924">Are you talking about me?</string>
  <string id="6172927">Which of us should do it? Shall we draw lots?</string>
  <string id="6172930">Uh-uh. You want to turn them in, you work it out with Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6172934">Is this getting you any closer to your ship?</string>
  <string id="6172937">Huh?</string>
  <string id="6172940">I just... don't understand why you're working with Hawke. You don't seem to care about anything we do.</string>
  <string id="6172943">What's keeping you here?</string>
  <string id="6172946">Mostly the sex.</string>
  <string id="6172949">Hawke's an absolute tiger between the sheets. I mean, all night, every night.</string>
  <string id="6172952">Oh, cute! You're blushing!</string>
  <string id="6172953">Mostly the Blooming Rose. I'm paid up through the end of the year. I'd hate not to use it.</string>
  <string id="6172956">The... brothel?</string>
  <string id="6172959">What? Women can't go to brothels, too? You're just not using your imagination.</string>
  <string id="6172962">Oh, look! Now you are. You're cute when you're blushing.</string>
  <string id="6172963">I used to be like you, you know.</string>
  <string id="6172966">You used to be a woman?</string>
  <string id="6172969">No!</string>
  <string id="6172972">That explains a lot.</string>
  <string id="6172975">My family put me in the Chantry because I was giving them a bad name.</string>
  <string id="6172978">It was the best thing that ever happened to me. I found peace. I found a purpose.</string>
  <string id="6172981">Before I came here, I used to be out to all hours, drinking and whoring. I didn't believe in anything except my own pleasure.</string>
  <string id="6172984">Why couldn't I have met you then?</string>
  <string id="6172985">That was very brave, coming back to face the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6172988">It was idiotic. They would've killed me.</string>
  <string id="6172991">And you returned anyway. You couldn't face the thought of so many innocents dying for something you could prevent.</string>
  <string id="6172994">Tell that to the viscount.</string>
  <string id="6172997">It's frightening, isn't it, to realize you have the potential to be a better person?</string>
  <string id="6173007">So, I've never understood why the Chantry says if you're good, you'll be taken up to the Maker's side.</string>
  <string id="6173010">Those who die with the sins cleansed from their souls will walk beside the Maker in eternity.</string>
  <string id="6173013">That doesn't sound fun!</string>
  <string id="6173016">If they really want people to be good, shouldn't they offer an afterlife with... lakes of wine and a dozen naked virgins?</string>
  <string id="6173019">Anyone who wants that will be going to the Void.</string>
  <string id="6173022">Sounds like that's where all the good parties will be.</string>
  <string id="6173026">Have you heard the Chant of Light?</string>
  <string id="6173029">That's the song they sing at the chantry, right? It's pretty... but a little repetitive.</string>
  <string id="6173032">Then you know the story? How Andraste became the Maker's divine bride and convinced Him to offer us a second chance?</string>
  <string id="6173035">Right. But I never understood why she had to die.</string>
  <string id="6173038">Her mortal husband betrayed her out of jealousy.</string>
  <string id="6173041">But if He wanted her to spread her faith, couldn't she do that better alive?</string>
  <string id="6173044">The Maker gave us free will. By his betrayal, Maferath showed that men were not yet worth saving.</string>
  <string id="6173047">I don't know. It's a nice story, but I think it's got some holes.</string>
  <string id="6173048">So, what do you believe, Merrill?</string>
  <string id="6173051">Our gods abandoned us long ago. They haven't answered our prayers since the fall of Arlathan.</string>
  <string id="6173054">When we've proven that we're elves again, that we didn't lose everything, they'll come back to us.</string>
  <string id="6173057">We say the same of the Maker.</string>
  <string id="6173060">Perhaps they're only different names for the same divine force that created the world.</string>
  <string id="6173063">The Maker wants you to be elves?</string>
  <string id="6173076">What does your Chantry do?</string>
  <string id="6173079">I mean, you keep saying how great it is. Anders and Isabela tell me to stay away from it. But what does it do?</string>
  <string id="6173082">Among the Dalish, the Keepers teach the children, preserve our history, perform magic. The priestesses here just... sing.</string>
  <string id="6173085">The Chantry does many charitable works. It cares for widows and orphans—</string>
  <string id="6173088">Who in the Dalish would just be part of the clan, like everyone else.</string>
  <string id="6173089">You need to seek atonement.</string>
  <string id="6173092">I know I should have died there, not Marethari. Don't you think I feel guilty enough? </string>
  <string id="6173095">Guilt isn't a punishment. It's a reminder there are things you haven't set right.</string>
  <string id="6173098">The only way to shed its burden is to repent with a sincere heart and rectify your failings.</string>
  <string id="6173101">But how?</string>
  <string id="6173104">My entire clan is dead because of me.</string>
  <string id="6173107">The Keeper is dead. My clan lost everything because of me.</string>
  <string id="6173110">There's not enough I can do in this lifetime to make up for that.</string>
  <string id="6173113">It was your pride that led you to the demon. Admitting what you can't do is a good first step.</string>
  <string id="6173117">It's been very exciting working with Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6173120">Are you for real?</string>
  <string id="6173123">It seems like she's involved every time something goes wrong in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6173126">It seems like he's involved every time there's a crisis in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6173129">I've never had so many opportunities to help people!</string>
  <string id="6173132">All right. I thought I was getting tired of moody. I take it back.</string>
  <string id="6173135">You're making my teeth ache.</string>
  <string id="6173136">You must forgive your brother.</string>
  <string id="6173139">While you were off playing prince, Bartrand trapped us in the Deep Roads and left us to die.</string>
  <string id="6173142">When you hold onto anger, it colors everything you do.</string>
  <string id="6173145">You escaped the Deep Roads. You built a life without your brother. Do you still want him haunting you?</string>
  <string id="6173148">Oh, go find some beggars to sing to, will you?</string>
  <string id="6173149">You know, if you have time, I could give you a few archery pointers.</string>
  <string id="6173152">Excuse me?</string>
  <string id="6173155">Sometimes your shots veer a little left. I thought maybe your cocking ring was off.</string>
  <string id="6173158">I could take a look if you like.</string>
  <string id="6173161">You want to touch Bianca's cocking ring?</string>
  <string id="6173164">It was just a thought.</string>
  <string id="6173165">So, I've known you for three years now. I give up. You beat me. What is it?</string>
  <string id="6173171">You like boys? Sheep? You slept with your sister?</string>
  <string id="6173174">What are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="6173177">What are you hiding? Nobody's this bloody clean.</string>
  <string id="6173180">After you leave the chantry you... get drunk at the Hanged Man and walk around in women's clothes?</string>
  <string id="6173183">Not that I've seen. Unfortunately.</string>
  <string id="6173186">I've been honest with you and Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6173189">Liar.</string>

  <string id="6173215">In the past fortnight, seven apostates have been captured because of one templar: Ser Conrad Vernhart. It is never wise to underestimate a templar's intelligence, but Ser Conrad is both brilliant and ruthless. We must remove this threat. Killing him is not an option—he must be disgraced, removed from Kirkwall, and, ideally, cast out of the templar order.&#13;
&#13;
Fortunately for us, the templars now fear they've been infiltrated by a blood mage's puppets. Of the several templars who are watching their own, one is deep in the throws of lyrium and can be fooled. His name is Ser Roderick, and he frequents the Hanged Man. His testimony alone will be dubious, so we must search the Gallows and Lowtown for any slight or fabrication that can defame Ser Conrad... before we all fall.</string>
  <string id="6173216">Find ways to slander Ser Conrad Vernhart. Ser Roderick in the Hanged Man is investigating corrupt templars. There may be other opportunities in Lowtown and the Gallows.</string>

  <string id="6173330">All right, let's just get this over with.</string>
  <string id="6173333">A duel?</string>
  <string id="6173336">No, the sermon. The finger-wagging, the guilt-trips, telling me how an unexamined life isn't worth living.</string>
  <string id="6173339">I wasn't going to—</string>
  <string id="6173342">You weren't? You weren't going to tell me to comfort the needy and give freely of myself?</string>

  <string id="6173361">Um. I don't see—</string>
  <string id="6173364">Hold still!</string>
  <string id="6173371">It's been years, and not once have you tried to get me to repent or turn to the Maker.</string>

  <string id="6173408">Before I met you, I had no idea places like this existed. Thanks for that.</string>
  <string id="6173409">Why would anyone shop here instead of an actual store?</string>
  <string id="6173410">The Qunari should keep to their lands and we to ours.</string>
  <string id="6173411">The Gallows is rather dreadful, isn't it. Maybe the mages here would be more tractable if they were housed somewhere else.</string>
  <string id="6173412">Traveling with you is certainly... broadening.</string>
  <string id="6173413">Why do these people not come to the chantry? The brothers and sisters would find a place for them.</string>
  <string id="6173414">Don't ever tell anyone I did this.</string>
  <string id="6173415">I think a few of these templars escaped the fire in Starkhaven.</string>

  <string id="6173581">Of course. No harm ever comes from good intentions, even when magic is involved.</string>

  <string id="6173650">He had just been invested as a brother when we got the news about his family.</string>
  <string id="6173653">I'm afraid he reacted rashly—denied his vows and left the Chantry. If the Maker wills it, he will return to himself before it's too late.</string>
  <string id="6173654">So he's some kind of priest?</string>
  <string id="6173655">He's a brother?</string>
  <string id="6173656">He is an initiate of the faith.</string>
  <string id="6173659">As a man, he cannot serve as a mother would, but he has led the Chant here many times.</string>
  <string id="6173662">Before last week, I would have said he was the most faithful of our true believers.</string>
  <string id="6173663">Sebastian is the youngest son of the ruling family of Starkhaven.</string>
  <string id="6173666">They were overthrown recently. Violently. Sebastian is the only surviving member.</string>
  <string id="6173667">He's royalty?</string>

  <string id="6173669">Prince Sebastian Vael... if he succeeds in his pledge to take back his lands.</string>
  <string id="6173672">He made a vow to the Maker to put worldly concerns behind him. </string>
  <string id="6173675">It is a sin to forswear himself for a mere title.</string>
  <string id="6173677">It looked like he was trying to post a job on the Chanter's board.</string>
  <string id="6173678">Can I help?</string>
  <string id="6173679">Sebastian would spend his coin to buy men's lives, the same as those who attacked his family.</string>
  <string id="6173682">No matter how justified he feels, that is murder.</string>
  <string id="6173685">And when he returns, I will tell him so again.</string>
  <string id="6173686">Is there anything else going on here?</string>
  <string id="6173687">Forget Sebastian.</string>

  <string id="6173738">With help, the elven apostates escaped Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6173739">The elven apostates were killed. The mercenary split half the Chanter's reward for the help.</string>
  <string id="6173743">May the words of my heart reach you, bride of the Maker.</string>
  <string id="6173746">Look with mercy upon my family, Andraste, for they are now at your side.</string>

  <string id="6173769">Maybe it's time to realize your limitations.</string>

  <string id="6174053">That's ridiculous! How could anyone believe that?</string>
  <string id="6174056">Bah. It sickens me just to talk about it.</string>
  <string id="6174057">Kirkwall is going to the dogs, believe me.</string>
  <string id="6174058">It's pointless talk. Things will never change.</string>
  <string id="6174062">Did you just hear what those young upstarts said?</string>
  <string id="6174067">A distant cousin of mine is claiming rulership now, but he is... a bit simple.</string>
  <string id="6174070">He can be no more than a pawn in this plot.</string>
  <string id="6174071">Surely you have a guess as to who was behind it?</string>
  <string id="6174072">Who might have done it?</string>
  <string id="6174073">My parents were always... prudent... in how they handled our nobles. They did not allow rivalries or resentments to flourish.</string>
  <string id="6174076">The attack must have come from outside. Kirkwall is our largest trading partner.</string>
  <string id="6174079">I came back here to find support for my claim and perhaps for a clue as to who is behind this foul deed.</string>
  <string id="6174086">Spent some time in the Rose yesterday. It's amazing what you hear in there.</string>
  <string id="6174089">What's on your mind? You seem agitated.</string>
  <string id="6174092">I'm past caring about what people say. They're all fools.</string>
  <string id="6174093">They're right. We should ship all the mages off to Tevinter.</string>
  <string id="6174094">I don't want to talk about it. Let's get drunk.</string>
  <string id="6174108">Qunari Sword</string>
  <string id="6174110">Not bad, Hawke. Not bad at all.</string>
  <string id="6174113">But there's not really a fire, is there?</string>
  <string id="6174116">No, Merrill. It's a trick.</string>
  <string id="6174119">Oh! That's very clever, then!</string>
  <string id="6174141">A guardsman here? Laughs</string>
  <string id="6174142">Pretty weapons. Better keep them close.</string>
  <string id="6174146">Pretty rich to be walking here.</string>
  <string id="6174153">The guard captain? Well shit me sunshine.</string>
  <string id="6174157">The Champion? You got some tits on ya to come down here.</string>
  <string id="6174158">The Champion? Naw, you ain't him. He's taller.</string>
  <string id="6174164">Rather be free down here. I guess.</string>
  <string id="6174165">Alone in the dark, and that's how we like it.</string>
  <string id="6174166">Going to have to do some shopping upstairs pretty soon.</string>
  <string id="6174167">Don't like Darktown? Die and make room.</string>
  <string id="6174169">I'm still looking.</string>
  <string id="6174170">No.</string>
  <string id="6174183">Maker turn his gaze on you, child.</string>
  <string id="6174184">Walk in peace.</string>
  <string id="6174185">Andraste's grace be with you.</string>
  <string id="6174189">Blessed are the peacekeepers, the champions of the just.</string>
  <string id="6174190">Blessed are the righteous, the lights in the shadow. In their blood the Maker's will is written.</string>
  <string id="6174191">Though all before me is shadow, yet shall the Maker be my guide.</string>
  <string id="6174192">All men are the work of our Maker's hands, from the lowest slaves, to the highest kings.</string>
  <string id="6174193">The Chantry is open to all. Come, rest your heart, and hear the words of our Prophet.</string>
  <string id="6174194">Repent, and the Maker will forgive.</string>
  <string id="6174195">Have faith, and the Maker will return.</string>
  <string id="6174214">Good day to you.</string>
  <string id="6174215">Good evening, serah.</string>
  <string id="6174219">So much to do, so little time.</string>
  <string id="6174220">All this trouble in Kirkwall is bad for business.</string>
  <string id="6174221">Is there no one reliable in this town?</string>
  <string id="6174225">I'm going to get robbed, I just know it.</string>
  <string id="6174226">How did it get so dark so quickly?</string>
  <string id="6174227">The shipment's late again. Now what am I to do?</string>
  <string id="6174228">I'm going to lose my shop at this rate.</string>
  <string id="6174229">Where is that chit? Blast. I have to go back to get it.</string>
  <string id="6174239">Oy, Varric.</string>
  <string id="6174242">Oy, yourself.</string>
  <string id="6174243">What are you looking at?</string>

  <string id="6174304">Bah. I should never have left Orzammar.</string>
  <string id="6174305">Can't trust those pointy-eared blighters. Want it done right, go do it yourself.</string>
  <string id="6174306">Told him to get me a wagon, and he gets me a flagon. That elf has the brains of a crab.</string>
  <string id="6174307">Lard-faced bugger. Trying to pull a fast one? I'm on to you.</string>
  <string id="6174308">I hate Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6174309">Charging me two sovereigns per pound? Does he think I'm made of gold?</string>

  <string id="6174315">Accept the quest.</string>
  <string id="6174316">Now go to he Wounded Coast to find those damned mages!</string>
  <string id="6174323">Laughs Yes, I hope I will. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6174328">Thank you. More than I can say. I truly did not expect anyone but me to take up this cause.</string>
  <string id="6174334">Consider this an advance. When I have secured my lands again, you will be paid royally.</string>
  <string id="6174337">Now if you'll excuse me, I must meet with the viscount and petition him for aid to a fellow city.</string>

  <string id="6174366">Go home. The streets aren't safe.</string>
  <string id="6174367">What are you doing out this late, citizen?</string>
  <string id="6174368">Stay alert. Keep close to areas you're familiar with.</string>
  <string id="6174369">If you see a blonde elf-girl, run. She's probably a blood mage.</string>
  <string id="6174370">Have you seen an elf about? Short, blonde hair, slight build?</string>
  <string id="6174371">The Maker guides my hand.</string>
  <string id="6174372">Do you know anything about the mage underground?</string>
  <string id="6174373">I seek any information on suspected apostates.</string>
  <string id="6174394">Nice escort. Won't help down here. Laughs</string>
  <string id="6174395">You're like bait in a barrel down here.</string>
  <string id="6174399">Keep out of the corners if you want to see daylight again.</string>
  <string id="6174406">Walking with the captain? Was your nan busy?</string>
  <string id="6174407">This ain't Hightown, Champion. Crawl home.</string>
  <string id="6174411">Nothing worth scavenging today.</string>
  <string id="6174412">Those shits better pay up.</string>
  <string id="6174413">Break some heads tomorrow, maybe. Good payday.</string>
  <string id="6174414">Outsiders think they can change us.</string>
  <string id="6174415">Take what I like. That's what I say.</string>
  <string id="6174416">Bah! Darkspawn. Here's the real dark.</string>
  <string id="6174422">Watch out by the Qunari Compound. They seem very angry.</string>
  <string id="6174426">It's late. I should get home.</string>
  <string id="6174427">Did you see that shadow? What was that?</string>
  <string id="6174428">I don't want no trouble, messere.</string>
  <string id="6174432">There's crazies in Darktown who eat human flesh.</string>
  <string id="6174436">You are from over the sea, are you not? Have you come to pray for those you left behind?</string>
  <string id="6174441">I think the Qunari are spying on us.</string>
  <string id="6174442">Stupid adulterous bitch. She's won't get away with this.</string>
  <string id="6174443">So hungry I could eat a horse.</string>
  <string id="6174444">I wonder if there's easy work down at the docks.</string>
  <string id="6174445">What does she take me for? We'll see how she likes being out on the street.</string>
  <string id="6174448">I hear the templars are paying people to turn in mages.</string>
  <string id="6174449">Get Aveline's gift.</string>
  <string id="6174450">Aveline's Gift</string>
  <string id="6174454">Too many mages in this town.</string>
  <string id="6174455">Hey... that's the Champion of Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6174462">Can't believe I got thrown out of the Hanged Man.</string>
  <string id="6174463">Why's everyone looking at me?</string>
  <string id="6174464">I should've joined the templar order.</string>
  <string id="6174465">Where's a whore when you need one?</string>
  <string id="6174466">I hate my life.</string>
  <string id="6174467">I hate my wife.</string>
  <string id="6174468">I hate nobles and all their coin.</string>
  <string id="6174480">Have you seen a little boy? He's about six-years-old. No?</string>
  <string id="6174481">Has anyone seen my son?</string>
  <string id="6174482">Maker, what if something's happened to him?</string>
  <string id="6174486">Just going about my business.</string>
  <string id="6174487">So many horrible things going on in the world.</string>
  <string id="6174488">I don't want any trouble.</string>
  <string id="6174489">I don't have enough coin. What am I going to do?</string>
  <string id="6174491">Too many people in Kirkwall these days.</string>
  <string id="6174492">Just keep walking. No one's going to bother you.</string>
  <string id="6174495">Dispose of Body</string>
  <string id="6174498">The poor man...</string>
  <string id="6174504">Kirkwall feels dangerous, even in daylight.</string>
  <string id="6174511">Never knew humans could be this poor.</string>
  <string id="6174512">Fereldans, Free Marchers, all shems are the same down here.</string>
  <string id="6174513">Freedom. What a crock.</string>
  <string id="6174517">Won't even hire us for the mines. What have ears got to do with digging?</string>
  <string id="6174518">Shems get richer. We sit and rot.</string>
  <string id="6174519">Rather die down here than in the alienage.</string>
  <string id="6174526">Make do for yourself. Not even Dalish to run to now.</string>
  <string id="6174527">Think we have it bad, them Dalish can't protect their own Keeper.</string>
  <string id="6174528">Shems have their Champion. Who do we have?</string>
  <string id="6174532">May as well be slaves. At least there'd be work.</string>
  <string id="6174533">Picking through the droppings of Hightown.</string>
  <string id="6174534">Just keep walking, shemlen.</string>
  <string id="6174535">I should've stayed in the alienage.</string>
  <string id="6174536">What a hole these shems carved.</string>
  <string id="6174537">Anything else?</string>
  <string id="6174544">I guess down here we're all equally poor.</string>
  <string id="6174545">Fereldans... I can still smell the dog on them.</string>
  <string id="6174546">Darktown... is there anywhere more pathetic?</string>
  <string id="6174550">I won't go to the mines. Dwarves dig, not elves.</string>
  <string id="6174551">Hightown can burn.</string>
  <string id="6174552">What gods allow this hole?</string>
  <string id="6174559">Dalish are all dead. This is the best we have.</string>
  <string id="6174560">I knew that Keeper was bad like all those Dalish primitives.</string>
  <string id="6174561">Should have let the Qunari take over.</string>
  <string id="6174567">I'd kill for some food. Again.</string>
  <string id="6174568">Wonder what old Elven for shit-heap was.</string>
  <string id="6174569">Beats the alienage. Barely.</string>
  <string id="6174581">Look at all the elves.</string>
  <string id="6174582">The alienage is overcrowded. Someone should do something about it.</string>
  <string id="6174583">The alienage is dirty, crowded, and full of awful elven diseases. Ugh.</string>
  <string id="6174584">Whores on the street. A brothel in the middle of Hightown. Shameless!</string>
  <string id="6174585">Don't give the beggars in Lowtown anything.</string>
  <string id="6174586">I'm moving to Hightown as soon as I can.</string>
  <string id="6174587">Watch out while you're in the docks. Nasty place.</string>
  <string id="6174588">Those Fereldan refugees have just taken over Kirkwall. Horrible.</string>
  <string id="6174589">Kirkwall's gone to the dogs. I should move to Starkhaven.</string>
  <string id="6174590">Snorts</string>
  <string id="6174591">It's not a terrible idea, really. A lot of people would benefit from Hawke running this town.</string>
  <string id="6174598">Alms for the poor?</string>
  <string id="6174601">Of course. Andraste's grace be with you.</string>
  <string id="6174604">May the Maker forgive you.</string>
  <string id="6174605">Have the Act 1 Opening dialogue with Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6174606">Act 1 Opening</string>
  <string id="6174611">Good day to you, Revered Mother.</string>
  <string id="6174614">Good day to you, Guardsman. Might you have something to donate to the needy?</string>
  <string id="6174617">Sorry, Mother, but I've got to look after my needs first.</string>
  <string id="6174618">But your feet didn't do anything wrong! Did they?</string>
  <string id="6174621">Well, of course not. Certainty's not pointy enough to make a good weapon.</string>
  <string id="6174627">Good day to you, my child. Would you like to make a donation to the Chantry?</string>
  <string id="6174630">Snickers My only wealth's between my legs, Mother, but you're welcome to that if you wish.</string>
  <string id="6174631">All the other dialogues</string>
  <string id="6174632">Other dialogs</string>
  <string id="6174642">I thought it would end here.</string>
  <string id="6174648">That young lady, Hawke, she decimated Flint Company. No survivors.</string>
  <string id="6174651">Young master Hawke destroyed Flint Company. None remain.</string>
  <string id="6174657">Yet... now that I know who sent them, it's harder to see their deaths as justice.</string>
  <string id="6174660">Death is never justice.</string>
  <string id="6174663">I— Hawke! We were just talking about you.</string>
  <string id="6174664">Saying good things, I hope?</string>
  <string id="6174665">Nothing bad, I trust?</string>
  <string id="6174666">Carry on. I love to eavesdrop.</string>
  <string id="6174667">Don't let me stop you.</string>
  <string id="6174687">Forgive me, Your Grace.</string>
  <string id="6174690">It is not enough to ask forgiveness for a sin you committed in full knowledge.</string>
  <string id="6174693">The Maker blessed us with minds and a conscience. He does not approve when we fail to use them.</string>
  <string id="6174696">I'm sorry—</string>
  <string id="6174699">I'm not the one you wronged.</string>
  <string id="6174703">Blessed are those who live in the sight of the Maker.</string>
  <string id="6174704">I wish I could have stayed here forever. I never wanted to rule Starkhaven.</string>
  <string id="6174705">It's always so peaceful here.</string>
  <string id="6174706">Doesn't just being here bring peace to your soul?</string>
  <string id="6174707">Hail Andraste, bride of the Maker...</string>
  <string id="6174714">Perhaps we should go to the chantry. There's more space to talk there.</string>
  <string id="6174715">Let us talk the next time you're at the chantry.</string>
  <string id="6174716">Come by the chantry some time. I'd like to ask you something.</string>
  <string id="6174717">We should talk back at the chantry.</string>
  <string id="6174718">If you have some time, I'd like to talk.</string>
  <string id="6174719">Let's go!</string>
  <string id="6174720">Which one?</string>
  <string id="6174721">Have the Act 2 Opening Dialogue.</string>
  <string id="6174722">Act 2 Opening</string>
  <string id="6174723">Midstage Friendship</string>
  <string id="6174724">Midstage Friendship</string>
  <string id="6174725">Midstage Rivalry</string>
  <string id="6174726">Midstage Rivalry</string>
  <string id="6174727">It's the Divine. Come all the way from Orlais to tell you, personally, what a jackass you are.</string>
  <string id="6174730">Is the Flint Company bothering you again?</string>
  <string id="6174731">Is there a problem?</string>
  <string id="6174745">Welcome, merchant.</string>
  <string id="6174748">Not here to sell today, Guardsman. My shipment's late.</string>
  <string id="6174751">Well, good luck to you then.</string>
  <string id="6174752">He sounds very busy. We won't be any trouble, we promise.</string>
  <string id="6174755">Oh, is that all? Nothing to worry about, then.</string>
  <string id="6174764">Remember what Kirkwall was like twenty years ago?</string>
  <string id="6174765">Things sure have changed since I was a boy.</string>
  <string id="6174766">Remember when we were young?</string>
  <string id="6174769">There was a lot more shit on the streets back then.</string>
  <string id="6174770">You could get a whore for two bits. Now you need a pocket lined with silver, or you're on your own.</string>
  <string id="6174774">Fewer Fereldans, that's for sure.</string>
  <string id="6174776">A villainous deed was committed last night! Elven blood mages assaulted a wing of the Gallows to break out their brethren. The templars repelled the assault and prevented the blood mages from liberating Feynriel, but it is now feared that the culprits have escaped the city. A generous bounty is offered for their capture. Time is of the essence!&#13;

  <string id="6174783">I miss Ferelden. I had a puppy.</string>
  <string id="6174784">Can we go home? Maybe 'spawn left our house.</string>
  <string id="6174785">My brother died on a boat.</string>
  <string id="6174789">Ferelden was green. Not like here.</string>
  <string id="6174790">I have to squint in Lowtown. It's too sunny.</string>
  <string id="6174791">I ate a nug once. It was brown.</string>
  <string id="6174795">Templars and mages are fighting. We're lucky we're down here.</string>
  <string id="6174796">Rich people stink like flowers.</string>
  <string id="6174797">We have a Champion now. Coughs</string>
  <string id="6174801">I just want to see the stars. That's what I miss.</string>
  <string id="6174803">Coughs</string>
  <string id="6174804">I see funny things when I'm hungry.</string>

  <string id="6174810">You picked a fight with an elf who can rip the heart right out of your chest, lady. If the boot fits...</string>
  <string id="6174813">Hawke? Maybe now isn't a good time to offer the elf constructive criticism.</string>
  <string id="6174818">Many people in Kirkwall have good things to say about you.</string>
  <string id="6174821">Laughs I'd rather talk directly, if you don't mind.</string>
  <string id="6174824">I have no complaint with your work.</string>
  <string id="6174827">I've learned who hired Flint Company—the Harimanns, a noble family of Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6174830">They were my parents' allies. It's hard to believe they betrayed us like this.</string>
  <string id="6174853">Harimann?</string>
  <string id="6174860">I had... heard he was murdered.</string>
  <string id="6174863">I think I've met Lord Harimann.</string>
  <string id="6174869">Tell me about this family.</string>
  <string id="6174872">Lord Harimann used to be a good man, but he became rather strange in his dotage. He died some years back.</string>
  <string id="6174875">His daughter took over the family. Lady Johane Harimann. They say she's become quite reclusive of late.</string>
  <string id="6174876">Is there any peaceful way to resolve this?</string>
  <string id="6174877">What do you intend to do?</string>
  <string id="6174878">This is why the cycle of violence never gets broken...</string>
  <string id="6174879">Time for revenge?</string>
  <string id="6174880">They should pay for their crimes.</string>
  <string id="6174881">Go on the offensive.</string>
  <string id="6174889">What are you scowling about?</string>
  <string id="6174892">Heard you yelling at someone last night.</string>
  <string id="6174895">You look like you're going to kill someone.</string>
  <string id="6174898">The wife's dog ate half my blanket. I put him out on the street.</string>
  <string id="6174899">Found out our daughter's been selling herself at the Rose. Calls herself Cressida.</string>
  <string id="6174902">Cressida's your daughter? I thought she looked familiar.</string>
  <string id="6174906">The wife sold my father's sword. Said I wasn't ever going to use it and that we had mouths to feed.</string>
  <string id="6174910">What?</string>
  <string id="6174911">Who?</string>
  <string id="6174912">Where?</string>

  <string id="6174921">What in blazes... </string>
  <string id="6174925">What's the point of all this? There is no point! Life is worthless and miserable.</string>
  <string id="6174926">If you treat the Harimanns like those mercenaries, you could start a war. Go carefully, Sebastian.</string>
  <string id="6174929">You jest, but that's the truth. Give this up, Sebastian. Dedicate yourself to the Chantry, as you swore.</string>
  <string id="6174932">Unless I understand why they did this, any revenge I take will be hollow.</string>
  <string id="6174935">I must speak with Lady Harimann and find out what drove her to this madness.</string>
  <string id="6174938">But I am the last of my line. I should not go alone and make myself a target.</string>
  <string id="6174945">There's no food here. I want to go home.</string>
  <string id="6174946">Where's Puddles? He should get some food, too.</string>

  <string id="6174958">I can't sleep. Templars yell in my dreams.</string>

  <string id="6174982">The Maker's a cruel bastard.</string>
  <string id="6174983">Oh. This is about your son? Sorry to hear about that. I hope the guards find the men who did it.</string>

  <string id="6175003">If this allows Sebastian to make peace, it is worth doing. You've taken on lesser causes.</string>
  <string id="6175006">Please. I have no one else to turn to.</string>
  <string id="6175012">Fine. But don't think you're my top priority.</string>
  <string id="6175013">You're not subtle.</string>

  <string id="6175885">Kill Castillon</string>
  <string id="6175886">Free Castillon</string>
  <string id="6175887">Free Castillon</string>
  <string id="6175890">Coward. Doesn't even have the balls to own up to his own depravity.</string>
  <string id="6175893">First smart thing he's said. Give him what he wants.</string>
  <string id="6175903">A wise precaution, but the Qunari can't be above our laws forever.</string>
  <string id="6175906">As you say, Guard-Captain.</string>
  <string id="6175909">They say the Arishok respects you, and it doesn't hurt that you travel with the captain. Your word on this would be respected.</string>
  <string id="6175910">Requisition whatever you need, Guardsman. I have confidence in you.</string>
  <string id="6175922">I learn new things about you every day.</string>
  <string id="6175937">Step it up, shit for shanks. I've got elves working harder than you.</string>
  <string id="6175940">Good work, break-back. There's a bonus if we get through our manifest early.</string>
  <string id="6175943">I want these crates cleared! You know how the Orlesians are about their bloody schedules!</string>
  <string id="6175946">Does faster mean something different to you? I'm not up on my useful to idiot translation.</string>
  <string id="6175949">Just keep the ships coming, and we'll get them through.</string>
  <string id="6175950">Stacking as fast as I can. Don't you worry.</string>
  <string id="6175952">It'd take five Fereldans or ten elves to do my work, and you know it.</string>
  <string id="6175953">Save it for your missus, boss. The work is getting done.</string>
  <string id="6175957">Ready to set out, sailor? We've got you loaded.</string>
  <string id="6175960">Looks like you had rough seas. Hope you've better sailing where you're bound.</string>
  <string id="6175963">Overseer was pissed at the state of your cargo, but we've got it secure now.</string>
  <string id="6175966">The sooner I'm out of this grey hole, the better.</string>
  <string id="6175967">Face to the crates, dock-monkey. I won't be here long enough to make friends.</string>
  <string id="6175968">Good on you, friend. Wouldn't be nothing to ship without you dockside.</string>
  <string id="6175972">Captain's going crazy. Just tell me we're ready for the tide.</string>
  <string id="6175975">Fine city you have here. Not like I heard at all.</string>
  <string id="6175978">Where does a person get decent food in this hole?</string>
  <string id="6175981">Ah, get your ship out of here. It's stinking up my dock.</string>
  <string id="6175982">That's what I like about the docks. The pleasant people you meet.</string>
  <string id="6175983">No worries, woman. You'll be rags to the wind soon enough.</string>
  <string id="6175990">No work for you here, Fereldan. You're not taking my job.</string>
  <string id="6175994">Looking to hire solid labor? Getting tired of the docks, myself.</string>
  <string id="6175998">The Champion don't haul no crates. Get out of here.</string>
  <string id="6175999">The Champion down here? Not bloody likely</string>
  <string id="6176003">Load, unload. Load, unload.</string>
  <string id="6176004">Backbone of the city, and all we get is shit from Hightown.</string>
  <string id="6176005">If I get one more Orlesian bitching about cheese in the warehouse...</string>
  <string id="6176006">You want to see real work, this is where you come.</string>
  <string id="6176008">This is how your world ends!</string>
  <string id="6176012">Are we going to go that way? I've never seen a huge dragon before!</string>
  <string id="6176015">Good, so I'm not the only one who thinks this smells like a setup.</string>
  <string id="6176018">Don't be afraid, da'len. Everything's going to be all right now.</string>
  <string id="6176021">There are a lot of cruel people out there, princess. Completely demon-free.</string>
  <string id="6176024">Unfortunately, I think he has total confidence in the law. That's the problem.</string>
  <string id="6176027">Hawke, there's no magistrate in Kirkwall who'll punish a human for crimes against elves.</string>
  <string id="6176029">You still haven't. If you're looking at him in daylight, he's not a lord anymore.</string>
  <string id="6176035">Blessed are those who trade in sweat and honest labor.</string>
  <string id="6176038">Know that even in this low place, the Chant of Light finds purchase.</string>
  <string id="6176041">The Maker doesn't like you ogling my robes, shitheel.</string>
  <string id="6176044">Coughs Sorry, Sister...</string>
  <string id="6176065">Can't you put a good word in for me? With the overseer?</string>
  <string id="6176068">I could do your job. Don't think I couldn't!</string>
  <string id="6176071">Please, for an old friend? I need the work.</string>
  <string id="6176074">Piss off.</string>
  <string id="6176075">Take a long walk on a short pier.</string>
  <string id="6176076">Sorry. I really am.</string>
  <string id="6176095">Mind yourself. Your kind always have the stink of the heretical about you.</string>
  <string id="6176098">Watching you, elf. With the eyes of the Maker.</string>
  <string id="6176101">Just know that the Gallows is not far.</string>
  <string id="6176110">They hire filth like you and not a native daughter?</string>
  <string id="6176113">Can't believe I starve while an elf works the docks.</string>
  <string id="6176116">Work hard. They'll drop you in a second.</string>
  <string id="6176119">I work, shem. That's all they need to know about me.</string>
  <string id="6176120">Right now, I'd trade this job for somewhere quiet.</string>
  <string id="6176121">Would a few coins shut you up? Might be worth a few hours work.</string>
  <string id="6176122">Orzammar politics. Couldn't the city just be under siege? It would end better.</string>
  <string id="6176125">Harrowmont's not a popular king. Not in Orzammar, and even less on the surface. </string>
  <string id="6176128">If the viscount sides with him, the Merchants Guild will have him killed.</string>
  <string id="6176131">Ignore him, and Orzammar will cut off lyrium trade to Kirkwall. How long before the templars come knocking, then?</string>
  <string id="6176136">Qunari reactivity.</string>
  <string id="6176137">Qunari reactivity.</string>
  <string id="6176138">Did the Arishok greatly respect the PC in Act 2?</string>
  <string id="6176139">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6176140">Yes.</string>
  <string id="6176147">No.</string>
  <string id="6176148">No.</string>
  <string id="6176149">Mage</string>
  <string id="6176158">Nice chin, boy. That'd tickle the tenders.</string>
  <string id="6176161">Not a chance in the Void.</string>
  <string id="6176165">Pretty deep and dark for your tastes, isn't this, Varric?</string>
  <string id="6176168">Friends everywhere. Lovely.</string>
  <string id="6176169">Watch yourself, dwarf.</string>
  <string id="6176172">Your mother says hello. And, Mmm, harder.</string>
  <string id="6176173">Every lovely nugget of charm rides the sluice to Darktown.</string>
  <string id="6176177">All chin and chest. Bet you're a cuddler, though.</string>

  <string id="6176200">I've never seen a horse or halla in Kirkwall. Why's she wearing chaps?</string>
  <string id="6176203">It's a window to her world, fellas. A window to her world!</string>
  <string id="6176204">When are we taking the greenhorn to the Rose?</string>
  <string id="6176207">Ever seen the women in the Rose show their full glory, elf?</string>
  <string id="6176210">We really need this knife-ear tagging along to the Rose?</string>
  <string id="6176213">I don't know, is your mother working?</string>
  <string id="6176216">I've no interest in seeing anyone nude with you present.</string>
  <string id="6176219">You two go ahead. I don't want to make a small man look smaller.</string>
  <string id="6176222">One up on you, I'll give him that.</string>
  <string id="6176223">He's quick with the wit, isn't he?</string>
  <string id="6176224">Bit of a shit, this one.</string>

  <string id="6176288">Aren't you someone? I haven't been here long.</string>
  <string id="6176289">Word of you is getting around. I heard something about a Champion as far as Jader.</string>
  <string id="6176293">Got a look to you. You sail much?</string>
  <string id="6176296">I know your face. The boys in Orlais named an itch after you.</string>
  <string id="6176299">You remind me of someone the captain won't shut his fool mouth about.</string>
  <string id="6176302">We'll talk later, don't you worry.</string>
  <string id="6176303">You're thinking of someone else, o' maid of the brine.</string>
  <string id="6176304">A sneer on your lip, but want in your eye.</string>
  <string id="6176308">You're Fereldan, aren't you? Seems like there's more here than in Denerim.</string>
  <string id="6176309">You from the South? Got that wide-eyed look to you.</string>
  <string id="6176310">Fereldan, ain't you? Mutts of the coast, seems like.</string>
  <string id="6176313">Just waiting on a good ship, and I'm back on the waves.</string>
  <string id="6176314">Lost a load of nugs once. Maker, the stench of it.</string>
  <string id="6176316">Bound for Orlais, next. The further the better.</string>
  <string id="6176317">Tranquil</string>
  <string id="6176319">Mage</string>

  <string id="6176424">You look like a sinker. Dense.</string>
  <string id="6176427">Thanks, but no thanks.</string>
  <string id="6176428">Laughs Yes, good day to you.</string>
  <string id="6176429">Never going near a ship again.</string>
  <string id="6176457">Gift debug</string>
  <string id="6176458">Gift debug</string>
  <string id="6176459">Which gift would you like to have?</string>
  <string id="6176460">Tevinter Chantry Amulet</string>
  <string id="6176461">Tevinter Chantry Amulet</string>
  <string id="6176462">The Key to my family's basement</string>
  <string id="6176463">The Key</string>
  <string id="6176464">Anything else?</string>
  <string id="6176465">The Key to Your Heart</string>
  <string id="6176466">Anders might be interested in the key that opens the Hawke Estate through a Darktown entrance. Talk to him at his clinic.</string>
  <string id="6176467">Anders was given a key to get into the Hawke Estate.</string>
  <string id="6176471">Never get the stink of that Fereldan ship off me. It's like it was steeped in offal.</string>
  <string id="6176472">Maker, you'd think Orlesian ships need banners to be seaworthy.</string>
  <string id="6176473">Never seen the like of that qunari ship, and that was just the wreckage.</string>
  <string id="6176476">Yes, you keep going on about that. Have you seen or heard nothing else in your life?</string>
  <string id="6176477">Yes! I thought I was the only one, but you know it, too!</string>
  <string id="6176478">I've never seen one of those. I was... not allowed out.</string>
  <string id="6176481">Well, look who thinks his opinions matter.</string>
  <string id="6176482">You'll see it all on this job. No secrets on the docks.</string>
  <string id="6176483">Shut up, you two. I'm not loading all of this while you jabber.</string>
  <string id="6176486">So, I got this one. What's black and blue and scares the empress?</string>
  <string id="6176489">All right, I've got one. A sister, a templar, and a courtesan walk into the Hanged Man.</string>
  <string id="6176492">And then I ask him, what's the difference between Orlais and an elven ass?</string>
  <string id="6176495">Four bits and ten, same as in town!</string>
  <string id="6176498">Denerim? Damn near killed him!</string>
  <string id="6176501">And when I woke up, my halla was gone!</string>
  <string id="6176504">I don't get it.</string>
  <string id="6176507">Laughs</string>
  <string id="6176510">Were you... a breech birth?</string>
  <string id="6176513">He ruined it. You ruined it, you ass.</string>
  <string id="6176514">He's right, just let me tell it.</string>
  <string id="6176515">You just can't let me tell it, can you? You have to be that guy?</string>
  <string id="6176522">You're sure you don't want a little extra for your retirement fund, Captain?</string>
  <string id="6176525">That stopped with Jeven, as did your extra shipments.</string>
  <string id="6176528">Can't fault a man for asking.</string>
  <string id="6176531">I can, and I have.</string>
  <string id="6176547">Don't need more of you around, thanks. Go scratch somewhere else.</string>
  <string id="6176548">Don't trust the help I have, sure don't like the look of you.</string>
  <string id="6176549">Stay off my dock unless you've got a ticket home, Fereldan.</string>
  <string id="6176556">You've got some coin to you. You bring in a ship, we'll treat her right.</string>
  <string id="6176557">I ain't prettying up the place, no matter how rich you look.</string>
  <string id="6176568">What's the Champion doing down the docks? Not a good sign.</string>
  <string id="6176569">Orlesians lost a ship up the coast. Qunari, they say.</string>
  <string id="6176570">No viscount, no damned treaties! How are we supposed to make a profit?</string>
  <string id="6176573">Stay off the docks. My men work. They don't talk.</string>
  <string id="6176575">No work, no pay. So simple, the elves get it.</string>
  <string id="6176576">These docks are run tighter than the ships we load.</string>
  <string id="6176580">Strong back on you. Can you lift, and are you cheap?</string>
  <string id="6176583">Yes and no, so piss off.</string>
  <string id="6176592">Lady Elegant</string>
  <string id="6176594">Commoner</string>
  <string id="6176596">Commoner</string>
  <string id="6176598">Mage</string>
  <string id="6176604">Fine. Starve.</string>
  <string id="6176611">I hear someone very near to your description may be important in certain circles.</string>
  <string id="6176614">Business as usual, serah. Trust in us.</string>
  <string id="6176618">Business is slow, thanks to some jackass shutting down the Coterie.</string>
  <string id="6176621">Not that I ever worked with them, of course.</string>
  <string id="6176624">I sure hope Constable Brennicovick makes it to retirement. He's too old for that shit.</string>
  <string id="6176625">Barks</string>
  <string id="6176628">Barks</string>
  <string id="6176631">Barks</string>
  <string id="6176639">Not my favorite stop, I'll tell you that, Fereldan.</string>
  <string id="6176640">Captain finds a Fereldan on board, over they go, no questions.</string>
  <string id="6176647">Did you... board us once? Woman, you left us drifting!</string>
  <string id="6176650">Could have sworn I knew a girl like you out of Rivain.</string>
  <string id="6176653">There's a scourge on the waves, sometimes scarlet, sometimes satin. Know her at your peril.</string>
  <string id="6176656">I'm sorry, I don't speak never-gets-sex-again.</string>
  <string id="6176657">Yes, good times, wasn't it? Keep walking, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6176658">I don't know you, you don't know me. </string>
  <string id="6176659">A rich Fereldan? Still a shadow of Val Royeaux, but impressive for here.</string>
  <string id="6176660">Heard something about a big strike in the Deep Roads. Always hearing things like that.</string>
  <string id="6176664">The Champion! Well that's the strangest thing.</string>
  <string id="6176666">Some of us avoid Kirkwall. Too many templars in your business.</string>
  <string id="6176667">We don't sail up near Rivain. Rumor of more Qunari, and that's good enough for me.</string>
  <string id="6176670">Kirkwall ain't what it used to be. That's good for some, I guess.</string>
  <string id="6176672">Will be glad to be back on the waves.</string>
  <string id="6176673">Hate solid ground. Rather get planked than grounded.</string>
  <string id="6176674">If the best thing you can say is that the Blight didn't get here, it's a crap hole.</string>
  <string id="6176719">You know what we face. The mages in there, they have risked everything. All of us!</string>
  <string id="6176722">That's not a danger I can ignore. You want peace in Kirkwall? This is where we create it!</string>
  <string id="6176725">We didn't want this. The mages, they're our brothers and sisters. It's sad, but still necessary.</string>
  <string id="6176728">Kirkwall needs us to set this right. We need order, or we lose ourselves.</string>
  <string id="6176731">I'm no templar. I'm not sure every step leads me closer to the Maker. But I know trouble, and this is it.</string>
  <string id="6176734">I can't say for certain that going in there is right, but I know it's needed right now.</string>
  <string id="6176737">You know what the templars believe. What they're afraid of. But that's their burden, not ours.</string>
  <string id="6176740">They are not taking the life I built. They don't get to decide how this ends. We do!</string>
  <string id="6176743">We're cornered. The templars know it. You know it. But this is bigger than their hate... their fear.</string>
  <string id="6176746">They've come to take your lives, and we are saying no. We didn't want this, but sometimes... </string>
  <string id="6176749">So, this is it. Some of you are worried. Maybe I am too, but I'm not staying long enough to find out.</string>
  <string id="6176752">What I know is that I don't like being cornered, and I can fight harder scared than they can angry.</string>
  <string id="6176755">We're getting out, and I'm buying when we do.</string>
  <string id="6176796">I'll be leaving.</string>
  <string id="6176797">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="6177010">...hard to believe they left me nothing.</string>
  <string id="6177013">Well, Mother was pretty steamed when you ran off with your Fereldan apostate.</string>
  <string id="6177016">I'm still their daughter. Their eldest!</string>
  <string id="6177129">That's strange. The door's wide open.</string>
  <string id="6177132">And not a single guard posted.</string>
  <string id="6177136">It's been three days. This waiting has to end.</string>
  <string id="6177184">Are mages like Anders so dangerous? He's given no reason to fear him yet.</string>
  <string id="6177185">Anders is that fearsome?</string>
  <string id="6177186">Is a mage like Bethany so threatening? I don't see it.</string>
  <string id="6177187">Bethany is dangerous?</string>
  <string id="6177188">I find it hard to believe that Merrill could be so threatening.</string>
  <string id="6177189">Are you afraid of Merrill?</string>
  <string id="6177295">There is something very wrong in here.</string>
  <string id="6177296">I visited this house often as a child. They could not have concealed such goings-on.</string>
  <string id="6177300">Demons. Temptresses.</string>
  <string id="6177303">We must see what greater evil they were protecting.</string>
  <string id="6177304">A ruin? So close to Hightown? I remember no such thing.</string>
  <string id="6177305">In the shadows! More of them!</string>
  <string id="6177319">When home is on the line, maybe that's enough.</string>
  <string id="6177322">Sometimes you just have to stand.</string>
  <string id="6177330">You clear the route up the Wounded Coast, and I... will live to regret this, I'm sure.</string>
  <string id="6177331">You clear the route up the Wounded Coast, and I... will think of something to say.</string>
  <string id="6177332">Isabela's Regret</string>
  <string id="6177333">Isabela has resurfaced after years. Speak to her in Lowtown's Hanged Man pub, where she's been seen drinking.</string>
  <string id="6177341">If you passed that to Captain Jeven, I doubt anything was done with it.</string>
  <string id="6177343">Martin lost his stolen cargo.</string>
  <string id="6177350">The elven apostates were killed.</string>
  <string id="6177436">Help Gamlen search for your mother in Lowtown, or ask Gascard DuPuis if he's learned anything new.</string>
  <string id="6177439">Apostate</string>
  <string id="6177451">Kill him, and you become him.</string>

  <string id="6177633">Dear FirstName/&gt;,&#13;
&#13;
I hope this letter finds you well. My time in the Circle has been bearable, even after the templars made a point of putting me through the Harrowing as soon as I arrived. They thought I was at risk of possession or running away like Father. Glad it's over with. &#13;
&#13;
I've started mentoring apprentices. I enjoy time with the children, teaching them basic spells. One of them, Ella, has taken a shine to me. Adorable!&#13;
&#13;
Life's not perfect here, mind you. The templars are mostly polite, and I know they're just doing their jobs, but some hold extreme views. There's one creep named Ser Alrik who likes harassing mages, but I'll steer clear of him! &#13;
&#13;
I'm doing fine! Please don't worry about me.&#13;
&#13;
With love,&#13;
Bethany</string>
  <string id="6177634">FirstName/&gt;,&#13;
&#13;
So it's official: I'm a Grey Warden. Stroud says I'm lucky that the Warden's ritual has kept the taint at bay. Not sure if I'd call it luck, but I'm alive.&#13;
&#13;
It's been brutal, going through this. I have awful nightmares. I close my eyes and hear whispering. Is it real, or am I going mad? I'll survive that, too. That's my life is now: survival, getting through each day. That's what you wanted, isn't it?&#13;
&#13;
Tell Mother I miss her.&#13;
&#13;
With love,&#13;
Bethany</string>
  <string id="6177635">Dear FirstName/&gt;,&#13;
&#13;
How are you? I hope you and Mother are doing well. Things are good here. I've found my place among the templars. It's nice to have purpose, to be part of something bigger than myself... and you! All right, all right, I'll stop being a pain in the ass.&#13;
 &#13;
It's not a perfect job, though. I don't really like what we do to mages, but do we have a choice? It keeps everyone safe, and it's better than the alternative. Many mages understand that we're trying to help, even if our methods could use improvement. &#13;
&#13;
Unfortunately, there are extreme elements within the Order. Some argue for a permanent solution and have ideas I hope never take root. Makes me glad Bethany never had to live in a place like this.&#13;
&#13;
I'll wrap this up. Duty calls. Send my love to Mother.&#13;
&#13;
Your brother,&#13;
Carver</string>
  <string id="6177636">FirstName/&gt;,&#13;
&#13;
How are you? Hope all is well. Things are good here, I suppose. Grey Warden legends do fail to mention a few things, though! I've yet to do anything remotely glorious or honorable since arriving. In fact, most of it is painful, dirty, often horrific work. Thanks a lot! (In case you forgot that it's your fault I'm here.)&#13;
&#13;
The positive is that I'm alive and part of something greater. I've a chance to prove myself. Maybe I'll even step out of your big fat shadow! Thing is, Ferelden already has a hero that stopped the Blight. Pfft! Big deal, right?&#13;
&#13;
Say hello to Mother and Gamlen for me.&#13;

  <string id="6177811">I had hoped prayer might cleanse me of the desire demon's touch.</string>
  <string id="6177814">But I still hear her voice so clearly. I feel like I've bathed in filth that will never come off.</string>
  <string id="6177815">You acted honorably. Why are you ashamed?</string>
  <string id="6177816">You did nothing wrong.</string>
  <string id="6177817">Wash behind the ears. Evil usually gets stuck there.</string>
  <string id="6177818">You just need to scrub.</string>
  <string id="6177819">The Harimanns won't stand against you. Will you ride back to Starkhaven now?</string>
  <string id="6177820">You have what you need.</string>
  <string id="6177827">You were looking for this?</string>
  <string id="6177829">Here, you were looking for this.</string>
  <string id="6177830">I heard you lost something. This it?</string>
  <string id="6177831">You were whining about losing something?</string>
  <string id="6177832">This is yours. Try to keep track of your things.</string>
  <string id="6177835">Your lost garbage, serah.</string>
  <string id="6177840">I think I found something of yours.</string>
  <string id="6177841">This is yours, if I'm not mistaken.</string>
  <string id="6177843">I believe you lost this somewhere?</string>
  <string id="6177844">You were looking for this, I believe.</string>
  <string id="6177845">Something of yours, serah.</string>
  <string id="6177849">Did you misplace this?</string>
  <string id="6177853">I think you let this get away from you.</string>
  <string id="6177854">Check your purse—I think you lost something.</string>
  <string id="6177857">A little something of yours I picked up somewhere.</string>
  <string id="6177859">This fell into my hands. Recognize it?</string>
  <string id="6177860">It's probably nothing, but are you missing this incredibly important thing?</string>
  <string id="6177861">Look what I found—your reason for living.</string>
  <string id="6177882">I don't know. Flora said others are still vying for the title. I should find out who before I charge in blindly.</string>
  <string id="6177885">In truth, I can't feel as righteous as I did before.</string>
  <string id="6177888">I keep asking myself, Do I want this because it's right, or simply to have what I never thought I could?</string>
  <string id="6177889">Aren't you your parents' heir? </string>
  <string id="6177890">Never thought you could?</string>
  <string id="6177891">I'm the youngest son of three.</string>
  <string id="6177894">My parents were... rather traditional. They wanted the heir and the spare, and I was left in the cold.</string>
  <string id="6177897">They put me in the Chantry to prevent my competing with my brothers.</string>
  <string id="6177898">You seem very dedicated to the Chantry. You were put there against your will?</string>
  <string id="6177899">You didn't join by choice?</string>
  <string id="6177900">At first. But it was the best thing that could have happened.</string>
  <string id="6177903">I was a wild boy, a shame to my family. The Chantry made me a man.</string>
  <string id="6177906">It's odd. When I wanted to rule, I would have been terrible at it. Now that I might be decent, I don't know if it's the right thing to do.</string>
  <string id="6177907">It's the wisdom not to want power that lets you use it wisely.</string>
  <string id="6177908">Listen to your heart.</string>
  <string id="6177909">You must do what you think is right, Sebastian.</string>
  <string id="6177910">What do you want to do?</string>
  <string id="6177911">Do you have an answer?</string>
  <string id="6177912">That's a good question.</string>
  <string id="6177913">Don't let the demon make you doubt yourself.</string>
  <string id="6177914">You must take back your land.</string>
  <string id="6177915">In trying to retake Starkhaven, I have already brought death to so many.</string>
  <string id="6177918">Could I ever do enough good as prince to justify that?</string>
  <string id="6177919">You could be a just and fair ruler. Worry about reparations once you take your lands.</string>
  <string id="6177920">You'll be a great prince.</string>
  <string id="6177921">Real princes don't worry about who they step on on their way to the top.</string>
  <string id="6177922">Can't make an omelette...</string>
  <string id="6177923">Would you stand aside and let someone else claim what your family fought and died for?</string>
  <string id="6177924">It is your birthright.</string>
  <string id="6177937">If you've need of something a little more exotic, come to me.</string>
  <string id="6177940">Just remember: quality like this comes at a price.</string>
  <string id="6177943">Feel free to look at my merchandise... if you've the coin.</string>
  <string id="6177944">In the market for something special, friend?</string>
  <string id="6177945">I'm sure you'll see that everything is worth the impressive prices.</string>
  <string id="6177949">Just don't ask where anything came from.</string>
  <string id="6177950">Ah! I see someone with an eye for fine merchandise!</string>
  <string id="6177951">Let's see if we can't find something to interest you, messere.</string>
  <string id="6177952">You won't regret any purchase you make here. Trust me.</string>

  <string id="6178332">The demon didn't lie. I used to be bitterly jealous of my brother. I wanted to be prince.</string>
  <string id="6178335">Now, everything he had is mine. And he lies in ashes.</string>
  <string id="6178338">You didn't feel what that demon stirred in me.</string>
  <string id="6178341">No.</string>
  <string id="6178344">It cannot be right to lead any army to Starkhaven with such doubt in my heart.</string>
  <string id="6178347">I owe you more than I can say, Hawke. I will offer my service to you here before I move on.</string>
  <string id="6178348">If you want to help me, do it because we're friends. There's no debt between us.</string>
  <string id="6178349">You owe me nothing.</string>
  <string id="6178350">You have a good soul, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6178353">It was truly the Maker who led you to me.</string>
  <string id="6178354">Killing a few hundred more bandits ought to help you make up your mind.</string>
  <string id="6178355">Sounds fun!</string>
  <string id="6178356">Laughs You do have a unique way of working out your inner struggles, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6178359">Enough of this. I will make no decision today.</string>
  <string id="6178360">You swore an oath to serve the Chantry. It's not right to turn your back.</string>
  <string id="6178361">You should honor your vows.</string>
  <string id="6178362">Andraste herself said the highest grace is to honor our parents. Our first loyalty is to our roots.</string>
  <string id="6178365">It is not so simple a decision.</string>
  <string id="6178366">I can think of a few services for you to perform...</string>
  <string id="6178367">Your service, huh?</string>
  <string id="6178368">What? Why are you smiling like...?</string>
  <string id="6178371">Oh. Oh, my. That's... not what I meant. I...</string>
  <string id="6178374">I think I need to pray. A lot.</string>
  <string id="6178375">I know you've done great things in Kirkwall, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6178378">I imagine your methods haven't always been scrupulous, but you clearly do more good than harm.</string>
  <string id="6178381">I just don't know if I can follow that road.</string>
  <string id="6178388">I... I had never thought to see this again. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6178389">You found this? I don't know what to say.</string>
  <string id="6178392">I didn't expect to see this again. Thank you. Truly.</string>
  <string id="6178394">How did you...? No, I don't want to know. Just, thank you.</string>
  <string id="6178395">This couldn't come at a better time. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6178396">You surprise me. I didn't think that was possible anymore.</string>

  <string id="6178423">You brought it home? I am... right stunned, actually.</string>
  <string id="6178425">You brought me what? Maker, that's... wonderful.</string>
  <string id="6178426">I don't know if I am comfortable even holding it, but... truly, thank you.</string>
  <string id="6178428">What do you mean bringing me that? I mean, I'm amazed!</string>
  <string id="6178429">How did you get that? No... I really don't want to know.</string>
  <string id="6178434">You just stumbled on this? Can't say I'm surprised. Bloody fools.</string>
  <string id="6178435">I had long since paid my debt over this. It's grand to see it again.</string>
  <string id="6178436">An old, foolish thing to need. Thank you for saving me the trip.</string>
  <string id="6178437">Simple as that? Just a walk and drop? Amazing.</string>
  <string id="6178439">Well, isn't that a sight for sun-blind eyes? Thank you more than kindly.</string>
  <string id="6178440">Who'd have thought that would show up again? Wonder of wonders.</string>
  <string id="6178447">A strange turn. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6178448">Ma serannas. This is a rare gesture.</string>
  <string id="6178449">You did this? Without being begged and thrice paid? Interesting.</string>
  <string id="6178452">I thought this was lost to us—like so many other things. My gratitude.</string>
  <string id="6178453">You have done a great kindness in returning this.</string>
  <string id="6178454">I thought this was lost. Perhaps it should be, but that does not diminish your kindness.</string>
  <string id="6178459">Hello again, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6178462">I cannot fault Sebastian for wanting to know why an old ally would turn against his parents.</string>
  <string id="6178465">But I fear he's too impetuous. He may do something he regrets.</string>
  <string id="6178468">Please, go with him, try to restrain him. If the Harimanns are guilty, they will receive justice from the viscount.</string>
  <string id="6178471">Sebastian need not take their punishment into his own hands.</string>
  <string id="6178482">Shh! I can't accurately express my gratitude, but thank you.</string>
  <string id="6178484">Where did you get this? It's... just what I need. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6178485">You found it? By the Void I didn't think... thank you.</string>
  <string id="6178486">Thank the Maker and various others! I need to lock this up.</string>
  <string id="6178487">This was free of its handler? Well, you're a lucky one. Thank you.</string>
  <string id="6178489">Don't wave that around! I mean: thank you for this perfectly normal item.</string>
  <string id="6178491">Hurlock</string>
  <string id="6178493">A demon behind the attack on Sebastian's family! Truly, whatever has happened in Kirkwall has thinned the Veil.</string>
  <string id="6178496">I must pray to Andraste for guidance.</string>
  <string id="6178498">From Alain</string>
  <string id="6178507">To Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
Remember me? You saved me from Decimus some time ago. I thought you'd like to know that Grace was finally apprehended. She seemed bitter when I spoke to her, wishing she'd been killed instead of captured.&#13;
&#13;
The Kirkwall Circle is much stricter than Starkhaven's, but I'm getting used to it. And I'm glad to be alive!&#13;
&#13;
Thank you for everything,&#13;
Alain</string>
  <string id="6178508">To Hawke,&#13;
&#13;
You may not remember, but you saved me from Decimus some time ago. Grace and I went with Thrask to Kirkwall. The Circle here is stricter than the one in Starkhaven, but I'm getting used to it. I'm glad to be alive. Grace isn't adjusting as well, but I think she'll come around.&#13;

&#13;
Or is it now Champion Hawke? The story of how you handled the Arishok is very popular here. There are few things the Tevinters love more than a tale of Qunari defeat!&#13;
&#13;
To say the Imperium is a strange place would be a vast understatement. Men and women work magic in the streets while their slaves look on. I watched my own master kill a rival magister in a duel just days ago. Sometimes I look around and think I understand the templars back in Kirkwall.&#13;
&#13;
My studies are going well. My dreams don't trouble me as much these days. I'm hopeful that, in time, I'll master myself. I just wanted to thank you. I owe you more than my life. I owe you my mind and my future.&#13;

It is I, Macha, Keran's sister. I'm writing to tell you that we are well, all things considered. It's hard getting by without Keran's templar allowance, but we manage. He's been unhappy about leaving the Order, but at least he's safe and alive.&#13;

Life with the Dalish hasn't been easy. Keeper Marethari tries her best, but I don't know what else she can do for me. The younger elves won't accept me, and I often hear them whispering behind my back. The elders have more discretion, but I can see it in their eyes—they're afraid of me.&#13;
&#13;
I don't know why I'm telling you this. Sometimes it feels like you're the only person I can trust.&#13;

It's been years, and the Circle has yet to find a way to help me. I've seen the way the templars look at me. I know they want me to undergo the Rite of Tranquility. If something doesn't change soon, they will force it upon me.&#13;
&#13;
I try to keep myself under control, but it's difficult. The nightmares are coming more frequently. They seem so real. I can't help thinking that the Dalish would've had an answer for this.&#13;

In case you don't remember me, we met in the Gallows a few years ago. You saved my life. Twice, in fact. Once from Ser Alrik, and once from... someone else.&#13;
&#13;
It's not the kindest thing to say, but nobody misses Alrik. Not even the other templars. I know it's hard to imagine, but they don't want to fight. They want things to be normal: no Harrowings, no Tranquil, and no one dying. But none of us are getting that wish now.&#13;

You rescued me from Ser Alrik, and you told me to leave Kirkwall. I wanted to tell you that I have. I won't say where I am now, but I'm free, and I'm not looking back.&#13;

  <string id="6178996">Dear FirstName/&gt;,&#13;
&#13;
I assume Gamlen's told you nothing about me. I ask after you every time I visit him, and all I get is, You've heard it all from the town criers. Dear old dad.&#13;
&#13;
I hope this letter finds you well. I hear stories, but I can't tell what's true and what's exaggerated. Did you really fistfight the Qunari leader? Are you actually sleeping with the captain of the city guard? Did you slay a dragon in Darktown? It can't all be true!&#13;
&#13;
It is exciting to hear the stories and say, That's my cousin! Write to me, and tell me how you've been. I want news! I'll trade you incriminating gossip about your favorite uncle.&#13;

&#13;
Things are slowly getting back to normal in most of the country, but Lothering is gone for good. We hoped to rebuild there, but the Blight poisoned the land. It'll take decades for the earth to recover. It may never.&#13;
&#13;
Redcliffe is a nice place, and I'm starting to see it as home. The village saw some trouble during the Blight, but it's recovering. Perhaps you could visit sometime.&#13;

I'm so sorry. I don't know what happened to Tamra. I think her family fled to Redcliffe, but I haven't been able to locate them. I don't have much hope left, but miracles can happen. I will keep trying. I know Tamra was a close friend. I will write you as soon as I hear something.&#13;

&#13;
We're not going back to Lothering. I hear the land is poisoned or something. Father is raising money for a new farm in the Bannorn. I don't know when that'll happen, but he's working very hard. We're living with my aunt in Denerim, so please send your letters there.&#13;
&#13;
Why haven't you been writing, Carver? Did you find another girl in the Free Marches? Remember: no girl will ever do what I did for you behind Barlin's shed that time. You just think about that!&#13;

&#13;
Did he find a girl in Kirkwall? Please say he didn't. I think that would break my heart. I always thought he liked me, but I don't know why nothing ever came of it.

  <string id="6179040">Dear Sir or Madam,&#13;
&#13;
I am Lord Achim Falk of Starkhaven. I have faith in the Maker and Andraste, his beloved prophet, that I must bring this matter of urgent business to you. Years ago, I served the office of Seneschal to the royal family of Starkhaven. Sadly, they have been deposed, ousted by a foul usurper. I represent His Royal Highness, Prince Corbinian Vael, the true heir to the throne, and with your help, Maker willing, we will see him wear the crown of Starkhaven once more.&#13;
&#13;
His Highness had a fortune of eleven thousand sovereigns locked away in the vaults of the Royal Bank of Antiva. With access to this fortune, he can raise an army to retake the throne, but it is too dangerous for His Highness to simply withdraw the funds himself. This is where we require your assistance and discretion.&#13;
&#13;
Simply send me the details of an open bank account in Kirkwall, and I will arrange that the funds are transferred to you. My King will then contact you to retrieve his fortune, leaving you with a hefty award. I must warn you, the Antivans will not consider the account viable if it contains less than 100 sovereigns. Please observe the utmost confidentiality.&#13;
&#13;
Yours,&#13;
Lord Achim Falk</string>
  <string id="6179044">Well, what does this do, I wonder?</string>
  <string id="6179045">Something begging for a careless hand.</string>
  <string id="6179046">Something of interest... if I want to risk messing with it.</string>
  <string id="6179047">Looks like this would do something if I give it the right care.</string>
  <string id="6179050">I'll check it out.</string>
  <string id="6179052">All right, let's see what this gets me.</string>
  <string id="6179053">Right, here we go.</string>
  <string id="6179054">Let's see what surprises this holds, hmm?</string>
  <string id="6179057">Leave it be.</string>
  <string id="6179059">I'll just back away slowly.</string>
  <string id="6179060">No need to look for extra trouble.</string>
  <string id="6179061">Not interested, thank you.</string>
  <string id="6179062">Let sleeping dogs lie. Also ancient evils.</string>
  <string id="6179069">Good job in there. In fact, get rid of any other groups like that, and I'll be at the Hanged Man with some toys as reward.</string>

  <string id="6179256">Need another latch to shut this properly!</string>
  <string id="6179260">I need more friends?</string>
  <string id="6179261">Well... how about that?</string>
  <string id="6179262">I never meet anyone normal.</string>
  <string id="6179268">Another time, friend Hawke. Many of them, hopefully.</string>
  <string id="6179269">I removed another bunch of lowlifes.</string>
  <string id="6179272">Good news. We like a calm city to play in. Enjoy.</string>
  <string id="6179298">And many are grateful, as always. I take my leave. Enjoy, Champion.</string>

  <string id="6179316">You're a real street-cleaner, Serah Hawke. Our compliments.</string>
  <string id="6179317">Good on you, Serah Hawke. We friends are indeed friends of yours.</string>
  <string id="6179326">Mistress Hawke. But what...? Are you saying you responded to my post on the Chanters' Board?</string>
  <string id="6179333">Let me know when you're ready to talk to Lady Harimann. I will pray for guidance.</string>
  <string id="6179336">This is not the Lady Harimann I remember...</string>
  <string id="6179337">I have prayed for Andraste to guide us to peace with the Harimanns.</string>
  <string id="6179371">Screams Get 'em off, get 'em off, get 'em off, get 'em off, get 'em off!</string>
  <string id="6179375">You all right, dwarf?</string>
  <string id="6179384">Saved my stones, you did. Check the stock I was dragging home. Discounts on everything, just for you.</string>
  <string id="6179387">Within reason, mind.</string>
  <string id="6179391">Long way from Ortan Thaig. Now I know what drove cousin Ruck crazy.</string>
  <string id="6179393">A strange sense led me down here. Definitely more stone than common.</string>
  <string id="6179413">The gauntlet is passed. Only a Shaperate brings the light... conversion begins...</string>
  <string id="6179418">Amgarrak tapped the blood, spilled within the Stone.</string>
  <string id="6179419">The Stone lives beneath Orlais. Mathas gar na fornen pa salroka atrast.</string>
  <string id="6179427">The great stores are open, Shaperate. Exchange for what is needed.</string>
  <string id="6179430">A rare thing. No sense in it's head and no answers, but useful.</string>
  <string id="6179431">I don't know what it is, but let's see what it's selling.</string>
  <string id="6179432">We were once more than we are.</string>
  <string id="6179433">Do you expect me to believe all that?</string>
  <string id="6179436">Chuckles</string>
  <string id="6179439">Oh? It just so happens I was there.</string>
  <string id="6179444">That's last time I take directions from Foreshadow. Doesn't know his ass from this hole in the ground.</string>
  <string id="6179452">The seals are gone. Foolish wards held by pretenders. Aspects.</string>
  <string id="6179455">The true source is missing, the power unheld. But I... command a piece.</string>
  <string id="6179456">Another demon, another delusion.</string>
  <string id="6179457">Sounds like pride to me.</string>
  <string id="6179458">You release the best of everything you have faced, but I consume it.</string>
  <string id="6179461">The true source? What do you claim to have?</string>
  <string id="6179462">You command what?</string>
  <string id="6179463">Fragments of every fool who held a throne, here or in the black.</string>
  <string id="6179466">Summoned a horror. Of course I did. Why wouldn't I do that?</string>
  <string id="6179467">Here we go again.</string>
  <string id="6179468">Horrors are pieces, slivers of greater crimes.</string>
  <string id="6179471">I am pride with reason. I enslave the whims and wyrds, the dreams from the other side of the Veil.</string>
  <string id="6179474">Face me! Face everything!</string>
  <string id="6179475">Actually, I need more time to investigate.</string>
  <string id="6179476">I changed my mind.</string>
  <string id="6179490">Hate this. Hate it! Always have, always will!</string>
  <string id="6179494">You all right?</string>
  <string id="6179497">Want the best? Take it from the worst. Then sell to specialists. Like you.</string>
  <string id="6179502">You find things, you sell things. The tricky bit is placement.</string>
  <string id="6179503">Don't ask where it comes from and you'll get the best. That's what you want, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6179506">Always willing to give a discount to the people who save my skin.</string>
  <string id="6179511">Away with you! I will not be caged again!</string>
  <string id="6179515">You are in a strange place, Fereldan.</string>
  <string id="6179518">Tell me about it.</string>
  <string id="6179521">Knowing is half the battle. And it need not be wholly unprofitable. Provided few questions are asked.</string>
  <string id="6179528">Not every coin is valued by weight. Some carry where they've been, like small whispers of the past.</string>
  <string id="6179530">Places hunger for people to find them. No matter how disagreeable the denizens.</string>
  <string id="6179557">This is getting out of hand. Can a man who knows much not know where to find rest?</string>
  <string id="6179560">Finally, the streets are safe for decent citizens and particularly ambulatory metaphors.</string>
  <string id="6179561">Rapscallions!</string>
  <string id="6179581">You are the biggest news in Kirkwall, messere. Your grandparents would be so proud.</string>
  <string id="6179589">I'm giving it all up! I made a vow to the Chantry, and it was wrong to turn my back.</string>
  <string id="6179593">I think this is yours.</string>
  <string id="6179596">My grandfather's bow! But... where did you get it?</string>
  <string id="6179599">One of the Flint Company men did some looting. I figured I'd return the favor.</string>

  <string id="6179752">Arl Foreshadow</string>
  <string id="6179758">Thank you. It's... hard to mourn the loss of a thing while my family lies dead. But I did think of it.</string>
  <string id="6179759">What's the story behind that bow?</string>
  <string id="6179760">Is the bow special?</string>
  <string id="6179761">As the youngest son, it was my place to lead Starkhaven's militia. But I never had a talent for swordplay. Too much getting hit.</string>
  <string id="6179764">My grandfather said the bow is the wise man's weapon. You can defend your city without opening its gates.</string>
  <string id="6179767">Grandfather said the day I could pull the string on his bow, it would be mine.</string>
  <string id="6179768">Then why didn't you have it with you?</string>
  <string id="6179769">So the bow is yours?</string>
  <string id="6179770">I was thirteen when my grandfather made me that promise.</string>
  <string id="6179773">I would rise at dawn to practice my shots until I could hit the eye slit of a helmet from the top of the ramparts.</string>
  <string id="6179776">But... my parents pledged me to the Chantry before I could show him.</string>
  <string id="6179777">Were you and your grandfather close?</string>
  <string id="6179778">Tell me of your grandfather.</string>
  <string id="6179779">He was a man of the world—prince of Starkhaven—but he had the most unshakable faith in the Maker.</string>
  <string id="6179782">When my parents threatened to pledge me to the Chantry, he told me he'd gladly trade his title for a life of contemplation.</string>
  <string id="6179785">The Maker ordained a place for each of us, I remember him saying. We have only to serve.</string>
  <string id="6179786">I'm sorry I never got a chance to meet them. To... save them.</string>
  <string id="6179787">I wish I could have helped.</string>
  <string id="6179788">You can't shoot your family at a charging bandit and stop him dead between the eyes.</string>
  <string id="6179789">A bow's better than a family.</string>
  <string id="6179790">Laughs Do you hold nothing sacred, Hawke?</string>
  <string id="6179793">Still, I'll stop dwelling on what can't be fixed and appreciate this gift you've found for me.</string>
  <string id="6179796">I look forward to testing it.</string>
  <string id="6179797">Think of them with every arrow you fire to retake your land.</string>
  <string id="6179798">Use it to avenge them.</string>
  <string id="6179799">I know. You're a true friend, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6179802">But if I could bring back our lowest servant by snapping it in half, I'd do it without regrets.</string>

&#13;
I must tell you of a recent event: Ser Conrad was fighting with another templar; Ser Roderick broke in and accused Ser Conrad of worshipping The Great Demon and doing demony things. The other templars were aghast. In the middle of the scene that followed, a dockworker came up and said, calm as you please, You Ser Conrad? Got a shipment of raw lyrium for you. Sign here. It took all my resolve not to burst into laughter.&#13;
&#13;
Ser Conrad was discharged from the order and is under investigation. I don't know how you did it, Hawke, but you saved a lot of apostates.&#13;

&#13;
Needless to say, Ser Conrad was whisked away and hasn't been seen since. I don't know how you did it, Hawke, but you saved a lot of apostates.&#13;
&#13;
-A friend</string>
  <string id="6179829">It's a shame we couldn't get them all, but every little thread helps. Take this.</string>
  <string id="6179854">Sebastian, listen to yourself. You're as impulsive now as the day you turned away from us.</string>
  <string id="6179857">Do you think the Maker wants another rashly-spoken vow that you'll abandon when the next passion takes you?</string>
  <string id="6179860">I will not—</string>
  <string id="6179863">This is your life, child. Don't spend it being blown about like a weathervane.</string>
  <string id="6179872">But here's Hawke. Maybe you can talk some sense into him.</string>
  <string id="6179873">Is the grand cleric upset with you?</string>
  <string id="6179874">She seems frustrated.</string>
  <string id="6179875">I don't think sense is really my strong suit.</string>
  <string id="6179876">I'm not a good choice.</string>
  <string id="6179877">Have you done something dumb again?</string>
  <string id="6179878">What's going on now?</string>
  <string id="6179879">You brought me this to remember and honor them.</string>
  <string id="6179882">Yes. This will be a fitting weapon to carry against the usurpers.</string>
  <string id="6179885">Thank you for thinking of me, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6179886">She thinks I'm fickle. But I mean it!</string>
  <string id="6179889">How long has she spent telling me to return to the Chantry? And now that I want to, she won't take me!</string>
  <string id="6179892">No. I'm finally doing something smart.</string>
  <string id="6179895">It was wrong for me to break my oath to the Chantry. I've turned against the Maker, and for what?</string>
  <string id="6179900">You belong in the Chantry.</string>
  <string id="6179905">You must take Starkhaven!</string>
  <string id="6179908">I can't believe you'd turn your back on Starkhaven now. After all we've done.</string>
  <string id="6179909">I know you don't agree, but I can't continue to break my oath. And for what?</string>
  <string id="6179912">You're wise to stay here. No one trusts a man who breaks his oath.</string>
  <string id="6179913">Maybe you're right. Princes have to do a lot of underhanded things. You might not be so good at that.</string>
  <string id="6179914">Don't give up now. You defeated the desire demons. All of Kirkwall benefited.</string>
  <string id="6179917">Of everything we've done, I'll never regret that. But I don't know.</string>
  <string id="6179922">I've been praying for guidance and had nothing.</string>
  <string id="6179925">When I think of going to Starkhaven... calling on allies like Flora Harimann and all the corrupt, scheming nobles...</string>
  <string id="6179928">My throat swells shut in horror. When I think about staying, I'm at peace.</string>
  <string id="6179940">And here's Hawke. Come to goad you into further heroics, no doubt.</string>
  <string id="6179941">I don't have to goad anyone. They follow me for my natural charm.</string>
  <string id="6179942">What does she mean goad?</string>
  <string id="6179947">I thought you would try to talk me out of this, Hawke. Thank you for understanding.</string>
  <string id="6179953">Why would I want to rule Starkhaven and deal with jackals like Lady Harimann for the rest of my life?</string>
  <string id="6179972">Power and money?</string>
  <string id="6179973">Do you see yourself as a prince or a priest?</string>
  <string id="6179974">What do you want to do?</string>
  <string id="6179975">That's exactly the question I've been praying for guidance about.</string>
  <string id="6179978">If you give it up, what then?</string>
  <string id="6179979">What will you do now?</string>
  <string id="6179980">I suppose I must convince Elthina my commitment is sincere.</string>
  <string id="6179983">Then I will remain here to represent the Maker's interests as she thinks best.</string>
  <string id="6179984">When you're a prince, those same jackals will kneel at your feet and pay you taxes.</string>
  <string id="6179985">Being a prince is more fun.</string>
  <string id="6179986">You should ask what's best for your people, not just for you.</string>
  <string id="6179987">What's right for Starkhaven?</string>
  <string id="6179988">You don't become a prince because you want to. You do it because it's your responsibility.</string>
  <string id="6179989">It's your birthright.</string>
  <string id="6179990">I do not have hubris enough to imagine it matters to the common people who rules them.</string>
  <string id="6179993">Kirkwall does well enough with no one in the viscount's seat.</string>
  <string id="6179996">Someone will take the reins. The fields will be planted, the crops gathered.</string>
  <string id="6179999">No one will notice that a Vael lives and isn't there. And I can devote my life to the Maker's will on Thedas.</string>
  <string id="6180000">Nobody tells a prince what to do. Or who to do it with...</string>
  <string id="6180001">Princes are sexy.</string>
  <string id="6180002">Hawke, you— Don't think I'm not tempted.</string>
  <string id="6180005">But I can't. I knelt and swore before the Maker that I would take no bride but Andraste.</string>
  <string id="6180009">I'm just talking about two people, one night, and forgetting all your troubles.</string>
  <string id="6180010">Who said marriage?</string>
  <string id="6180014">If I broke my vows to be with you, I wouldn't be worthy of you.</string>
  <string id="6180017">I already have enough sins to atone for.</string>
  <string id="6180018">I cannot return to Starkhaven—and subject my people to war—without a clear sign that it's the Maker's will.</string>

  <string id="6180314">title&gt;Tarohne's Beginning/title&gt;&#13;
&#13;
In 4:2 Black is the oldest account of the Forbidden Ones, though most mages consider them a hoax. But someone had to make that first deal, that first contact with the other side. From the unknown mage's account:&#13;
&#13;
The first of the magus cast themselves deep in the Fade in search of answers and power, always power. They found the forbidden ones— Xebenkeck, Imshael, Gaxkang the Unbound, and The Formless One. Many conversations were had and much of the fabric of the world revealed. And thus the magic of blood was born.&#13;
&#13;
Even those who consider this folly dare not utter these names.</string>
  <string id="6180315">title&gt;Tarohne's Lessons/title&gt;&#13;
&#13;
Everything you learned was a lie. Andraste was a deluded fool. The Maker is a hoax. There is far more evidence of the Forbidden Ones and demons then has been gathered over a thousand years of a fictitious god.&#13;
&#13;
Demons are not enemies—they are tools to be used. Extract what secrets you can and teach others. Some of us will die, some will be corrupted. But each victory is another pieces of the truth we uncover.</string>
  <string id="6180316">title&gt;Tarohne's Beginnings II/title&gt;&#13;
&#13;
Inside the grimoire's pages were such secrets. A mage's rightful place is not under the heel of the templars. We are masters of the elements. We call forth the spirits themselves. As far as we have advanced, the ancient Tevinter mages knew so much more... and even they were only starting their journey to understand the nature of our world.&#13;
&#13;
We were never meant to walk among mortal men. We were meant to command them.</string>
  <string id="6180317">title&gt;Tarohne's Prophecies/title&gt;&#13;
&#13;
The Fell Grimoire holds the names of power. It holds the key to their summoning. Xebenkeck will return. He will feast on the blood of a thousand of my enemies. It is inevitable!</string>
  <string id="6180318">title&gt;Excerpt from The Last Letters of Tarohne/title&gt;&#13;
&#13;
I have copied the grimoire and hidden it. It must live on. It is the signpost of The Path, and The Path never dies. I have set guardians along it, but you must overcome them. Read the signs, my brothers and sisters. For even if my enemies destroy me, together we cannot fail. There are secrets undreamt of deep in the Fade. Therein lies our destiny—our salvation.</string>
  <string id="6180319">Sundermount</string>
  <string id="6180364">Leave Area</string>
  <string id="6180373">Do you never intend to give a public answer, Your Grace?</string>
  <string id="6180376">What have I been asked?</string>
  <string id="6180379">About the mages! You could calm this fire if you stepped forward.</string>
  <string id="6180382">The Chantry's teachings are clear. Those who turn against them would not listen more to me than to Andraste.</string>
  <string id="6180383">Mage this, templar that. Is there anywhere in Kirkwall people don't talk about this?</string>
  <string id="6180384">Not more mage debates!</string>
  <string id="6180388">The first enchanter overstepped his bounds!</string>
  <string id="6180391">He was provoked.</string>
  <string id="6180394">The people want to know which side you favor. It weakens you—</string>
  <string id="6180397">Strength will not win this fight, Sebastian. </string>
  <string id="6180400">If the Maker is merciful, He will help them find peace. We can only be waiting when they do.</string>
  <string id="6180415">Then you do favor the templars, Your Grace?</string>
  <string id="6180416">Is that your stance?</string>
  <string id="6180417">I favor peace, which is not the goal of either side, I'm afraid.</string>
  <string id="6180420">The last time mages rebelled against the Chantry, they ended up ruling Tevinter. Should we just ignore them?</string>
  <string id="6180423">I knew I liked you.</string>
  <string id="6180426">Well, if it's not too much trouble...</string>
  <string id="6180429">Orsino and the knight-commander will tear Kirkwall apart.</string>
  <string id="6180430">You can't do nothing.</string>
  <string id="6180431">They will try.</string>
  <string id="6180434">I did not expect things to deteriorate so fast. I thought after the Qunari, no one would wish for more violence.</string>
  <string id="6180437">It has drawn more attention than I would like. Sebastian, if I can ask—</string>
  <string id="6180440">Anything, Your Grace.</string>
  <string id="6180443">And the Champion, too, if you will...?</string>
  <string id="6180444">I am your humble servant.</string>
  <string id="6180445">Anything you ask.</string>
  <string id="6180446">You honor me.</string>
  <string id="6180449">I can't imagine any way this will go wrong.</string>
  <string id="6180450">Why not?</string>
  <string id="6180451">What would you have of us?</string>
  <string id="6180454">I agree to nothing until I know what it is.</string>
  <string id="6180455">Ask your question first.</string>
  <string id="6180456">The Divine is concerned about the situation here. She does not want to see the Free Marches become another Imperium.</string>
  <string id="6180459">She has sent an agent to... assess the danger.</string>
  <string id="6180462">Meet with her, please. Tell her drastic measures won't be required.</string>
  <string id="6180463">I don't want to see the Divine's armies march against Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6180464">Of course.</string>
  <string id="6180466">But they are needed.</string>
  <string id="6180469">Messages for the Wardens. Hmm. They'd probably pay to have them returned.</string>
  <string id="6180472">There's the dead drop. Hopefully the Wardens will appreciate this.</string>
  <string id="6180485">The templars are tracking down all apostates. So far, Hightown has been spared their scrutiny, but that will undoubtedly change. If you can help us, and possibly your own family and friends, please contact Mistress Selby at the docks. She's put herself in harm's way to help our lot out. And if just doing the right thing doesn't interest you, each job pays well.&#13;

  <string id="6180486">Has Kirkwall not suffered enough? Should it be declared anathema and an enemy of the Chantry?</string>
  <string id="6180489">Imagine Hightown's streets, filled not just with Meredith's templars, but all the forces the Divine can command.</string>
  <string id="6180492">Surely the Divine wouldn't treat the whole city as enemies!</string>
  <string id="6180495">She is concerned. It is never wise to draw the concern of the powerful.</string>
  <string id="6180498">She is the voice of Andraste. She cannot turn the might of the Chantry against the innocent due to... proximity.</string>
  <string id="6180501">Were no innocents harmed in the Exalted Marches? She will do her best, Sebastian, but she must act first to protect the faith.</string>
  <string id="6180508">What can you tell me about this servant of the Divine?</string>
  <string id="6180509">Who is the agent?</string>
  <string id="6180510">I was not told her real name, only to call her Sister Nightingale.</string>
  <string id="6180513">She is said to be the Divine's left hand, sent to do work that might blacken the Divine's name.</string>
  <string id="6180517">What argument would convince her?</string>
  <string id="6180518">What should we say?</string>
  <string id="6180519">This cannot wait.</string>
  <string id="6180520">We'll go right now.</string>
  <string id="6180521">The mages here must be taught a lesson. I won't stand in the way.</string>
  <string id="6180522">I won't stop the Divine.</string>
  <string id="6180523">No one else's words bear your weight, Champion. If you do not do this, we will have war.</string>
  <string id="6180568">As you read the pages, the words change before your eyes. Fleeting sentences offer tantalizing secrets.</string>
  <string id="6180571">The book offers power in exchange for a promise: to leave it alone afterwards.</string>
  <string id="6180575">Accept the book's deal.</string>
  <string id="6180576">Your eyes can barely keep up with the words as they dance across the page. Knowledge courses through your skull.</string>
  <string id="6180579">It ends, and you feel stronger. You also find it hard to even glance at the book.</string>
  <string id="6180584">This is one of the dead bodies that your anonymous employer wants you to dispose.</string>
  <string id="6180586">Pick up the body.</string>
  <string id="6180587">There must be someplace in the area you can hide the corpse.</string>
  <string id="6180591">Leave it.</string>
  <string id="6180592">This looks like a good place to dispose of a body.</string>
  <string id="6180594">Dump the body.</string>
  <string id="6180596">Leave.</string>
  <string id="6180607">So this is where Mother's from. Charming place.</string>
  <string id="6180608">Mother's dear brother had better come out of the damned woodwork. And soon.</string>
  <string id="6180615">Think you can do something with this, Sandal?</string>
  <string id="6180618">Is that... lyrium? I've never seen anything like that.</string>
  <string id="6180621">It's dangerous. Varric suggested Sandal might be able to dispose of it.</string>
  <string id="6180624">I think my boy can do better than that!</string>
  <string id="6180627">Ooh... enchantment!</string>
  <string id="6180631">Sandal forged the lyrium shard into a rune.</string>
  <string id="6180633">Cavril's Sundries</string>

  <string id="6180674">I must trust your own powers of persuasion now.</string>
  <string id="6180675">Thank you. We cannot allow this... ridiculous mage rebellion to turn into holy war.</string>
  <string id="6180680">The agent, Sister Nightingale, will be waiting in the viscount's throne room tonight. She wishes to remain... unseen.</string>
  <string id="6180683">The room has been sealed since the Qunari incident. It may be difficult to get in without attracting attention.</string>
  <string id="6180687">Who is this?</string>
  <string id="6180690">Surely you recognize the Champion. Or were you too long from Kirkwall to witness the Qunari attack?</string>
  <string id="6180693">My apologies, Champion. I am Sebastian Vael, formerly of Starkhaven, more recently a brother in the Chantry under Her Grace.</string>
  <string id="6180799">That's a lot of armor for a mere brother.</string>
  <string id="6180800">You're not a templar?</string>
  <string id="6180801">I used to be prince of Starkhaven. I've seen my share of battles.</string>
  <string id="6180804">I have no interest in joining the templars, though.</string>
  <string id="6180807">I prefer to serve the Maker in both peace and war, not only if there is someone to fight.</string>
  <string id="6180808">What brings you here?</string>
  <string id="6180809">You're from Starkhaven?</string>
  <string id="6180810">My family was... murdered. I only survived because I had taken vows here in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6180813">The Maker meant you for a different life, Sebastian.</string>
  <string id="6180816">I just wonder sometimes what would have happened if I had returned.</string>
  <string id="6180817">That sounded pretty heated. Don't let me stop you.</string>
  <string id="6180818">What were you talking about?</string>
  <string id="6180819">I'll let you get back to... whatever you were arguing about.</string>
  <string id="6180820">I should go.</string>
  <string id="6180821">No, Champion, if I might, I have a favor to ask of you and Sebastian.</string>
  <string id="6180832">I look forward to working with you, Champion.</string>
  <string id="6180836">I shudder to think of the Divine sending templars against the Free Marches like an enemy state.</string>
  <string id="6180840">Ugh. Did no one think these Qunari deserved a decent burning?</string>
  <string id="6180841">Yes! Like lightning!</string>
  <string id="6180842">Look up there. Those might release the chains.</string>
  <string id="6180845">It's a tough shot, but I should be able to get it from here.</string>
  <string id="6180846">They've sealed the doors. We'll have to find another way in.</string>
  <string id="6180847">The viscount's throne room has been sealed off since his death. A strange place for a holy sister to be.</string>

  <string id="6181450">To me, friends—this one must die!</string>
  <string id="6181451">I could use assistance!</string>

  <string id="6181479">I appear to be... stuck.</string>
  <string id="6181480">Hawke, I can't move!</string>
  <string id="6181481">Damnation! My feet!</string>
  <string id="6181485">It would be good to end this!</string>
  <string id="6181486">My arm is tiring. I can't keep this up.</string>
  <string id="6181487">I'm almost out of tricks.</string>
  <string id="6181491">I'm hurt.</string>
  <string id="6181492">Here! They got me!</string>
  <string id="6181493">Assistance would be appreciated!</string>
  <string id="6181497">Maker forgive you!</string>

  <string id="6181500">May you find peace.</string>

  <string id="6181505">They're shrugging off my arrows!</string>

  <string id="6181516">More! Over there!</string>

  <string id="6181611">Maker, bless your children in their hour of need.</string>
  <string id="6181615">Can we hold? I'm still recovering.</string>
  <string id="6181616">Oooh. This still smarts.</string>
  <string id="6181617">I need rest. And a poultice.</string>
  <string id="6181618">I fear I'm slowing you down.</string>
  <string id="6181619">Blast! My wound is seeping.</string>
  <string id="6181623">Maker, please forgive your children.</string>
  <string id="6181624">We do good work.</string>
  <string id="6181625">No more? I still have arrows.</string>
  <string id="6181626">That really gets the blood flowing!</string>
  <string id="6181627">You've assembled quite the team, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6181631">I really must stop doing this.</string>
  <string id="6181632">Thank you, Maker, for looking after your servants.</string>

  <string id="6181922">Are you saying you will not flee?</string>
  <string id="6181923">You won't leave?</string>
  <string id="6181924">You keep dead people here?</string>
  <string id="6181925">Dusty finger bones?</string>
  <string id="6181926">You do no one any good if you're dead.</string>
  <string id="6181927">You must be safe.</string>
  <string id="6181928">When I became grand cleric, I took a vow to the people of Kirkwall and the Free Marches.</string>
  <string id="6181966">Duty</string>
  <string id="6181999">A grave crime was committed against all free-thinking men and women in the Free Marches. The ruling Vael family in Starkhaven—my family—was brutally murdered, down to the youngest babe in arms. This massacre was carried out by members of the Flint mercenary company. I hereby offer a bounty on the head of each Flint Company soldier in the Kirkwall vicinity.&#13;
&#13;
— Prince Sebastian Vael</string>
  <string id="6182000">Prince Sebastian Vael of Starkhaven has offered a bounty on members of the Flint mercenary company who killed his family.</string>
  <string id="6182004">The Kirkwall Chantry has guarded the remains of the martyr Deverina for eight hundred years. They must be protected.</string>
  <string id="6182009">I will not leave my flock.</string>
  <string id="6182012">Would you let yourself die?</string>
  <string id="6182015">There is no greater devotion than to lay one's life at the Maker's feet. There is no better death than to take the blow for another.</string>
  <string id="6182016">Sister Nightingale took a great risk to warn you. Don't be rash.</string>
  <string id="6182017">Please reconsider.</string>
  <string id="6182018">You don't hear that one quoted often, do you?</string>
  <string id="6182019">That's morbid.</string>
  <string id="6182020">You've been warned. Do what you will.</string>
  <string id="6182021">Fine. Your choice.</string>
  <string id="6182022">Please, your grace. Sister Nightingale thinks there will be war.</string>
  <string id="6182025">Then I must make peace. </string>
  <string id="6182028">If you will not shield yourself, then I will be your shield. You will come through this safely, by the Maker's name. I swear it.</string>
  <string id="6182031">The first Flint Company mercenary group was dealt with. More remain.</string>
  <string id="6182032">The second Flint Company mercenary group was dealt with. More remain.</string>
  <string id="6182033">The third Flint Company mercenary group was dealt with. More remain.</string>
  <string id="6182042">All of the Flint Company mercenary groups were dealt with. Return to the chantry and tell Prince Sebastian Vael that his family is avenged.</string>
  <string id="6182043">Sebastian Vael was very pleased that his family was avenged, and offered a reward.</string>
  <string id="6182062">I'm at your service, Hawke. Where do you want me?</string>
  <string id="6182065">Sebastian, I need you somewhere with a good vantage. Cover us while we move in.</string>
  <string id="6182068">May the Maker favor us now.</string>
  <string id="6182077">Mercenary</string>
  <string id="6182080">This is why Andraste spoke against magic. To the Void with him and his kind!</string>

  <string id="6182129">Fanatic</string>
  <string id="6182133">Fanatic</string>
  <string id="6182139">Look to the Chantry! There is no easy solution here, but the Chantry has kept the balance for a thousand years. Listen to Elthina.</string>
  <string id="6182207">Enter the Fade? Hawke, don't do this. The Golden City was corrupted from such folly.</string>
  <string id="6182270">Elthina! No! Maker, no! She was Your most faithful, Your most beloved...</string>
  <string id="6182273">Why didn't she listen to me?</string>
  <string id="6182276">Maybe she wasn't there. Maybe she made it out...</string>
  <string id="6182279">Blessed be the souls of the faithful that they ascend to Your right hand...</string>
  <string id="6182282">Why are we debating the Right of Annulment when the monster who did this is right here?</string>
  <string id="6182285">I swear to you, I will kill him!</string>
  <string id="6182291">This? This is what you tried to trick me into doing?</string>
  <string id="6182294">And you went along with him!</string>
  <string id="6182297">You were... part of this?</string>
  <string id="6182300">Elthina is not the Circle! She was a good woman, and you murdered her!</string>
  <string id="6182303">But what of Anders?</string>
  <string id="6182306">Your first act must be to execute this traitor.</string>
  <string id="6182373">Did they act alone? We may find answers if we search them.</string>
  <string id="6182382">A secret meeting at the docks. The plot thickens. Shall we?</string>
  <string id="6182440">He should be killed on the spot. With the templars busy, there is no one who can contain him until a trial.</string>
  <string id="6182443">You condone this? The brutal death of an innocent woman of faith? Someone you knew! Who trusted you!</string>
  <string id="6182446">Do not hide behind your spirit! It was your hand that did this.</string>
  <string id="6182449">If I'd been in that chantry today, would you be waffling? You know what must be done!</string>
  <string id="6182452">It will never be enough, but it's a start.</string>
  <string id="6182455">No! You cannot let this abomination walk free. He dies, or I am returning to Starkhaven.</string>
  <string id="6182458">And I will bring such an army with me on my return that there'll be nothing left of Kirkwall for these maleficarum to rule!</string>
  <string id="6182459">Do not interfere, Sebastian.</string>
  <string id="6182460">I will not kill him.</string>
  <string id="6182461">I thought I knew you, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6182464">I gave up on Starkhaven to serve the Maker, but He has turned his back on Kirkwall for harboring heretics like this.</string>
  <string id="6182467">You're the one who taught me that it is the ends that matter, not the steps you take to get there.</string>
  <string id="6182470">I will not fight you, Hawke. My death now would serve nothing.</string>
  <string id="6182473">I will return to Starkhaven. But...</string>
  <string id="6182476">I swear to you, I will come back and find your precious Anders. I will teach him what true justice is!</string>
  <string id="6182479">Thank you for my life. I'll try not to make such a mess of it this time.</string>
  <string id="6182488">He's right. The grand cleric deserves justice.</string>
  <string id="6182489">Fine. Anders dies.</string>
  <string id="6182490">Yes. I would not deny anyone's right to that.</string>
  <string id="6182707">Him being our man would be a trifle too easy.</string>
  <string id="6182710">And this Javaris is supposed to be a master thief?</string>
  <string id="6182711">My throat burns. We must find the source.</string>
  <string id="6182712">Dear Andraste, forgive us. They are beyond our help.</string>
  <string id="6182713">They deserve their fates.</string>
  <string id="6182714">Time to tell the Arishok how he was right... and wrong.</string>
  <string id="6182715">So, who hired that lot? Someone anti-Qunari, anti-viscount, or Saemus himself not wanting to be rescued?</string>
  <string id="6182718">Any chance the Arishok will just give us the viscount's son?</string>
  <string id="6182719">The chantry is never this quiet. Where's Saemus?</string>
  <string id="6182720">Qunari and blood in the chantry. The viscount's son dead. This won't just go away.</string>
  <string id="6182722">A fine mess for both sides.</string>
  <string id="6182738">We won't be here when you get back. We got a campsite outside the city. Look for us there.</string>
  <string id="6182739">There was no time to deal with Aveline's concerns.</string>
  <string id="6182758">You're doing well for yourself.</string>
  <string id="6182761">Her Grace would never be involved in something like this!</string>
  <string id="6182811">There was no time to complete Aveline's request.</string>
  <string id="6182828">These zealots have taken noble ideals too far.</string>
  <string id="6182831">Then we'll find her.</string>
  <string id="6182868">By Chantry law, these mages must be contained. But Elthina, bless her, feared Meredith as much.</string>
  <string id="6182871">I will stand with you, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6182919">The Wardens never received their secret letters.</string>
  <string id="6182924">The trouble on the Wounded Coast continues to this day.</string>
  <string id="6182929">The Carta swindlers continue to harass Lowtown to this day.</string>
  <string id="6182940">Maker forgive me for aiding these apostates, but the knight-commander must be stopped.</string>
  <string id="6182941">Each of these maleficar could have helped Anders with his butchery.</string>
  <string id="6182942">This is everything that Grand Cleric Elthina feared.</string>
  <string id="6182943">We must end this at the Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6182952">Harley and her men were left to die.</string>
  <string id="6182953">The Evets Marauders were killed. It's too late to collect a reward.</string>
  <string id="6182967">No one knows what actually happened between Renvil Harrowmont and the Carta years ago.</string>
  <string id="6182984">Taarbas never located the Qunari blades in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6182986">The accusations against Aveline went unanswered.</string>
  <string id="6183046">It's too late to assist Varric with this now.</string>
  <string id="6183047">It's too late to assist Varric with this now.</string>
  <string id="6183220">A nameless friend has offered a reward for the removal of the minor gangs running rampant at night in Lowtown, Hightown, and the Docks.</string>
  <string id="6183221">All of the minor gangs that claimed Kirkwall over the years have been defeated.</string>
  <string id="6183222">Not all of the minor gangs that claimed Kirkwall over the years were defeated.</string>
  <string id="6183223">The Sharps aim to needle Lowtown to death, but their leader, Ignacio Strand, can't hide forever. Clear their hideout.</string>
  <string id="6183224">Aside from a few stragglers, the Sharps are no longer keen on taking Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6183225">The Sharps claimed Lowtown for several years.</string>
  <string id="6183251">The Redwater Teeth are all over the Docks. Convince their leader, Leech, that his broad reaching is ill-advised by clearing the Redwater hideout.</string>
  <string id="6183252">The Redwater Teeth were once called the Dandy Lampreys. True story.</string>
  <string id="6183253">The Redwater Teeth claimed the Docks for several years.</string>
  <string id="6183259">The Shallowguard use guardsmen uniforms to get close to their victims. Assault their storehouse, and take out the false captain.</string>
  <string id="6183260">Aside from some stragglers, The Shallowguard are no more.</string>
  <string id="6183261">The Shallowguard vexed Hightown for several years.</string>
  <string id="6183262">The Dog Lords are making every Fereldan look bad. Clear their hideout and kill The Bastard.</string>
  <string id="6183263">Aside from a few strays, the Dog Lords are no more.</string>
  <string id="6183264">The Dog Lords claimed Lowtown for several years.</string>
  <string id="6183270">The Carta offshoot The Undercuts are smuggling weapons. Can't have their leader, Kanky Hammertoe, arming just anyone. Clear their hideout.</string>
  <string id="6183271">Aside from a few stragglers, The Undercuts are keeping a low profile.</string>
  <string id="6183272">The Undercuts claimed Lowtown for several years.</string>
  <string id="6183285">The Invisible Sisters claim Hightown at night. Eliminate Gracious Gillian Winger in the group's hideout.</string>
  <string id="6183286">The Invisible Sisters were exposed. Stalkings are down considerably.</string>
  <string id="6183287">The Invisible Sisters claimed Hightown for several years.</string>
  <string id="6183300">The Followers of She are all over Lowtown. Clear their hideout and rid the city of this She.</string>
  <string id="6183301">Hanker and the moderate dreams of her followers are defeated. Only stragglers won't stop believing.</string>
  <string id="6183302">The Followers of She claimed Lowtown for several years.</string>
  <string id="6183311">The Reining Men are corralling people in the Docks. The street's the place to go to oust Leashmaster Jess Varvel from her hideout.</string>
  <string id="6183312">According to all sources, most of the slavers have abandoned Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6183313">The Reining Men claimed the Docks for several years.</string>

  <string id="6183360">Two scrolls. The first is a letter bearing the seal of a lesser Orlesian noble house.&#13;
&#13;
Our line is dead, but still walking. I know not if it is because of the old ways, but my three boys are now something other because of want. If He can be called on, I ask you, Scholar, do so, and the price is paid.&#13;

Two of three, three yourself, asunder.&#13;
Caged, but still meddling, you will not goad me.&#13;
Truth will hold you, or it is no longer true.&#13;
&#13;
The second scroll ends with a crude map, and a handprint in red, the little finger severed at the second knuckle.</string>
  <string id="6183366"> The first scroll bears Rivaini markings.&#13;
&#13;
He was our hero against Par Vollen, and we were in awe. Perhaps it was our fault. There was a day when he changed and saw us as servants, not those he offered to serve. And then he was infested. We need a seal, Scholar, in the faith you choose. The price is paid.&#13;
&#13;
The second scroll is vellum with archaic script and phrasing, but the red ink remains somehow wet.&#13;
&#13;
Of binding a symptom, no vial can contain you.&#13;
Three of three, you perverted a man elevated by others.&#13;
I will not yield, even as I must turn to face you.&#13;
Truth will hold you, or a new truth we will create.&#13;
&#13;
The second scroll ends with a crude map and a handprint in red, the little finger severed at the root.</string>
  <string id="6183367"> The first scroll is marked with a Chasind chieftain’s sigil.&#13;
&#13;
Mine dottir was taken by the caster, and mine legion met him. She was pried from his blood-scrawls, but some horror did inhabit him instead. Mine legion could not contain, and I ask for a seal, whatever the faith. Price be paid, Scholar.&#13;

Though feral mabari were eliminated as a threat within the city, many beasts escaped to infest the countryside. This is an ongoing threat to commerce on several trade routes surrounding the city.&#13;
&#13;
By the authority of the guard, we offer a bounty for these animals. Baiting posts have been set on several trails. Bait them with mutton, and no doubt these animals will make their presence known.</string>

Efforts to control feral mabari have only culled the weakest. The Formari have added to the problem with the escape of a pure breeding bitch two years ago. The wild mabari are showing her influence by herding other animals, a behavior that has recently expanded to hunting lightly armed smugglers.&#13;

&#13;
Kill the fake guards. Simple. Pays well.</string>
  <string id="6183433">Kill the fake guards hiding in Darktown.</string>

Lyrium. All you could want just sitting there in caves that are supposed to be bare. It’s too good to be true! Except that it is true!&#13;
&#13;
I can't get the sweet vision out of my head, but I'm not so foolish to go myself. Stake my claim, or prove me wrong! Either way, payment is yours.</string>
  <string id="6183440">Look for the rumored lyrium cache in the caves near the Deep Roads.</string>
  <string id="6183441">The lyrium cache was a trap. Kill the desire demons.</string>
  <string id="6183442">The demons are gone, and there’s no lyrium to be had.</string>
  <string id="6183443">The claims of lyrium went uninvestigated.</string>
  <string id="6183444">Delyrium, Delightful</string>
  <string id="6183446">We were digging. No harm in that! Maybe we end in a Hightown vault, maybe we don't. But Blind Rudy got turned round and we hit something other. Now we got a walking rock stomping around!&#13;
&#13;
Payment made for anyone who passes that angry stone out of our tunnels before the guards get involved. We need to get back to work!</string>
  <string id="6183447">Destroy the golem wandering Darktown.</string>
  <string id="6183448">Find the Primary linked to the minor golems. Destroy enough of them and its location will appear on the map.</string>

  <string id="6183453">Carta smugglers! Hate them all, especially the factions the Carta can't control! Seems like they could go through proper lines, but if they want to play mean, I'll play mean.&#13;
&#13;
Payment promised for anyone who checks my caches. And if you find a Carta group trying to make coin on the side by thieving, deal with them. Where is the honor among thieves these days?</string>

  <string id="6183458">Just Check the Cache</string>
  <string id="6183460">It’s not fair! Some of us get by just fine on our own greed, but then some fools go and drag demons into it. I need a partner who feels the same.&#13;
&#13;
Payment squared and real for anyone willing to face the demon behind the pickpockets running Lowtown. Kill one or two and she'll show her hand. I know it!</string>

&#13;
Been bartering for absolution. Freelance work. The Chantry doesn't want to dole it out, but I need someone to pick up the donations.&#13;
&#13;
Take care, though. Seems some people think I should actually be a sister. What harm if the people feel better? Besides, the sorts who are desperate for this forgiveness just want the appearance. Killers, mostly. Maker be praised if they are lost to this world.</string>
  <string id="6183468">Empty the fake donation boxes. Watch out for the unrepentant.</string>
  <string id="6183469">The fake donations were collected. Return them to the odd job board in the Lowtown Bazaar.</string>

Wither Nug Storm tells of Lady Mary Sue Constance Trueroyal’s choice between her betrothed, Ser Rival Grouseman, and the young upstart Lieutenant Gerund Uberhart. How unfulfilling must it be for someone to have a copy and not know the gripping conclusion?</string>
  <string id="6183546">She chose a free life on the waves. And several cabin boys. The exploits of Mary Sue are suspect literature at best.</string>

  <string id="6185017">Accompany Sebastian to Lady Harimann's estate to learn why she hired Flint Company to murder his family.</string>
  <string id="6185018">Sebastian has something he would like to discuss with you at the chantry.</string>
  <string id="6185019">Strange things are happening at the Harimann estate. Find out what's behind them.</string>
  <string id="6185020">A group of desire demons tried to block the entrance to a ruin behind the Harimann estate. It appears they—or something they serve—are behind the Harimanns' downfall. Explore the ruin to find what they're protecting.</string>
  <string id="6185021">The desire demon that corrupted Lady Harimann is dead. Leave the ruin and return to the chantry.</string>
  <string id="6185022">The desire demon behind the attack on Sebastian's family was defeated. Talk to Sebastian at the chantry about what happened.</string>
  <string id="6185078">Keran got in over his head. Surely that doesn't merit death?</string>
  <string id="6185085">You cannot think the knight-commander is worse than blood mages.</string>
  <string id="6185088">This is why the Chantry first instituted the Circle. Mages must be protected from themselves.</string>
  <string id="6185091">Pray for her soul, child. The Maker may have mercy even now.</string>
  <string id="6185094">Emile belongs in the Circle, yes, but he is no danger to anyone.</string>
  <string id="6185097">Huon and Evelina were entirely innocent, then?</string>
  <string id="6185100">And you cannot seriously be blind to what just happened!</string>

  <string id="6185201">No wonder the Maker left his children.</string>
  <string id="6185206">Lothering has been destroyed, and you barely escaped with your family. The darkspawn horde is on your heels and right now survival is the only consideration.</string>
  <string id="6185207">You finally reached Kirkwall, though not with everyone. Your sister, Bethany, is dead. So too is Aveline's husband, the templar you encountered while escaping the darkspawn. As bad as things are, however, it seems that Kirkwall offers little respite. The city is flooded with Fereldan refugees and has closed its doors to outsiders. Leaving is not an option—there must be a way in!</string>
  <string id="6185208">You finally reached Kirkwall, though not with everyone. Your brother, Carver, is dead. So too is Aveline's husband, the templar you encountered while escaping the darkspawn. As bad as things are, however, it seems that Kirkwall offers little respite. The city is flooded with Fereldan refugees and has closed its doors to outsiders. Leaving is not an option—there must be a way in!</string>
  <string id="6185221">I must agree, Hawke. Grand Cleric Elthina would never do such a thing.</string>
  <string id="6185230">I'll speak to Her Grace another time. You will not always be here.</string>
  <string id="6185231">You can't keep me from her.</string>
  <string id="6185232">We can't abandon our friend in his hour of need.</string>
  <string id="6185235">This is wrong.</string>
  <string id="6185244">Is that a trick question?</string>
  <string id="6185267">After a year in Kirkwall, you're finally free to make your fortune. An opportunity to join a Deep Roads expedition has arisen—but according to Varric, you'll need to raise enough coin to convince his brother to make you a partner.</string>
  <string id="6185268">Against all odds, you've raised enough coin to become partners in Bartrand's expedition and supplied him with the needed map into the Deep Roads. He's ready to go whenever you are, but beware: it'll be a long trip.</string>
  <string id="6185269">The expedition struck into the Deep Roads... only to find its way blocked by a collapse in the main cavern. You and Varric will need to explore the dangerous side passages to find some way around. If there even is one.</string>
  <string id="6185270">After weeks of travel, the expedition finally found the lost dwarven thaig, full of wonders that even Varric and Bartrand weren't expecting. This mysterious place will need to be explored further.</string>
  <string id="6185271">Bartrand has betrayed you. He took the strange lyrium idol and locked you and Varric inside the crypt where you discovered it. If another way out isn't found you'll be trapped here forever.</string>
  <string id="6185276">In the last three years, you reclaimed your family's mansion in Hightown and become a citizen of note... enough so that Viscount Marlowe Dumar requested your help. Apparently, the Arishok asked to speak with you, and the viscount would like you to go to the Qunari Compound and help the city resolve the growing tension with its foreign visitors.</string>
  <string id="6185277">Viscount Dumar asked that you assist the Arishok with his requests, before tension between the city and the Qunari reaches a breaking point. He's hoping that you, as a prominent citizen of Kirkwall, will be able to serve your home by finding a solution to the coming crisis.</string>
  <string id="6185278">In the last three years, you've become a wealthy and respected citizen. The viscount asked you to aid the Arishok and help resolve the conflict with the stranded Qunari, but things only seem to be getting worse.</string>
  <string id="6185279">It seems Isabela knew more about the Qunari's situation in Kirkwall than she told you. She stole a holy relic from the Arishok and then lost it. Now she's stolen it again and seems to be gone for good. And the Qunari will not rest until they get it back.</string>
  <string id="6185280">Aveline appeared at your home with disturbing news: she's been tasked with arresting several elves that fled justice by taking refuge among the Qunari, and she needs you to go with her to their compound. Considering the tensions with the Qunari following the death of the viscount's son, this visit should be anything but peaceful.</string>
  <string id="6185281">The Arishok refused to hand over the elven fugitives to Aveline. What's more, he will not remain in the city a moment longer without taking action to eliminate what he sees as human greed and corruption. Kirkwall is under attack.</string>
  <string id="6185282">Isabela never got revenge on Castillon.</string>
  <string id="6185284">You are Kirkwall's Champion: the one who foiled the Qunari attack and saved the city's people. With the viscount dead, only Knight-Commander Meredith holds more power... which she uses to crush the Circle of Magi under her heel. You sided with First Enchanter Orsino against her after his speech in Hightown. Whether this will bring more trouble your way remains to be seen.</string>
  <string id="6185285">You are Kirkwall's Champion: the one who foiled the Qunari attack and saved the city's people. With the viscount dead, only Knight-Commander Meredith holds more power... which she uses to combat the rise of illegal magic. You sided with her after First Enchanter Orsino's speech in Hightown, but further problems seem almost certain.</string>
  <string id="6185286">To provoke a confrontation between the templars and mages, Anders destroyed Kirkwall's chantry... killing Grand Cleric Elthina and everyone in it. Knight-Commander Meredith blamed all mages for this disaster and invoked the Right of Annulment on the Circle. You sided with First Enchanter Orsino, but there is an army of templars in the city and you must reach the Gallows before every mage is killed.</string>
  <string id="6185287">To provoke a confrontation between the templars and mages, Anders destroyed Kirkwall's chantry... killing Grand Cleric Elthina and everyone in it. Knowing that the people would only blame the mages, Meredith had no choice but to invoke the Right of Annulment, which means the death of every mage in Kirkwall. You sided with the knight-commander and now must join the templars at the Gallows to restore order.</string>
  <string id="6185288">Knight-Commander Meredith invoked the Right of Annulment on Kirkwall's Circle, which means every mage in the city must die. Meredith's army of templars and city guardsmen now surrounds the Gallows. You must get as many mages out alive as you can.</string>
  <string id="6185289">Knight-Commander Meredith invoked the Right of Annulment on Kirkwall's Circle, which means every mage in the city must die. You stand with Meredith's army of templars and city guardsmen that now surrounds the Gallows. When the assault finally begins, you will face desperate mages that will do anything to survive. Even the templars have their doubts, now, but Meredith insists that this must be done.</string>
  <string id="6185290">Knight-Commander Meredith invoked the Right of Annulment on Kirkwall's Circle, which means every mage in the city must die. The assault on the Gallows is underway and First Enchanter Orsino is gone, having transformed himself with blood magic into a horrible abomination. Now there is only a mad rush for survival.</string>
  <string id="6185291">Knight-Commander Meredith invoked the Right of Annulment on Kirkwall's Circle, which means every mage in the city must die. It turns out Meredith wasn't wrong after all. First Enchanter Orsino used blood magic to transform himself into a terrible abomination and was slain. Order has been restored to Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6185292">You are Kirkwall's Champion: the one who foiled the Qunari attack and saved the city's people. With the viscount dead, only Knight-Commander Meredith holds more power... which she uses to crush the Circle of Magi under her heel. When First Enchanter Orsino spoke out in public against her, you refused to side with either of them. Whether this will just bring you more trouble remains to be seen.</string>

  <string id="6185841">Over the years, Ser Conrad Vernhart's skill at capturing mages has become legendary. He's feared by apostates everywhere.</string>

  <string id="6186323">Years ago, a number of Amaranthine conspirators escaped from Kirkwall. They continue to cause problems for the Warden-Commander.</string>
  <string id="6186325">The lost Qunari patrol was never found.</string>

  <string id="6187719">Crawling through blight-infested tunnels, rescuing Wardens in peril. This is what I signed on for.</string>
  <string id="6187729">You arrived in Kirkwall, but found no refuge. The city is flooded with refugees and is closed to outsiders—and the help your mother hoped to get from your uncle, Gamlen, turned out to be a year of servitude to one of his contacts in exchange for entry. There seems to be little choice but to do as he suggests.</string>
  <string id="6187751">Whatever Anso wanted was lost, and his job was abandoned.</string>
  <string id="6187752">Why didn't your family's enemies hunt you down, as well?</string>
  <string id="6187753">Why are you still alive?</string>
  <string id="6187754">That's why I took the offensive. Thanks to you, those Flint Company assassins are no longer a danger.</string>

  <string id="6187768">Money? Power? It's hard to say.</string>
  <string id="6187771">Lady Harimann was always jealous of my family for being royalty when hers were mere nobility.</string>
  <string id="6187774">But I can't imagine that pushing her into outright murder.</string>
  <string id="6187789">After spending a year working off your debt in Kirkwall, you're finally free to make your fortune. You heard about a rare expedition into the Deep Roads, but according to Bartrand—the dwarf leading it—they don't need additional hirelings. There must be some way to change his mind!</string>
  <string id="6187790">Against all odds, you've raised enough coin to become partners in Bartrand's expedition and supply him with the needed map into the Deep Roads. Bartrand's not ready to leave yet, so there's still time to resolve unfinished business in Kirkwall.</string>
  <string id="6187791">There's one more wrinkle in your effort to join Bartrand's expedition. You'll need to find a map into the Deep Roads, and there's only one way to get it: from Anders, a Grey Warden somewhere in Kirkwall. You'll need the map and the coin before the expedition can leave.</string>
  <string id="6187792">You found a way out of the crypt where Bartrand abandoned you, but you have not escaped harm completely. Bethany has become tainted with the darkspawn's corruption. Anders claims that there may be Grey Wardens nearby, and that they're the only chance Bethany has of surviving.</string>
  <string id="6187793">You found a way out of the crypt where Bartrand abandoned you, but you have not escaped harm completely. Carver has become tainted with the darkspawn's corruption.

  <string id="6187873">Corpse</string>
  <string id="6187889">Thank you, Hawke. This is the right thing to do.</string>
  <string id="6187894">I hope, for all our sakes, she's mistaken.</string>
  <string id="6187898">Because her Grace cares for peace, not your mad theories!</string>
  <string id="6187901">Blind? Elthina sees things all too clearly.</string>
  <string id="6187906">The Arishok refused to hand over the elven fugitives and ordered the Qunari to take over Kirkwall. You escaped and were aided by Knight-Commander Meredith, who is forming a defense and has asked for your help. The Arishok's men are taking captured citizens to the Viscount's Keep, though you're not sure why. If the Qunari are going to be confronted, it will have to be there.</string>
  <string id="6187907">The viscount has not tried to involve the Chantry before.</string>
  <string id="6187910">Right. So do this or the city burns.</string>
  <string id="6187913">But if they are abusing that freedom, they must be dealt with.</string>
  <string id="6187916">Sebastian? Was that his name?</string>
  <string id="6187917">Who is he?</string>
  <string id="6187918">Sebastian Vael. He was affirmed here nearly a decade ago.</string>
  <string id="6187921">He had just been invested as a brother when we got the news about his family.</string>
  <string id="6187924">I'm afraid he reacted rashly—denied his vows and left the Chantry. If the Maker wills it, he will return to himself before it's too late.</string>
  <string id="6187925">So he's some kind of priest?</string>
  <string id="6187926">He's a brother?</string>
  <string id="6187927">He is an initiate of the faith.</string>
  <string id="6187930">As a man, he cannot serve as a mother would, but he has led the Chant here many times.</string>
  <string id="6187933">Before last week, I would have said he was the most faithful of our true believers.</string>
  <string id="6187934">He said someone murdered his family?</string>
  <string id="6187935">What happened?</string>
  <string id="6187936">Sebastian is the youngest son of the ruling family of Starkhaven.</string>
  <string id="6187939">They were overthrown recently. Violently. Sebastian is the only surviving member.</string>
  <string id="6187940">He's royalty?</string>
  <string id="6187941">Ruling family?</string>
  <string id="6187942">Prince Sebastian Vael... if he succeeds in his pledge to take back his lands.</string>
  <string id="6187945">He made a vow to the Maker to put worldly concerns behind him. </string>
  <string id="6187948">It is a sin to forswear himself for a mere title.</string>
  <string id="6187949">I'll make sure he doesn't do anything he regrets.</string>
  <string id="6187950">I'll try to restrain him.</string>
  <string id="6187951">Thank you, Hawke. I trust your discretion.</string>
  <string id="6187952">These people murdered his family. He should do what he likes to them.</string>
  <string id="6187953">He deserves his revenge.</string>
  <string id="6187954">Andraste tells us that revenge is a cycle that only faith will break.</string>
  <string id="6187957">It is the Maker's role to show people the error of their ways. Not ours.</string>
  <string id="6187960">Contrary to your belief, not everyone is out to persecute mages.</string>

  <string id="6188566">Have you asked him? It would be Hawke's decision.</string>
  <string id="6188569">I watched my parents in Starkhaven. When times are good, the city rules itself. Years could pass and no one would notice who's prince.</string>
  <string id="6188572">But when there's famine, when there's war, people look to their leaders. Who does Kirkwall have beyond Hawke?</string>
  <string id="6188575">This is probably a conversation for the two of you to have.</string>
  <string id="6188578">You want me to be viscount?</string>
  <string id="6188581">Andraste said, the Maker is king in the heavens, but it is the kings of Thedas who must recreate His worldly glory.</string>
  <string id="6188584">I keep thinking about that. Who better serves the Maker: a brother of the faith, or a prince who can sway a whole city?</string>
  <string id="6188586">A brother of the faith.</string>
  <string id="6188587">There's no better way to influence people than standing in a big building and singing, don't you think?</string>
  <string id="6188590">The best way to serve the Maker is in his Chantry.</string>
  <string id="6188594">A prince.</string>
  <string id="6188595">A prince can bring the word of Andraste to everyone under his rule.</string>
  <string id="6188598">Princes can make people do things. Priests have to beg.</string>

  <string id="6188606">Every person does the Maker's work in their own way.</string>
  <string id="6188609">You'll never know what the right choice is. Might as well just make one.</string>
  <string id="6188612">You should do what's right for you.</string>
  <string id="6188615">Elthina is risking her life by not deserting her flock. Could I do the same?</string>
  <string id="6188618">It's been fifteen years since I lived in Starkhaven. The people there are only a memory to me.</string>
  <string id="6188621">Kirkwall, the Chantry—that's real. That's where I belong.</string>
  <string id="6188622">You're a man of faith, Sebastian. You would have hated politics.</string>
  <string id="6188623">You're doing the right thing.</string>
  <string id="6188624">Great. Now that that's out of the way, let's get a drink.</string>
  <string id="6188625">Well, I'm glad that's settled.</string>
  <string id="6188626">For the rest of your life, you'll wonder what would have happened if you'd gone back.</string>
  <string id="6188627">You'll regret this.</string>
  <string id="6188628">Starkhaven's loss.</string>
  <string id="6188629">I'm glad you're staying.</string>
  <string id="6188630">Don't do this.</string>
  <string id="6188633">I know you and Anders are... It's not my place to question. But please, be careful.</string>
  <string id="6188636">He's a dangerous man. And selfish. Whatever he promised, don't think he'll ever put you above his own needs.</string>
  <string id="6188637">I... I can't say you didn't factor into my decision. But if I'm to stay in the Chantry...</string>
  <string id="6188640">You mean the world to me, Hawke. I couldn't have gotten through this time without you.</string>
  <string id="6188643">Join me in the Chantry. Pledge yourself to the Maker! We can serve Him together with a chaste marriage in His eyes.</string>
  <string id="6188645">Elthina still won't listen. She's determined to ride this wave until it crashes on the rocks.</string>
  <string id="6188646">If Elthina won't leave Kirkwall, neither will I.</string>
  <string id="6188649">I can't abandon her when the Divine's own agent warned her away.</string>
  <string id="6188650">The grand cleric is lucky to have your loyalty.</string>
  <string id="6188651">You're very devoted.</string>
  <string id="6188652">She'd be luckier were I willing to hit her over the head and carry her away. This isn't her battle.</string>
  <string id="6188655">How much damage could a few dozen angry mages do, anyway?</string>
  <string id="6188656">How bad could it be?</string>
  <string id="6188657">Laughs That's the problem, isn't it? Far more than I ever could.</string>
  <string id="6188660">What about your people?</string>
  <string id="6188661">So you'll abandon Starkhaven?</string>
  <string id="6188662">They can wait. Starkhaven hardly benefits if Kirkwall falls.</string>
  <string id="6188665">And I thought maybe I was the one you wanted to protect.</string>
  <string id="6188666">You're not staying for me?</string>
  <string id="6188667">You are quite capable of fending off a battalion of mages on your own, Hawke.</string>
  <string id="6188670">But if these maleficarum rebel against the knight-commander, Elthina will put herself between them and be torn apart.</string>

  <string id="6188688">Laughs You're probably right. Bootlicking nobles and bickering farmers—I'd have sent the whole lot to do penance.</string>
  <string id="6188691">Laughs Sorry to burden to you with my doubts. But...</string>
  <string id="6188694">I do appreciate you hearing me out. </string>
  <string id="6188697">You've been a good friend, Hawke. I will stay, as much for you as for Her Grace.</string>
  <string id="6188700">Perhaps. But I'd rather that than wonder what a bunch of lunatic mages did to Her Grace.</string>
  <string id="6188706">I would gladly swear my vows beside you.</string>
  <string id="6188707">Yes!</string>
  <string id="6188708">I'll speak to Her Grace about accepting you as a sister in faith. She'll recognize the purity of our love.</string>
  <string id="6188711">I promise you, nothing will come between us.</string>
  <string id="6188713">Are you out of your mind?</string>
  <string id="6188714">A chaste marriage? What's the fun in that?</string>
  <string id="6188717">That's a little sudden.</string>
  <string id="6188720">Do I seem like the priestess type?</string>
  <string id="6188723">I'm sorry. Perhaps I got carried away. The chantry life is not for everyone.</string>
  <string id="6188726">Forget I said anything. I'll always treasure your friendship, Hawke, but I cannot forswear myself again. Even for you.</string>

  <string id="6189028">If you act with a true heart, in a noble cause, it doesn't matter what it takes to succeed.</string>
  <string id="6189031">You should accept the viscount's seat, Hawke. You're the only one worthy of it.</string>
  <string id="6189034">And perhaps one day, we can make a more... formal alliance between the viscountess of Kirkwall and the prince of Starkhaven.</string>

If you're still looking for ways to raise coin, there's a Rivaini ship captain staying at the Hanged Man. My sources say she's hiring people to help her with business here in Kirkwall. Better yet, she apparently came from Denerim, so she shouldn't have any problems working with Fereldans. &#13;
&#13;
I'd highly recommend meeting her, and not just because of this business of hers. From what I've heard, she's the fastest blade in Llomerryn. We might want to bring her along on the expedition, or at least get her out of the Hanged Man before she starts a brawl.&#13;
&#13;
Sincerely,&#13;

  <string id="6195813">This is the right thing to do.</string>
  <string id="6195814">Andraste wouldn't want her Chantry to be a prison and torture-chamber. We must reclaim her mercy.</string>
  <string id="6195817">Oh, she'd probably be lighting fires and screaming freedom with the rest of them.</string>
  <string id="6195820">Laughs I always imagined her with a bit more dignity... but she was a strong defender of the oppressed.</string>
  <string id="6195823">Andraste would side with the victims.</string>
  <string id="6195826">You're right. I should not need you to remind me of such things.</string>
  <string id="6195829">I'm sorry about the grand cleric. But there's much more at stake.</string>
  <string id="6195830">My sympathies on Elthina.</string>
  <string id="6195831">She was a mother to me. To every brother and sister in the chantry. He never took a moment to get to know her.</string>

  <string id="6195837">We've made our decision. I can't go back on it now.</string>
  <string id="6195838">It's too late now.</string>
  <string id="6195839">Then I pray Andraste is watching from the Maker's side and understands that whatever happens, our intentions were good.</string>
  <string id="6195842">I've never known a woman like you. I wish... Never mind. We cannot afford distractions now.</string>
  <string id="6195845">I don't know that we can win this, Hawke, or even if we should. But I will not turn from you now.</string>
  <string id="6195848">You've been a good friend. It will be my honor to fight at your side.</string>
  <string id="6195849">We must show that the Chantry cannot condone tyranny among its templars. We'll worry about the mages after.</string>
  <string id="6195852">To victory, my friend, by any means necessary.</string>
  <string id="6195853">If Elthina had stood firm behind the knight-commander, this wouldn't have happened.</string>
  <string id="6195856">They will all pay for what Anders did.</string>
  <string id="6195857">There are times when even the best intentions lead to the Void.</string>
  <string id="6195858">That was a terrible way to die. The grand cleric deserved better.</string>
  <string id="6195859">I'm sorry about Elthina.</string>
  <string id="6195860">As did your mother, Hawke. We've both lost those dear to us to these maleficarum.</string>
  <string id="6195863">Let's skip the mushy stuff. We've got mages to kill.</string>
  <string id="6195864">I'm bad at long goodbyes.</string>
  <string id="6195865">Laughs And there's no one I'd rather do that with.</string>
  <string id="6195868">Their rebellion will stop here!</string>
  <string id="6195869">We will crush this revolt.</string>
  <string id="6195870">I would not speak ill of the dead, but I wish Elthina had understood that need.</string>
  <string id="6195873">These mages will not stop until they overthrow the Chantry. There was never peace to be made with them.</string>
  <string id="6195876">You're an amazing woman, Hawke. Had we met in different times... But let's not think on that now.</string>
  <string id="6195879">We must defeat these mages, whatever it takes. They shall face the righteousness of the Maker.</string>
  <string id="6195882">The Maker favors us in this fight. He must, for we defend against His enemies.</string>
  <string id="6195885">If we fall here, may we meet again at His side.</string>

&#13;
I have told you a hundred times not to bother the knight-commander with your pathetic questions. She's a busy woman and has no time to nurse you through your crisis of conscience. You are under my command. If you take issues with my orders, you bring them to me or I will see you stripped of your knighthood!&#13;
&#13;
The mage Karl is dangerous and we must take steps to deal with him and any friends who are assisting his rebellion. I expect this done by next week. If I must see to it personally, I will also find out exactly why you failed to carry out your sacred duties.&#13;
&#13;
The Maker has given us a divine task, Bardel. We cannot fail Him.&#13;
&#13;

Isabela's back. She seems more peevish than I remember and kept making snide comments about the Champion of Kirkwall. I thought you two had settled that argument over the Qunari relic, or was I wrong? Could you come over to the Hanged Man and have it out with her once and for all? She still owes me twenty silvers, and I don't want to bring up it up while she's in this mood.&#13;

  <string id="6201343">Aveline's Office</string>
  <string id="6201347">Might be a good time to check back home. You'll be gone for a while, after all.</string>
  <string id="6201350">Gamlen mentioned a letter waiting at home. This might be a good time to get it.</string>
  <string id="6201356">I saw a woman in the alienage that was desperate for help. If we have time, maybe we could speak with her?</string>
  <string id="6201359">Since Bartrand's busy buying new undershorts, let's check into that elf I saw in the alienage. Couldn't hurt.</string>
  <string id="6201362">This might be a good time to look into that rumor in the alienage.</string>
  <string id="6201368">My sources mentioned a young woman outside the chantry in Hightown who was looking for help. Might be worth looking into.</string>
  <string id="6201371">This might be a good time to look into Varric's rumor about the woman outside the chantry.</string>
  <string id="6201377">Wasn't there a dwarven merchant looking for help? If we have time we could seek him out.</string>
  <string id="6201380">You know, there is that merchant I mentioned. More coin never hurts, right?</string>
  <string id="6201383">This might be a good time to look for Javaris, that merchant Varric mentioned.</string>
  <string id="6201389">Wasn't there something about a Chantry sister in Lowtown? You could kill some time checking that out.</string>
  <string id="6201392">We could always look into that Chantry sister slumming in Lowtown. We have the time, right?</string>
  <string id="6201395">This might be a good time to look into Varric's rumor about a Chantry sister fishing for help in Lowtown.</string>
  <string id="6201453">I need your help. Not like last time. This is about the Qunari and... it needs to be fixed fast.</string>
  <string id="6201465">You've settled in nicely.</string>
  <string id="6201468">I deserve it.</string>
  <string id="6201471">It's been hard work to get here.</string>
  <string id="6201474">It's just luck...and skill.</string>
  <string id="6201477">Indeed. Still, more coin never hurts, right? Say, if someone wanted to pass some work your way... ?</string>
  <string id="6201478">Things are busy, Aveline. What's your point?</string>
  <string id="6201479">What is it now?</string>
  <string id="6201480">Yes, good—use that tone on him! Get him out of my hair.</string>
  <string id="6201483">I'm listening, Aveline. What's the trouble?</string>
  <string id="6201484">You can always ask me.</string>
  <string id="6201485">So, how can I be of service this time?</string>
  <string id="6201486">Everybody needs something.</string>
  <string id="6201487">Someone's trying to be a guard. Poorly.</string>
  <string id="6201490">Remember Emeric? The templar? He wants your help and some sort of official sanction.</string>
  <string id="6201493">A templar. Emeric. You don't know him, but he knows you. He wants your help and some sort of official sanction.</string>
  <string id="6201496">Official sanction?</string>
  <string id="6201508">A thorn in my side inventing trouble and scaring people.</string>
  <string id="6201513">For his investigation. He's convinced that every random murder in the past few years is connected, and he won't be quiet.</string>
  <string id="6201514">You don't think it's worth investigating?</string>
  <string id="6201515">Why not check it out?</string>
  <string id="6201516">I have. He even convinced one of my lieutenants to raid the DuPuis mansion. Nothing there.</string>
  <string id="6201519">You wouldn't believe how much ass I had to kiss after that. Bloody hobbyist constable.</string>
  <string id="6201522">Sighs Why can't he spend his declining years building a boat or something?</string>
  <string id="6201523">What can I do that you can't?</string>
  <string id="6201524">And you want me to do what?</string>
  <string id="6201525">I would never say as much, but... he keeps asking for you. Maybe just showing up will calm him down.</string>
  <string id="6201528">He's in the Gallows. If it leads somewhere real, I'll take it off your plate.</string>
  <string id="6201531">Anything to shut him up.</string>
  <string id="6201532">I seem to recall he had some good leads.</string>
  <string id="6201533">He had a good start.</string>
  <string id="6201534">Then you won't mind chasing his threads. If it leads somewhere, I'll pick it up. Right now, he's just distracting my men.</string>
  <string id="6201537">I'll talk to him. Maybe it will lead to something.</string>
  <string id="6201538">Where is he?</string>
  <string id="6201539">If it does, I'll pick it up. Right now, he's just distracting my men.</string>
  <string id="6201542">Thanks, Hawke. I'll try not to make a habit of this.</string>
  <string id="6201543">Muzzle the geezer. Got it.</string>
  <string id="6201544">I'll quiet him down.</string>
  <string id="6201545">I would never say that. But if it leads somewhere genuine, I'll pick it up on your word.</string>
  <string id="6201548">If he shuts up, that's good too.</string>
  <string id="6201551">He's in the Gallows. Do what you can.</string>
  <string id="6201558">He's in the Gallows. Thanks, Hawke. I appreciate it.</string>
  <string id="6201565">Emeric. You've been bothering the captain.</string>
  <string id="6201568">Hello, Emeric. Aveline says you need my help again?</string>
  <string id="6201571">Hello, Emeric. The guard captain says you're still chasing disappearing acts.</string>
  <string id="6201574">Care to tell my why you're bothering the captain of the guard?</string>
  <string id="6201575">Aveline sent me.</string>
  <string id="6201576">My men raided that house. There was nothing, and I've heard no end because of it. You were reprimanded, I hope.</string>
  <string id="6201582">Seems like it should be easy to prove if there are bodies.</string>
  <string id="6201583">Are you sure he's wrong?</string>
  <string id="6201584">Kirkwall isn't the safest place. That doesn't mean everything terrible is related.</string>
  <string id="6201587">If you're going to be picky, the common thread in most of the trouble is you.</string>
  <string id="6201588">There's no sense to that. Can't be.</string>
  <string id="6201600">Someone's always trying to take over at night. But someone else will always pay for their removal.</string>
  <string id="6201601">These thugs are plaguing the streets. I don't see a problem in giving them the fight they want.</string>
  <string id="6201606">These streets should be safe at night. Care to help out with that?</string>
  <string id="6201607">I don't make my guards fight gangs in dark corners. But if you'd like to help...</string>
  <string id="6201612">The streets aren't safe at night. We should do something about that.</string>
  <string id="6201616">How can these nighttime streets be so dangerous? We should clear these idiot thugs out.</string>
  <string id="6201620">Someone's always trying to claim the streets. If you make them safe to travel at night, someone will reward you. </string>
  <string id="6201621">Kirkwall nights aren't safe—always some group of thugs around. Someone will usually pay for their removal, though.</string>
  <string id="6201626">There's always pretenders out at night. Sometimes you have to correct them. Good coin in it, too.</string>
  <string id="6201627">Idiot thugs and their gangs. Always around at night, but there's good coin in getting rid of them.</string>
  <string id="6201632">Bad people come out at night. It would be good to get rid of them.</string>
  <string id="6201633">What makes the gangs so angry at night? Someone should do something about them.</string>
  <string id="6201643">Never a shortage of idiots who think they can take the streets in the dark. But good reward in getting rid of them.</string>
  <string id="6201644">Always coin in getting rid of idiots. Especially thugs who target the streets just because it's dark.</string>
  <string id="6201649">Thugs in the dark. Bet someone would pay for clearing them out.</string>
  <string id="6201650">There's got to be someone who'll pay for clearing these idiots off the streets.</string>

  <string id="6202104">I'm going to die!</string>
  <string id="6202107">There. Got your attention. Real problem.</string>
  <string id="6202108">Hold on. What's this about?</string>
  <string id="6202109">One at a time.</string>
  <string id="6202112">Remember the relic? The one Castillon is going to kill me over? A man called Wall-Eyed Sam has it.</string>
  <string id="6202115">I'm trying to keep the entire city from rioting against the Qunari!</string>
  <string id="6202118">Well, maybe it's connected.</string>
  <string id="6202121">What?</string>
  <string id="6202124">I'm just saying maybe it will help. It's important to someone, right?</string>
  <string id="6202134">This can't be! I'll wake up, and this will all be a terrible dream.</string>
  <string id="6202138">They'll never forgive me. If you weren't here, Hawke, they'd kill me.</string>
  <string id="6202142">I can't go back there, Hawke. You heard Fenarel. If I put one foot inside the camp, the others will attack us.</string>
  <string id="6202148">Everyone, shut up!</string>
  <string id="6202151">What is it now, you two?</string>
  <string id="6202154">Are there any good seats left?</string>
  <string id="6202165">Now you start being responsible? Shit.</string>
  <string id="6202166">Make some sense, both of you!</string>
  <string id="6202167">Just get to the point!</string>
  <string id="6202174">Or losing a friend.</string>
  <string id="6202182">I heard Arishok and die. What's this about?</string>
  <string id="6202183">Start over.</string>
  <string id="6202184">If you help me get it, Castillon won't kill me. Please.</string>
  <string id="6202187">The relic issue has to be resolved before we take on the Qunari.</string>
  <string id="6202188">We help Isabela first.</string>
  <string id="6202189">The Qunari situation is more critical, Isabela.</string>
  <string id="6202190">We deal with the Arishok.</string>
  <string id="6202192">Isn't it odd that someone would run to the Qunari?</string>
  <string id="6202193">Who are the fugitives?</string>
  <string id="6202194">They're elves accused of murder. Maybe they feel they've nothing to lose by fleeing the alienage.</string>
  <string id="6202200">And if their conversion is genuine?</string>
  <string id="6202203">I... don't know. But how many more will try it if I allow this? Justice must be respected.</string>
  <string id="6202204">You're expecting trouble?</string>
  <string id="6202205">What will happen?</string>
  <string id="6202206">After what happened to the viscount's son? Yes.</string>
  <string id="6202209">I'm hoping the Qunari aren't looking for a fight. I'm hoping they'll be reasonable. But we'll see.</string>
  <string id="6202210">This seems like a issue for you and your guards. Quite a few of them.</string>
  <string id="6202211">Why come to me, Aveline?</string>
  <string id="6202212">Sending a full patrol would just increase tension. But you're right: I am the captain. It's my responsibility.</string>
  <string id="6202215">But... I suspect the viscount was hoping I would bring this to you.</string>
  <string id="6202218">Then he should have come himself.</string>
  <string id="6202221">Perhaps, but it's understandable that he's not at his best. I'd like to help him, if I can.</string>
  <string id="6202265">You're sure this is the relic you're after?</string>
  <string id="6202266">Isabela, this is your relic?</string>
  <string id="6202267">Why has this come up so suddenly, Isabela?</string>
  <string id="6202268">And you just now heard this?</string>
  <string id="6202269">You trust her this much?</string>
  <string id="6202272">Probably not. I wouldn't.</string>
  <string id="6202275">They won't wait at the compound forever, Hawke. I really do hope this helps, because if it doesn't...</string>
  <string id="6202278">But... it could be over! I can't... I can't let it slip away again!</string>
  <string id="6202281">I have to go. With or without you.</string>
  <string id="6202284">Hawke, if it could help...</string>
  <string id="6202285">Very well. We'll deal with her problem, and appease the Arishok later.</string>
  <string id="6202286">Fine, we help Isabela first.</string>
  <string id="6202287">Not too much later. The mess at the compound will only get worse.</string>
  <string id="6202290">Buck up, big girl. It's a wonderful day.</string>
  <string id="6202293">It is over, Isabela. This is just more important, and more lives are at stake.</string>
  <string id="6202294">No, the city is paramount.</string>
  <string id="6202295">Right. Of course it's more important. Everything is.</string>
  <string id="6202298">Goodbye, Hawke. Go save the world if it means that much to you.</string>
  <string id="6202304">This has already cost too much.</string>
  <string id="6202307">Meet me at the Qunari Compound, Hawke. Finish up any other business first.</string>
  <string id="6202310">It's already a mess, and it's going to get worse.</string>
  <string id="6202326">She's gone. She took it. That bitch-born whore!</string>
  <string id="6202329">Well, now we get to deal with the Arishok and the fugitives ourselves. That's good.</string>
  <string id="6202332">That's enough. Let's go to the compound.</string>
  <string id="6202341">Come on. Aveline will be waiting at the Qunari Compound. We still have to deal with that mess.</string>
  <string id="6202345">Oh, no, no, no. If anyone kicks her ass, it's me.</string>
  <string id="6202353">Let us do this quickly. I have no wish to stay here.</string>
  <string id="6202354">There is an injustice here that must be stopped—one way or another.</string>

&#13;
You were a pain in the ass to deal with, but a bloody talented one. If you get sick of being just another unemployed refugee in this shithole, maybe we can grab a drink. If there's any odd jobs my boys can't handle, I'll send them your way. &#13;
&#13;
You're welcome,&#13;
Meeran</string>
  <string id="6204248">Hawke,&#13;

Your year's up and you're free to go. Despite what you think, we had a good thing working together. I might pass along an opportunity or two, if you're willing to get your hands dirty. Stay safe.&#13;

  <string id="6205033">Varric's sources say that there's been a number of templar raids held in Lowtown's elven alienage. He can't verify why, however, or who's been giving the orders.</string>
  <string id="6205035">According to Varric, the templars have been actively hunting for a young man named Feynriel. His mother, Arianni, lives in Lowtown's elven alienage and has been seeking help.</string>
  <string id="6205037">According to Varric, a group of mages being transported from Starkhaven hasn't arrived at the Gallows. It's currently just a rumor, however, and cannot be followed up on at this time.</string>
  <string id="6205040">Act of Mercy</string>
  <string id="6205042">According to Varric's sources, someone's been asking questions about a missing templar. No search seems to be underway, however, and nothing can be done to follow up on this just yet.</string>
  <string id="6205044">Varric's sources say that a woman by the name of Macha has been desperately seeking a particular templar. She's been spotted outside of the chantry in Hightown during the day.</string>

  <string id="6205061">Varric says a dwarven merchant named Javaris has been offering a lot of coin for muscle. Finding out exactly where Javaris is, however, seems to be a problem. He'll keep looking.</string>
  <string id="6205063">According to Varric, a dwarven merchant named Javaris has been offering good coin in exchange for help. He's already left the city, but Varric is certain he could be caught up to near either the Wounded Coast or Sundermount.</string>
  <string id="6205064">Blackpowder Promise</string>
  <string id="6205066">Varric has heard rumors that some in the Chantry have been making quiet inquiries around Lowtown about the Qunari. No one seems willing to talk about it, though.</string>
  <string id="6205068">Varric's contacts say that a Chantry sister has been flashing coin around Lowtown, fishing for help with some unnamed problem. Details are light, but it may have something to do with the Qunari. He recommends checking for her in Lowtown.</string>

  <string id="6206062">Do you think the templars will find us here? Maybe we'd be safer with the other refugees...</string>
  <string id="6206064">Let's not talk where there might be templars. When we get home.</string>
  <string id="6206065">Oh, good. We'll just be leaving, then... to go somewhere that isn't the Gallows.</string>
  <string id="6206068">No. No templars in this family.</string>
  <string id="6206079">Do we need to be here? Why do you keep talking to him?</string>
  <string id="6206085">It's the knight-captain. Don't.</string>
  <string id="6206088">Maybe we shouldn't be arguing with the nice templar. Smile and nod... smile and nod...</string>
  <string id="6206098">It's him—that templar from Arianni. I knew this was a bad idea.</string>
  <string id="6206105">Uh-oh. This one will be a harder nut to crack.</string>
  <string id="6206127">As just as his cause is, it scares me. I don't want to give the templars another reason to hunt us.</string>
  <string id="6206130">He's Tranquil. The templars... they did this to him...</string>
  <string id="6206133">Maybe Aveline can find us some work. She's got a position with the city guard now.</string>
  <string id="6206136">Sure, easy. But... maybe Aveline's got some bounties out. She joined the city guard, right?</string>
  <string id="6206140">I said I'm going. Besides, if we're so bloody afraid of templars, I should go and she should hide!</string>
  <string id="6206145">I'm not ending up like that. We're not ending up like that!</string>
  <string id="6206146">I didn't spend the year fighting to give up now.</string>
  <string id="6206147">I don't plan on hiding.</string>
  <string id="6206148">Right. Always got a plan. But I need to know what it is, too.</string>
  <string id="6206151">You can relax. After all, the templars dogging us are mine.</string>
  <string id="6206152">You're no mage. Why worry?</string>
  <string id="6206153">Did I sound that bad? Maker, I'm turning into Gamlen.</string>
  <string id="6206156">We've got to make him take us. Force him, somehow.</string>
  <string id="6206159">We need coin, status, something we can shove in that dwarf's face. And keep people off our backs.</string>
  <string id="6206162">Maybe Gamlen knows someone?</string>
  <string id="6206168">Shrine</string>
  <string id="6206175">My sister always has something up her sleeve. She'd better.</string>
  <string id="6206178">My brother always has something up his sleeve. He'd better.</string>

  <string id="6206188">What? I thought we were taking whatever we could get.</string>
  <string id="6206191">Of course he is. That's just bloody great.</string>
  <string id="6206212">We're scraping to bribe Bartrand, and you don't think having an estate would help?</string>
  <string id="6206213">This is the advantage we need!</string>
  <string id="6206214">Sure it would, but it won't be free. How much unwanted attention will warring with slavers get us?</string>
  <string id="6206228">So much for not attracting templar attention.</string>
  <string id="6206237">Shit! Here we go!</string>
  <string id="6206246">Oh, more attention. That's just grand.</string>
  <string id="6206252">Brother, not now.</string>
  <string id="6206255">Sister, not now.</string>
  <string id="6206258">Yes, how can you say that to the templar right in front of you?</string>
  <string id="6206261">It's the blasted knight-captain. Don't.</string>

  <string id="6206337">Sabina</string>
  <string id="6206343">Doesn't fighting them prove their point? They don't need more reasons to hunt us.</string>
  <string id="6206346">As if the templars need another reason to hunt us.</string>
  <string id="6206361">What, you'd teach the templars their own faith? They seem pretty devout.</string>
  <string id="6206364">Better make this good. We're risking a lot if we anger the templars.</string>
  <string id="6206373">For him? We'll be hunted for sure now.</string>
  <string id="6206376">The templars will think the same. We're friends with a monster.</string>
  <string id="6206379">He's an abomination... and the templars will hunt us for certain.</string>
  <string id="6206382">This will be Mother if we're not careful.</string>
  <string id="6206385">So, they don't always just make you disappear, like it seems?</string>
  <string id="6206388">And I didn't know we would announce it to a templar.</string>

  <string id="6208025">So the Champion was responsible for his brother's death.</string>
  <string id="6208028">So the Champion was responsible for her brother's death.</string>
  <string id="6208031">Yes, but that’s not the connection you're looking for.</string>
  <string id="6208034">Isn't it? Driven from their home, a sister taken against her will?</string>
  <string id="6208037">Isn't it? How else did an apostate remain invisible for so long without help from within the templars?</string>
  <string id="6208043">Isn't it? The involvement of the Grey Wardens makes perfect sense.</string>
  <string id="6208046">Isn't it? Guilt makes for the perfect motivation.</string>
  <string id="6208049">And the Champions’ companions? Merrill, Aveline, Isabela... that Warden, Anders.</string>
  <string id="6208052">And the Champions’ companions? Merrill, Aveline... that Warden, Anders.</string>
  <string id="6208055">Don't remind me. I introduced them.</string>
  <string id="6208058">We thought they all came from Ferelden together, but now it makes sense. Motive and opportunity.</string>
  <string id="6208061">It's still not what you think.</string>
  <string id="6208064">Then I need to hear more.</string>
  <string id="6208067">Unless you've already decided. I can always go if you don't need me anymore…</string>
  <string id="6208070">Tell me what came next.</string>
  <string id="6208075">Don't be so nervous.</string>
  <string id="6208076">Don't be so nervous.</string>
  <string id="6208077">This should be fun.</string>
  <string id="6208078">Don't be so nervous.</string>
  <string id="6208169">Gamlen's boots smell worse than usual. Sniff Ugh! Mabari's been marking his territory again.</string>
  <string id="6208173">Looks like the dog's trying to tunnel his way out of this hovel. Can't blame him.</string>
  <string id="6208177">I can't have Mother living in this hole. We've got to get out of here.</string>
  <string id="6208178">What is that stain?</string>
  <string id="6208179">I feel itchy just looking at that thing.</string>
  <string id="6208183">We should rent this room out.</string>
  <string id="6208187">I think this is the same cheese that was here a year ago.</string>
  <string id="6208191">One scrubbing brush, never used.</string>
  <string id="6208192">Sighs The house won't clean itself, Uncle.</string>
  <string id="6208205">Didn't Fenris say all Tevinter wine is made from the blood and tears of slaves?</string>
  <string id="6208208">I hope he was exaggerating.</string>
  <string id="6208209">Fenris said Danarius left this at the mansion.</string>
  <string id="6208210">If you're telling the truth.</string>
  <string id="6208213">If you are, then… what happened at the Gallows may be far different than we assumed. I need to hear it.</string>
  <string id="6208216">Let’s say I tell you. Then what?</string>
  <string id="6208219">Are you hunting for an infamous apostate? Is that what this is all about? Or is it revenge?</string>
  <string id="6208222">Is the Chantry out for revenge? Is that what this is all about?</string>
  <string id="6208225">No. It's not that.</string>
  <string id="6208228">Then what about me? If what I tell you isn't what you want to hear, will you still let me go?</string>
  <string id="6208233">Tell me what really happened.</string>
  <string id="6208237">Are you sure about this? The Champion was asked to go to the Qunari?</string>
  <string id="6208240">I suppose you think he planned the entire thing?</string>
  <string id="6208243">I suppose you think she planned the entire thing?</string>
  <string id="6208246">Considering what it led to…</string>
  <string id="6208249">Come on, Seeker. I'm not going to sell Hawke short, but nobody could have foreseen the way that would go down.</string>
  <string id="6208252">Or do you still think I'm lying to protect my friend?</string>
  <string id="6208255">There are elements of your story that… make sense. And you couldn't have known about them otherwise.</string>
  <string id="6208258">Well, that’s a relief.</string>
  <string id="6208261">But that doesn't mean you're telling me everything.</string>
  <string id="6208264">I want this story to be told. You're not the first to get it all wrong.</string>
  <string id="6208267">I think I owe Hawke that much.</string>
  <string id="6208270">Then Meredith turned on the Champion. She was to blame.</string>
  <string id="6208273">Then Meredith provoked the Circle. She was to blame.</string>
  <string id="6208276">Or that damned idol was. Or Anders. Take your pick.</string>
  <string id="6208279">Even so, had the Champion not been there…</string>
  <string id="6208282">Then, I suppose, Meredith would be ruling the city still.</string>
  <string id="6208285">It might never have even gone that far.</string>
  <string id="6208288">Is that what this is all about?</string>
  <string id="6208291">You take the book.</string>
  <string id="6208297">I wonder what Bethany would say about all this.</string>
  <string id="6208298">Never thought I'd miss you putting frogs in my bed, Sister.</string>
  <string id="6208299">Wish you were still here.</string>
  <string id="6208303">I'm keeping your sword polished and sharp for you, Brother.</string>
  <string id="6208304">It's insane, but I almost miss his whining.</string>
  <string id="6208311">I've accumulated a lot of junk over the years.</string>
  <string id="6208316">Isabela seemed disappointed that she didn't find anything worth gossiping about. Snoop.</string>
  <string id="6208317">If I catch Sandal rifling through my personal items one more time...</string>
  <string id="6208318">Everything that's left of my life in Lothering...</string>
  <string id="6208319">I could've left the amulet in there and forgotten all about it. What would the witch have done then?</string>
  <string id="6208320">Lots of old things from Lothering in there.</string>
  <string id="6208323">Idunna</string>
  <string id="6208334">Our appreciation for attending the vows of Aveline and Donnic Hendyr. So many guards, and not one on duty. Nice.</string>
  <string id="6208335">Borrowed one of your dresses. Again, Isabela? I have no idea how she manages to fit into them.</string>
  <string id="6208336">Another invitation requesting the presence of the Champion? How many noble parties are there each week?</string>
  <string id="6208337">Meredith's a loony. Who sent this?</string>
  <string id="6208341">I'm glad Bethany always writes.</string>
  <string id="6208345">Ah, Carver. Still as resentful as ever.</string>
  <string id="6208349">Sorry. I was expecting treasure, not spiders. Get well soon. Love, Isabela.</string>
  <string id="6208352">Why do I let her drag me into these things?</string>
  <string id="6208353">I came in and watered your plants! Lots of love, Merrill. That girl's way too nice.</string>
  <string id="6208354">I came in and watered your plants! Your friend, Merrill. Well, that was nice of her.</string>
  <string id="6208355">I'm proud of you. Love, Mother.</string>
  <string id="6208356">Anders's manifesto? Sighs This thing turns up everywhere.</string>
  <string id="6208365">So much has happened since we got here. I'm glad I've got it all written down.</string>
  <string id="6208366">Had breakfast. Visited privy. Took Mother to haberdasher. Huh. Must've been a slow day.</string>
  <string id="6208370">Flemeth.</string>
  <string id="6208373">I thought that might interest you.</string>
  <string id="6208376">You expect me to believe a myth swooped out of the Wilds to save the Champion?</string>
  <string id="6208379">Oh, come now, Seeker. Do I need to recite the tale of the Warden as well?</string>
  <string id="6208382">No. Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised to hear of her involvement.</string>
  <string id="6208385">I liked my version better, too.</string>
  <string id="6208388">What else aren't you telling me, then? Did she send someone with the Champion?</string>
  <string id="6208391">In a manner of speaking.</string>
  <string id="6208394">So it’s true. Continue. But if you tell me they all flew to Kirkwall on a dragon…</string>
  <string id="6208397">Nothing so fanciful, I assure you.</string>
  <string id="6208400">Bullshit. That's not what really happened!</string>
  <string id="6208403">Does that not match the story you've heard, Seeker?</string>
  <string id="6208409">I'm not interested in stories. I came to hear the truth.</string>
  <string id="6208412">What makes you think I know the truth?</string>
  <string id="6208415">Don't lie to me! You knew him even before he became the Champion!</string>
  <string id="6208418">Even if I did, I don't know where he is now.</string>
  <string id="6208421">Don't lie to me! You knew her even before she became the Champion!</string>
  <string id="6208424">Even if I did, I don't know where she is now.</string>
  <string id="6208427">Do you have any idea what's at stake here?</string>
  <string id="6208430">Let me guess: your precious Chantry's fallen to pieces and put the entire world on the brink of war?</string>
  <string id="6208433">And you need the one person who could help you put it back together.</string>
  <string id="6208439">The Champion was at the heart of it when it all began.</string>
  <string id="6208442">If you can't point me to him, tell me everything you know.</string>
  <string id="6208445">If you can't point me to her, tell me everything you know.</string>
  <string id="6208448">You aren't worried I'll just make it up as I go?</string>
  <string id="6208451">Not at all.</string>
  <string id="6208460">You'll need to hear the whole story.</string>
  <string id="6208464">The Champion and her apostate sister came to Kirkwall to spread subversion against the Chantry.</string>
  <string id="6208467">The Champion just happened to have dealings with the Qunari, joined forces with a blood mage, a rebel Warden… and for what? Coin?</string>
  <string id="6208471">Crude drawings in the margins? Sighs Isabela, grow up.</string>
  <string id="6208472">I see Varric's taken it upon himself to add certain embellishments to my journal.</string>
  <string id="6208473">What's this? Oh, Anders's manifesto. Again.</string>
  <string id="6208477">I wonder how much coin I'd make selling my memoirs.</string>
  <string id="6208478">I never have time to write in my journal these days.</string>
  <string id="6208479">Who opened this? Has Sandal been reading my journal? Can Sandal even read?</string>
  <string id="6208485">That dog! Well, maybe chew marks add character to the piece.</string>
  <string id="6208492">Paw prints? I told him to stay off the bed!</string>
  <string id="6208496">Merrill's been jumping on the bed again.</string>
  <string id="6208500">Are those...? A mage and a grown man, and Anders can't pick up his own dirty socks?</string>
  <string id="6208507">I wish Orana would sleep on a real bed.</string>
  <string id="6208542">Fenris hates that statue. Says it reminds him of the Old God relics they had in Tevinter.</string>
  <string id="6208543">Ah... this statue. Wait. Where did I get this statue?</string>
  <string id="6208544">Its eyes follow me around the room. Creepy.</string>
  <string id="6208548">Is that...? Isabela! Who carves that into a stairwell!</string>
  <string id="6208555">All right, so she said to look at the crest sideways, then cover the... Sweet Maker, Isabela! I can't unsee that!</string>
  <string id="6208556">Ah, it's good to be important.</string>
  <string id="6208557">Never thought I'd have my own family crest.</string>
  <string id="6208558">Didn't I see this crest hanging somewhere in the Viscount's Keep?</string>
  <string id="6208573">Can't believe the King of Ferelden eats fifteen pounds of cheese a week. Some Grey Warden appetite!</string>
  <string id="6208574">Sandal sure eats a lot of cheese.</string>
  <string id="6208575">Where do these cheese wheels come from?</string>
  <string id="6208576">Starkhaven Aged Grating Cheese. Did Bodahn buy this?</string>
  <string id="6208577">This looks just like the cheese on the Chanter's Board. I'm harboring a fugitive fromage!</string>
  <string id="6208588">Wish Bodahn would clean the fireplace. Says it reminds him of a mineshaft.</string>
  <string id="6208589">Hey, look! A partially burned page from Anders's manifesto.</string>
  <string id="6208596">Orana's a patient music teacher, but Merrill should really just stick to magic.</string>
  <string id="6208600">Anders may have talents, but playing the lute isn't one of them.</string>
  <string id="6208601">One of the few things Orana owns.</string>
  <string id="6208602">Orana plays the lute beautifully. Must have been one of her duties as a slave.</string>
  <string id="6208606">Ah, the complaints from the neighbors about a Fereldan moving into Hightown. Thanks for filing those, Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6208607">Ah, and another page from Anders's manifesto.</string>
  <string id="6208625">Uh, I think I'll let Sandal empty that.</string>
  <string id="6208632">I think Merrill named this falcon sculpture Finnegan.</string>
  <string id="6208635">No, wait... that's wrong. Finnegan's on the north face. This one's Messere Pointy-Face.</string>
  <string id="6208636">Maker's breath! Put some clothes on, man!</string>
  <string id="6208637">Nice view. I see the Arenbergs have made up.</string>
  <string id="6208638">I wonder where Varric is today. Telling stories about my exploits to anyone who will listen, most likely.</string>
  <string id="6208639">I should get some curtains.</string>
  <string id="6208646">Handprints? Was someone swinging on the chandelier? Merrill...</string>
  <string id="6208647">Handprints? Was someone swinging on the chandelier? Sandal...</string>
  <string id="6208666">Best keep Isabela's books on the top shelf. Don't want to scar Sandal.</string>
  <string id="6208667">The complete People's Laws of Kirkwall. A friendly reminder from Aveline.</string>
  <string id="6208668">A Hundred and One Uses for a Phallic Tuber. Thanks, Isabela, that's a hundred too many.</string>
  <string id="6208672">Fenris's reading has improved. I should pick out a new book for him to work on.</string>
  <string id="6208673">Hard in Hightown: Siege Harder. What does that even mean? Varric must be stopped.</string>
  <string id="6208674">Leather to Feather: Crossroads of Form. I don't even know where to start.</string>
  <string id="6208675">Another copy of Anders's manifestos? Has he been stuffing them into all the books?</string>
  <string id="6208676">The Pursuit of Knowledge, by Brother Genitivi. Varric recommended this book, didn't he?</string>
  <string id="6208683">It's been years, and it's still difficult going into Mother's room.</string>
  <string id="6208687">That's Mother's room. I shouldn't intrude.</string>
  <string id="6208688">I can't bring myself to change anything about Mother's room.</string>
  <string id="6208692">The only thing Merrill's moved in. Maybe she doesn't feel that this is her home yet.</string>
  <string id="6208693">I'll have to remember to water that thing.</string>
  <string id="6208697">Death was too light a punishment, Quentin.</string>
  <string id="6208698">I still expect Mother to greet me at the door sometimes.</string>
  <string id="6208699">I'm Champion now, Mother. I wish you could've lived to see it.</string>
  <string id="6208700">I'm sorry, Mother.</string>
  <string id="6208704">A gift from Aveline. She certainly knows her spirits.</string>

  <string id="6209843">It's close, now. My long wait is almost over.&#13;
&#13;
Am I doing the right thing? It all seemed so clear to me, but now... what have I become? When did this happen? Someone will eventually try to stop me. I've left too many clues for them not to. When they come, should I try to stop them? Maybe the Maker took her from me because I deserved to lose her.&#13;
&#13;
No. It's too late for me to stop, now. The Maker will need to stop me if he thinks I need to be stopped.&#13;
&#13;
No one else.</string>
  <string id="6209844">If we hurry, there might be a trail we can follow.</string>
  <string id="6209850">There's another!</string>
  <string id="6209851">More blood. I'm on the right path.</string>
  <string id="6209852">That bastard better not have touched her.</string>
  <string id="6209853">I'm getting closer.</string>
  <string id="6209854">Where is he taking her?</string>
  <string id="6209855">There. I hope I'm not too late.</string>
  <string id="6209859">There! The foundry! They must have gone inside!</string>
  <string id="6209871">Mother must be here somewhere. We need to look around.</string>
  <string id="6209872">There. More blood. They are here, somewhere.</string>
  <string id="6209890">Where is she?</string>
  <string id="6209891">I have a bad feeling about this.</string>
  <string id="6209892">She has to be here. She has to be.</string>
  <string id="6209893">She must be down here somewhere.</string>
  <string id="6209897">Some kind of magical barrier. There must be a way past it.</string>
  <string id="6209901">Mother!</string>
  <string id="6209904">Alessa.</string>
  <string id="6209914">What... is this?</string>
  <string id="6209919">The woman in the painting... she almost looks like Mother.</string>
  <string id="6209930">I need to find her. Now.</string>
  <string id="6209945">These books... all magic involving dead things. Necromancy.</string>
  <string id="6209948">Why would he have these? What's he planning?</string>
  <string id="6209952">Maker's breath, that smell...</string>
  <string id="6209956">Does he... live here?</string>
  <string id="6209975">I'd wrap up any other business before we go. It's already a mess, and could get worse.</string>
  <string id="6209976">Let's go.</string>
  <string id="6209977">I'm ready.</string>
  <string id="6209978">I still have things I need to do.</string>

&#13;
A title is a poor reward for all that you did for this city against the Qunari. Would that I could give you what you truly deserve. In the meantime, accept this gift, and know that I will always consider you a champion of our faith as much as a defender of our city.&#13;
&#13;
Warm regards,&#13;
&#13;
Knight-Commander Meredith</string>
  <string id="6215720">Champion,&#13;
&#13;
You deserve your new title, despite what Knight-Commander Meredith might prefer. You and I both know what would have happened had you not been there to face the Qunari. I'm sure you've received no shortage of accolades from the powers that be in this city, but for what it's worth, I'm sending a gift from the Circle of Magi, too. Use it well.&#13;

Regards,&#13;
