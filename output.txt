Anders and Aveline
Act 1
 Aveline: I hear good things about you, Anders. Not what I expected.
 Anders: From a mage, you mean.
 Aveline: I didn't say that.
 Anders: How else would you judge me? What else am I a shining example of?
 Aveline: I don't know... other Fereldans lurking in Darktown? Mage or not.
 Anders: You... have a fair point.
───────
  Anders: So you married a templar, huh?
  Aveline: What of it?
  Anders: Are they all as dirty as they seem?
  Aveline: What?
  Anders: Did he ever ask you to play "the naughty mage and the helpless recruit?" Maybe the "secret desire demon and the upstanding knight?"
  Aveline: That's disgusting!
  Anders: I hear it's quite popular.
───────
 Aveline: I could use your consult Anders.
 Anders: Bring it to Darktown, and I'll get you a salve or something.
 Aveline: What? No! I need to know some things about mages.
 Anders: Why?
 Aveline: I'm a guard. I'm the first person who has to deal with... trouble.
 Anders: You want help killing people like me.
 Aveline: Not every mage can be trusted.
 Anders: Nor every guard.
───────
 Anders: Do you ever miss Ferelden?
 Aveline: Of course! It was home. I would never have left willingly.
 Aveline: But I'm not going to be my father and spend my life trying to live a memory.
 Anders: I didn't think I'd give it a second thought once I was gone. I mean, what did Ferelden ever do for me?
 Anders: But I do. I think about it. There's something here that just doesn't feel right.
 Aveline: You mean how mages are treated?
 Anders: No... I think there's not enough dog shit.
───────
Act 2
 Aveline: You're glaring, Anders. Is there a reason, or is it one of your moods?
 Anders: Your term as captain hasn't been particularly "mage friendly."
 Aveline: I've only turned a handful over to the templars.
 Anders: Every despot starts somewhere.
 Aveline: And yet I allow an abomination to whine at me! Credit where it's due.
───────
 Aveline: So you're two people, Anders and... Justice?
 Anders: That's not strictly accurate.
 Aveline: But you are of two minds.
 Anders: Many people are.
 Aveline: Now you're the one not being accurate.
 Anders: I thought those were the rules of this game.
 Aveline: I never know who I'm talking to with you.
 Anders: Then it's fortunate it doesn't occur often.
───────
  Anders: So, I never expected to be palling around with the captain of the guard.
  Aveline: We're not "pals."
  Anders: We're not? What about that time we painted each other's toenails?
  Aveline: Do you want something?
  Anders: Love, life, and liberty. What more does a man need?
  Aveline: You're in a jolly mood.
  Anders: Well, when you're here, I know you're not leading men into Darktown to arrest me.
───────
(If Ella was killed during Dissent)

  Anders: Can I ask you something, Aveline?
  Aveline: I cannot look the other way when mages break the law--
  Anders: That's not what I was going to ask.
  Anders: There's a girl. A mage apprentice. She...was murdered in the Gallows recently. Have you heard anything of it?
  Aveline: You mean the girl you killed.
  Anders: Yes. I'd like to... attend the funeral. Do something.
  Aveline: The official templar report says she was killed by a demon of unknown origin.
  Aveline: Let her family mourn in peace.
───────
Act 3
  Anders: I suppose you're just thrilled how the knight-commander's basically stepped into the viscount's seat?
  Aveline: She can't stall the process forever. It's not her place.
*  Aveline: Leaving the viscount's seat empty will just tempt people to fight for it. It will cause more trouble than it prevents.
  Anders: Well. You've got a brain in there after all.
  Anders: I was convinced that headband was to keep it from falling out.
───────
 Aveline: I have to admit, Anders. Of the mages I know, you're the one I expected to go out in a blaze.
 Anders: The day is young.
 Aveline: It was a compliment, you ass.
 Anders: No, it wasn't.
───────
  Anders: Your husband agrees with me.
  Aveline: About what?
  Anders: He thinks the knight-commander's mad. He told me she's gone behind your back to investigate guardsmen she suspects as secret mages.
*  Aveline: Even if that were true, he wouldn't tell you.
  Anders: He won't fight for her when the time comes. Would you turn against your own husband?
 Aveline: I don't know if you're lying or crazy.
───────
(During The Last Straw)
 Aveline: Just to be clear Anders: when this is over, you will turn yourself in for your crime.
 Anders: I'm well aware of your commitment to oppression.
 Aveline: The laws of the land. Fairly applied to everyone.
 Anders: That...is actually something I'd very much like to see.

Anders and Bethany
  Bethany: So, you were in the Circle and ran away. I don't know if I'd be brave enough to do that.
*  Anders: You've been an apostate your whole life.
  Bethany: Exactly. It was never anything I had to work for.
  Bethany: Other people always took the risks, to keep me free.
───────
  Anders: Where did you learn your magic?
  Anders: I mean, you know my feelings on the Circle, but usually it's the only decent training a mage can get.
  Bethany: My father taught me. He was in the Circle once, trained there. But he got away.
  Anders: You don't know how lucky you were, to have someone who loved you and could help you. Most mages would kill for that.
  Bethany: You remind me of him.
───────
  Anders: The Rite of Tranquility is the whole problem. If they didn't have that to hold over us, we'd have so many more options.
  Bethany: Right! If we want to fight back... or just engage in intelligent debate... they make sure we can't do it.
  Anders: They're forcing our hands. There's no way to change things peacefully.
  Bethany: There must be something.
*  Anders: If it's Tranquility or death, we have no choice but to make every confrontation a life-or-death struggle.
*  Bethany: I know, but... there are good people in the Circle, the Chantry.
  Bethany: There has to be a way to reason with them.
  Anders: Not if they take away your ability to reason.
───────
  Bethany: I know it didn't work the way you wanted, but... it was brave, what you did with Justice.
  Anders: It was meant well. I don't know if that's enough to forgive me.
  Bethany: It must have been hard for him, being trapped outside the Fade. In a place where no one's like him.
  Bethany: I bet he appreciated having a friend.
  Anders: He did.

Anders and Carver
Anders: You don't like me, Carver?
Carver: I don't like you.
Anders: That's unfortunate. Hating someone just because they're a mage is a shameful thing.
Carver: I don't hate you because you're a mage. I hate you because you won't shut up about it.
Carver: Oppression this, templars that. I'd heard enough long before you.
Anders: Maybe it's time you put some thought into it.
───────
Carver: What are you looking at?
Anders:
(If Hawke is male) Your brother is a mage. As was your sister and father?
(If Hawke is female) Your sisters are... were both mages, as was your father?
Carver: And I'm not. What of it?
Anders: Nothing, it's not always passed to all siblings. But it's good to know that you understand our plight.
Carver: Shove your plight.
───────
Anders: I'm sorry about your sister. She sounds like a special girl.
Carver: Why? Because she was a mage?
Anders:
(If Hawke is male) Your brother says she had a good heart. Being on the run never made her bitter.
(If Hawke is female) Your other sister says she was a good person. That she never turned down a chance to help people.
Carver: Yes, yes. I'm sure the Chantry's got a shrine with her portrait on it.
Anders: I was trying to be nice.
Carver: Stick to surly. It works for you.
───────
Anders: Nice day to be planning a trip into the Deep Roads, don't you think?
Anders: The Blight, the dampness, the festering darkness filled with tainted rats...
Carver: Shut up.
Anders: You've got a real chip on your shoulder, you know?
Carver: I've got a big blade on my shoulder, magey.
Anders: Right. Wonder what you're compensating for.

Anders and Fenris
Act 1
Anders: You ever going to stop harping on the mages here?
Fenris: No.
Anders: They aren't what you saw in Tevinter.
Fenris: The moment they are free, mages will make themselves magisters.
Anders: They're slaves! You should want to help them.
Fenris: I don't.
───────
Anders: So, there must be mages in Tevinter that don't use blood magic.
Fenris: Of course. There are slaves. The magisters do not hesitate to collar their own kind.
Anders: But no magisters?
Fenris: Why must you go on about this? No magister would turn down an advantage over his rivals. If he did, he'd be dead.
Anders: You know, to use blood magic you must look a demon in the eye and accept his offer.
Anders: I just figured some of them would say no. For aesthetic reasons, if nothing else.
───────
(After completing Tranquility)
Fenris: Did I hear correctly? You are an... abomination?
Anders: Why don't you shout? I don't think everyone heard you.
Fenris: Do you see yourself as harmless, then? An abomination who would never harm someone?
Anders: Like ripping someone's heart out of his chest?
Fenris: I did that at the behest of no demon.
Anders: So we agree that it doesn't take a demon for someone to be a vicious killer? Good.
───────
Fenris: Why was your friend made Tranquil? Do you know?
Anders: No, and it doesn't matter. Nobody deserves that.
Fenris: I know some mages that deserve that.
Anders: Really? Perhaps they should start making slaves Tranquil—then they wouldn't dream of escaping! Wouldn't that be wonderful?
Fenris: Slaves do not attract demons that try to possess them.
Anders: Which clearly justifies it? What a perfect solution!
───────
Act 2
Fenris: Is there something you want, Anders?
Anders: You really don't have the temperament for a slave.
Fenris: Is that a compliment or an insult?
Anders: I'm just wondering how your master didn't kill you.
Fenris: How have the templars not killed you?
Anders: I'm charming.
───────
Anders: Did you ever think about killing yourself?
Fenris: I could ask you the same thing.
Anders: I'm serious. To get out of slavery, to escape Danarius... don't tell me you never thought about it.
Fenris: I did not. To kill oneself is a sin in the eyes of the Maker.
Anders: You... believe that?
Fenris: I try to. Some things must be worse than slavery.
Anders: Some things are worse than death.
───────
Fenris: You should have lived in Tevinter. You'd be happier there.
Anders: You're probably right.
Fenris: There, your magic would be a mark of honor. Apprenticed to the right Magister, you would do well.
Anders: Is there a down side?
Fenris: Only if you're bothered by owning a few slaves and performing the occasional blood ritual.
Anders: So they all do those things?
Fenris: Just the ones who don't complain about how powerless and persecuted they are.
───────
(If you complete Dissent)
Fenris: I seem to recall you saying something a while ago...
Anders: Shut up.
Fenris: "I can control it." Wasn't that what you said?
Anders: So help me...
───────
(If Hawke spent the night with Fenris)

Anders: I can't imagine what Hawke sees in you.
Fenris: It is done. Leave it be.
Anders: Well, good. I always knew she/he had some sense.
Fenris: Do not make light of this. Leaving was the hardest thing I've ever done.
(If Isabela is in the party)

Isabela: Oh, will you two get over yourselves? You're like two dogs around a bitch in heat.
Fenris: We were talking about Hawke. Not you.
(If Isabela is in the party and you slept with her as well)

Isabela: Oh, will you two get over yourselves? I did her/him too.
───────
Act 3
Anders: Do you still support the Knight-Commander?
Fenris: I don't care a fig for her. But she's the only one holding back the madness in this city.
Anders: Holding back? She's howling at the bloody moon!
Anders: Even her own people think she's lost it.
Anders: What will it take for you to see that she's crazy?
Fenris: Mages in glass houses shouldn't throw fireballs.
───────
Anders: By now, you must see what an injustice the templars are.
Fenris: Must I? I see templars trying to control what they have good reason to fear.
Anders: But they go too far.
Fenris: Talk to Hawke about his/her mother. Ask him/her who went "too far."
Anders: You can't hold all mages responsible for that!
Fenris: It doesn't take all mages to cause this. Only the weak ones.
───────
Anders: Not all mages are weak.
(If Hawke is a mage)

Fenris: True. Hawke, for instance, is not weak.
(Otherwise)

Fenris: Bethany, for instance, was not weak.
Anders: You specifically don't mention me.
Fenris: That's also true.
Anders: I'll prove to you that I'm not weak
Fenris: Prove it to yourself. You're convincing no one else.
───────
(If Hawke spent the night with Fenris, but moved on to Anders)

Anders: You were an idiot to leave Hawke.
Fenris: And you were fast enough to replace me.
Anders: I love him/her. You can't even imagine what that is.
Fenris: Do not bare your heart to me, mage, unless you would have me rip it out.
───────
(If Hawke spent the night with Fenris, but moved on to Anders)

Fenris: You... are living with Hawke now?
Anders: What's it to you?
Fenris: Be good to him/her. Break his/her heart, and I will kill you.

Anders and Isabela
Act 1
Isabela: Hello? Is Anders there? Can I speak to Anders?
Anders: You can stop yelling. It's always me.
Isabela: Oh, good. I didn't want to talk to that other guy. You know, the stick-in-the-mud.
Anders: He can still hear you. Justice and I are one.
Anders: Anyway, you wanted to talk to me?
Isabela: Not really. I just wanted to make sure it was you.
───────
Anders: I keep thinking I know you from somewhere...
Isabela: You're Fereldan, right? Ever spend time at the Pearl?
Anders: That's it!
Anders: You used to really like that girl with the griffon tattoos, right? What was her name?
Isabela: The Lay Warden?
Anders: That's right! I think you were there the night I—
Isabela: Oh! Were you the runaway mage who could do that electricity thing? That was nice...
Hawke: Please stop talking. Now.
(Or if Varric is in the party)

Varric: I don't think I need to know this about either of you.
───────
Anders: Isabela, you never talk about the mages' plight.
Isabela: What's there to say?
Anders: There's plenty to say.
Isabela: And you say enough for the lot of us, don't you think?
Anders: So you're telling me you have no opinion on the matter?
Isabela: None whatsoever!
Anders: That can't be true.
Isabela: No, I'm afraid I'm really this shallow.
───────
Anders: Sometimes, I think you have the right idea.
Isabela: Handcuffs, whipped cream, always be on top?
Anders: I never used to give two bits what anyone thought of me.
Anders: Justice once asked me why I didn't do more for other mages. I told him it was too much work.
Anders: But I couldn't go back after that. Couldn't stop thinking about it.
Anders: Sometimes, I miss being that selfish.
Isabela: Huh? Were you talking? I was still at "whipped cream."
───────
Act 2
Anders: What makes this relic of yours so valuable?
Isabela: The same thing that makes anything valuable. Someone's willing to pay for it.
Anders: That's not evasive.
Isabela: Look, I didn't get where I am by showing my hand, you know?
Anders: No, your hand isn't what I hear you've been showing.
───────
Anders: Do you ever have any regrets?
Isabela: About what?
Anders: Anything? Everything? I can't figure you out.
Isabela: The past's past. I learned that young. If it can't bring you gold or giggles, what's the point in dwelling on it?
Anders: Maybe the chance to fix a mistake? Make things right again?
Isabela: Eh. Our mistakes make us who we are.
Anders: That was almost profound.
───────
Anders: So, this relic you lost... how is it you don't know what it is?
Isabela: It was in a box.
Anders: And you didn't open it? You managed to resist the urge?
Isabela: It was locked. It was a locked box!
Anders: Hasn't stopped you before.
Isabela: What do you want me to say?
Anders: Nothing. I just found it curious, that's all.
───────
Anders: You do have an opinion on mages, don't you?
Isabela: Of course I do. I just don't feel a constant need to bring it up.
Isabela: (Sighs) Mages don't worry me. And I don't believe the templars when they say I should be worried.
Isabela: I'm more likely to be shanked in a bar than eaten by an abomination. You can hear those coming a mile away.
Isabela: "Grr. Argh!" "Oh, is that an abomination coming to eat us? We should get out of here!"
Anders: Abominations don't go, "Grr. Argh."
Isabela: They don't? I should rethink the whole thing, then.
───────
Act 3
Anders: You're not nearly as selfish as you pretend.
Isabela: Hey! You take that back!
Anders: You had your relic. You were gone. There was no reason for you to come back and face the Qunari.
Isabela: I still don't have a ship. I thought I could get one.
Anders: From a bunch of shipwrecked Qunari?
Isabela: From the Viscount. I just got here late.
Anders: I always knew you had a heart of gold.
Isabela: Shh! Don't tell anyone.
───────
Anders: I don't know how you live the way you do, blithely ignoring the consequences of your actions.
Isabela: This is about the Qunari thing, isn't it? I'm not ignoring it. I just recognize that it happened years ago.
Isabela: There's this fantastic thing called "moving on." You should try it sometime.
Anders: Has it occurred to you that Kirkwall is only just recovering from the Qunari attack?
Isabela: And you want me to... what? Flog myself daily?
Isabela: Has it occurred to you that maybe there's no justice in the world? Other than that voice you keep in your head.
───────
Anders: There is justice in the world.
Isabela: Is there? You want to free the mages. Let's say you do, but to get there, you kill a bunch of innocent people.
Isabela: What about them? Don't they then deserve justice?
Anders: Yes.
Isabela: And then what? Where does it end?
Isabela: It's like a bar brawl. People are continuously pulled into the fray, and nobody remembers why it started.
Isabela: Justice is an idea. It makes sense in a world of ideas, but not in our world.
───────
Anders: I can't believe you're still not taking sides.
Isabela: I told you, I only like to be on top.
Anders: I mean against the templars! You like freedom, right? You hate slavery.
Anders: Why wouldn't you side with the mages?
Isabela: Maybe I just don't like you.

Anders and Merrill
Act 1
Anders: So, when you first did blood magic, it was... just an accident, right?
Anders: You cut yourself and realized the power? You didn't actually deal with a demon?
Merrill: Oh, no. I did.
Anders: Why would you do that?
Merrill: I needed his help. He was really very nice about it.
Anders: Of course he was! He's using you to get a foothold in a mortal brain!
Merrill: He's a spirit. He offered me his aid. I hardly think you're one to criticize.
───────
Merrill: I heard Varric saying you were a Grey Warden.
Anders: I was.
Merrill: I met a warden once. Back in Ferelden. Duncan, I think his name was. Very odd man.
Merrill: He had a marvelous beard, though. I'd never seen one before. I thought a squirrel had grabbed him by the chin.
───────
(If the Hero of Ferelden was Dalish and survived the battle with the Archdemon)

Merrill: I heard Varric saying you were a Grey Warden.
Anders: I was.
Merrill: Did you... did you ever meet a Dalish Warden? Mahariel?
Anders: As a matter of fact, I did.
Anders: Do you know her/him?
Merrill: We grew up together. S/He was one of my clan.
Merrill: I keep hoping to hear some news...
Anders: I wouldn't get your hopes up. The Hero of Ferelden values privacy rather highly.
───────
(If the Hero of Ferelden was Dalish, but died killing the Archdemon)

Merrill: I heard Varric saying you were a Grey Warden.
Anders: I was.
Merrill: Did you... did you ever meet a Dalish Warden? Mahariel?
Anders: No. I had a friend who did, though. Told the most impossible stories.
Merrill: I'd like to hear them, sometime. If you don't mind.

In all likelihood, the friend Anders is referring to is Oghren
───────
Merrill: Ser Pounce-a-lot... who knighted him?
Anders: Is that a serious question?
Merrill: Did he have a little sword, or just his claws? I bet he had a dashing cap with a feather in it!
Anders: Would you stop making fun of my cat?
Merrill: Oh... no hat, then?
───────
Anders: Maybe you don't really understand the difference between spirits and demons.
Merrill: Did I ask you?
Anders: Spirits were the first children of the Maker, but He turned his back on them to dote on His mortal creations.
Anders: The ones who resented this became demons, driven to take everything mortals had and gain back the Maker's favor.
Merrill: Your "Maker" is a story you humans use to explain the world.
Merrill: We have our own stories. I don't need to borrow yours.
───────
Act 2
Merrill: You could get another cat, you know. There's one in the Lowtown market with a litter of kittens ready to wean.
Anders: You don't pay attention to templars, Qunari or politics, but you notice kittens?
Merrill: Templars, Qunari, and politics don't meow and attack your feet when you're buying food.
Anders: Are there any tabbies? I'd like a tabby.
───────
Anders: Do Dalish honestly not recognize the difference between demons and beneficial spirits?
Merrill: We've never thought of the Fade as the home of our gods.
Merrill: It is another realm, another people's home. No different or more foreign than, say, Orzammar.
(If Varric is in the party)

Varric: You can say that again.
Anders: But have you never studied the types of demons? They break down very clearly into different sins—
Merrill: Spirits differ from each other, just as you and Hawke and Isabela are all human.
Merrill: More or less...
───────
(If you complete Dissent and stop Anders from killing Ella)

Merrill: Are you all right?
Anders: I nearly killed an innocent girl. How could I be all right?
Merrill: I'm sorry.
Anders: You're sorry? For me? This could be you! You could be the next monster threatening helpless girls!
Merrill: Anders... There's no such thing as a good spirit. There never was.
Merrill: All spirits are dangerous. I understood that. I'm sorry that you didn't.
───────
(If you complete Dissent on a rivalry path with Anders)

Anders: It's not a good feeling, you know.
Merrill: What?
Anders: Being an abomination. I just got a taste of your future.
Merrill: I'm not that foolish. Our relationship is, um, strictly platonic.
Anders: It's like you're trapped in your own body, seeing out your eyes, while someone else moves you like a puppet.
Anders: And you're trying to scream, to move a single muscle, but there's no escape. Until you look down at the blood on your hands...
Merrill: Stop it. You're scaring me.
Anders: That's the point.
───────
Act 3
Anders: You must join us. Do you see that now? You must stand with Kirkwall's mages.
Merrill: It's not my fight.
Anders: You can't hide in Sundermount.
(If the Dalish were killed during A New Path)

Anders: Your clan is dead.
(Otherwise)

Anders: There is no place for you among the Dalish.
Merrill: No! My clan is all I ever cared about! Everything I did, I did for them!
Anders: On second thought, maybe don't try to help us.
───────
Merrill: Have I ever mentioned I like your coat?
Anders: You do?
Merrill: It's very lively! Like a crow in the middle of anting!
Anders: That's.... that's great. Thanks, Merrill.
(If Varric is in the party)

Varric: I tried to warn you, Blondie.
Anders: You're not helping.
(If Isabela is in the party)

Isabela: I wouldn't have called them "lively." Bedraggled, maybe. Or just... fluffy.
Anders: You're not helping.
───────
Merrill: You really believe don't you?
Anders: What are we talking about?
Merrill: Believing. You do I can tell, in freedom, in mages, in good spirits and bad templars. With more fire than the sun.
Anders: And your point is?
Merrill: I miss it sometimes, things being certain.
Anders: Some things are certain.
Merrill: Not anymore.
───────
(During A New Path)

Anders: I don't know why I'm bothering with this, but you do realize it is crazy, right?
Merrill: Believe me I noticed, if I had any other choices, I'd take them.
Anders: You have choices! You always had choices! Stop using blood magic. Get rid of that damned mirror.
Merrill: Oh in that case, I will head back to Kirkwall and throw it away, right after you abandon the plight of the circle of mages.
───────
(If you complete A New Path)

Anders: Your Keeper did not deserve that death.
Merrill: It was my risk to take! I never asked her to do this for me.
Anders: She knew you didn't have the strength to resist the demon. That's why it picked you.
Merrill: Why are you doing this? What can I do about it now?
Anders: Make up for your mistakes. Most blood mages never get a second chance.
───────
(If Hawke romanced Merrill but also slept with Isabela)

Anders: Hawke was a fool to let you move in. You'll only betray him/her. That's all your kind can do.
Merrill: Why do you only do this to me? Are you jealous? You don't get upset about Hawke and Isabela.
Anders: You can't really get jealous of someone for sleeping with Isabela. It's just...understood.
Anders: She's like a side dish. She comes with the meal.
(If Isabela is in the party)

Isabela: Only if it's a good meal.
───────
(If Hawke romanced Anders)

Merrill: Are you happy?
Anders: Beg your pardon?
Merrill: S/He seems happy. Hawke, I mean. Are you?
Anders: Yes, I suppose I am.
Merrill: Good! You've spent much too much time being grumpy. It's a nice change.
───────

Anders and Sebastian
Act 2
Anders: Is that supposed to be Andraste's face on your crotch?
Sebastian: What?
Anders: That... belt buckle thing. Is that Andraste?
Sebastian: My father had this armor commissioned when I took my vows as a brother.
Anders: I'm just not sure I'd want the Maker seeing me shove His bride's head between my legs every morning.
───────
Anders: So, you were invested as a brother in the chantry, right?
Sebastian: I had just taken my vows when I learned my family was killed.
Anders: But you... gave sermons and took confessions and such, right?
Sebastian: Do you have something you wish to confess?
Anders: I just want to know, what do you say when people have questions?
Anders: What's your answer when someone asks, "so if Andraste preached freedom and ended slavery, why do you lock up mages and keep them as slaves?"
Sebastian: No one ever asked that.
───────
Sebastian: You seem very angry.
Anders: And here I thought the Chantry was against mind-reading.
Sebastian: Did something happen to you in the Circle? I understand there were problems in Ferelden...
Anders: Are you saying a mage can only be unhappy in the Circle if demons were involved?
Anders: No, it's not about Uldred. It's not about being beaten or raped by a templar— that does happen, but I've been fortunate.
Anders: It' s a larger principle: the freedom every man, woman, and child born in Thedas have as a natural right.
Sebastian: You were given to the Circle. I was given to the Chantry. Hawke was driven away from home by the Darkspawn.
Sebastian: None of us are free.
───────
(If you complete Dissent)

Sebastian: So your "Tranquil Solution" was hardly the holocaust you imagined.
Anders: You've been seeking revenge for the death of one family for as long as I've known you.
Anders: Are you honestly judging me for trying to save the lives of every mage in Thedas?
Sebastian: But they were never threatened. It was a single man's lunacy.
Sebastian: The Chantry would never follow through with such a thing.
Anders: Yet.
───────
Act 3
Anders: How can you keep standing up for her?
Sebastian: Who?
Anders: That doddering old biddy of a Grand Cleric.
Sebastian: How dare you! Elthina is everything a grand cleric should be. She's holy, wise—
Anders: Spineless... hesitant. She's clay in Meredith's hands.
Sebastian: In the face of danger, sometimes the bravest thing is to stand back and trust that the Maker will see justice done.
Anders: Well if doing nothing sums up your religion, then Elthina is perfect. Personally, I'd prefer a Chantry that favors action over sloth.
───────
Sebastian: You've made no secret of your intent to lead the mages here in revolution.
Anders: Well, I've tried not to shout it from the rooftops. You've just been around when I talk with my friends.
Sebastian: Well, as we have mutual friends—who for some reason don't want you to get hurt—let me tell you this:
Sebastian: If you go forward with this revolt, the Chantry will bring its full might to bear. They will kill you.
Anders: Andraste was killed. That doesn't mean she failed.
Sebastian: Do not compare yourself to Andraste.
───────
Anders: Go ahead. Say it.
Sebastian: Say what?
Anders: I saw you watching me.
Sebastian: I was looking at the clouds.
Anders: Don't give me that. I know you've been judging me.
Anders: You think I'm out of control. How can I claim to speak for mages when I'm half demon myself?
Sebastian: The one over there looks a bit like a bunny rabbit.
(If Merrill is in the party)

Merrill: I saw that too!
───────
Anders: How can you have so much faith? Does nothing bother you?
Sebastian: You're bothering me.
Anders: The Maker left us to our own devices generations ago.
Anders: He's never going to step back in, start listening to our prayers again. He's gone.
Anders: Doesn't that bother you?
Sebastian: He's a merciful lord. He could have destroyed our world when we failed Him, but instead He gave us a chance at redemption.
Sebastian: Should we not be joyful?

Anders and Varric
Act 1
Anders: What?
Varric: Just wondering if the feathered pauldrons are an essential part of the moody rebel mage persona.
Anders: What are you talking about?
Varric: I'm working on an epic poem about a hopelessly romantic apostate waging an epic struggle against forces he can't possibly defeat.
Anders: What do you mean, "can't possibly defeat?"
Varric: Well, it's not a good story unless the hero dies.
───────
Anders: I've always wondered, why is every surface dwarf a merchant or a smith?
Varric: You left out criminals and hired muscle.
Anders: They don't count.
Varric: We dwarves are drawn to shiny objects. Sort of like Magpies, but with business sense.
Anders: You're kidding.
Varric: Of course I am. We come to the surface with the skills our ancestors had, Blondie.
Varric: You think there's a tradition of dwarf woodcutters in Orzammar? Bee keepers? Sailors?
Anders: Well, there could be mushroom growers and nug wranglers.
Varric: Orzammar will never let those people go topside. Too vital. Also, embarrassing.
───────
Varric: So a human, an elf, and a dwarf walk into a bar...
Anders: The human says, "You're lucky you're so short. That hurt like mad!"
Varric: You could have just stopped me, Blondie.
Anders: Why waste a perfectly good set-up?
───────
Act 2
Anders: Boiling in oil.
Varric: Too prosaic. Trapped in a cave with hungry bears, right at the spring thaw.
Anders: That lets him off too easy. Dipped in molten gold and left as a statue in the Viscount's Keep.
Varric: Ooh. That's poetic!
Hawke: What are you two talking about?
Varric: What to do to Bartrand when I find him.
Anders: Any suggestions?
───────
Varric: Blondie, I don't mean to sound critical, but have you considered a new line of work?
Anders: Such as?
Varric: Pretty much anything? I don't think "renegade mage" has a bright future. Or any retirement plan.
───────
Varric: If you've got something to say, just spit it out.
Anders: Are you sure you want to encourage me? I might be about to confess my undying love.
Varric: I get that a lot. So what's on your mind?
Anders: I just realized it's been a while since any of the gangs in the Undercity came to my door.
Varric: They're busy people. Places to go, throats to cut. Maybe you've slipped their minds.
Anders: Right. The apostate running the free clinic in the sewers. Easy to forget. You didn't have anything to do with this?
Varric: You must have me confused with someone else! I'm just a businessman and a storyteller.
───────
(If you complete Dissent)

Varric: Oh, cheer up, Blondie. You're making me cry just looking at you.
Anders: Don't.
Varric: You made a mistake. It happens.
Anders: I almost killed a girl.
Varric: You've killed two-hundred and fifty-four by my last count. Plus about five hundred men, a few dozen giant spiders, and at least two demons.
Anders: It's not the same.
Varric: Why? Because this one you feel bad about? Maybe that's the problem.
───────
Act 3
Varric: So, three templars walk into a tavern.
Anders: Not right now, Varric.
Varric: You feeling all right, Blondie? You're always in the mood for templar jokes.
───────
Varric: So, the knight-commander... Boiling in oil? That one never gets old.
Anders: This is past time for joking.
Varric: I'm helping you indulge in elaborate revenge fantasies. I think it's good for you.
Anders: Meredith will die. Do not doubt that.
Varric: Go away, Justice. Can Anders come out and play?
Anders: [Justice voice] Stop.
Varric: You are no fun anymore.
───────
Varric: You've been glowering for days. Your face is going to get stuck that way.
Anders: My face is the least of my concerns right now.
Varric: That's because you don't have to look at it.
Varric: If you could see it from this angle, Blondie, it'd be at least a close second on your priority list.
───────
(If Hawke romances Anders)

Anders: You're giving me that look again. What are you writing this time?
Varric: So, you and Hawke... I need some details. Did you go down on one knee? Did he/she jump you? Did you swear eternal vows of love, or is this just a physical thing?
Anders: I don't see how that's any of your business.
Varric: Fine, but if you don't tell me, I'm just going to have to make it up.

Aveline and Bethany
Bethany: Was Wesley based out of the Lothering chantry? I don't remember seeing him there.
Aveline: He served elsewhere. He was coming to find me at Ostagar.
Aveline: Were you familiar with every templar in Lothering?
Bethany: How else was I supposed to know when to run and hide?
───────
Bethany: Being a guardsman seems like a better life than being a soldier.
Aveline: Oh?
Bethany: My brother was a soldier. It's all about taking land and serving some king you've never met.
Bethany: Guardsmen, they do something real. They protect people. They make their lives better.
Aveline: I don't know if I agree.
Bethany: Neither would my brother.
───────
Bethany: How come you and Wesley never had children? I mean, sorry if that's too personal—
Aveline: It's all right.
Aveline: I was a soldier and he was a templar. We knew that our personal lives would have to wait.
Aveline: Distance never mattered, but we ran out of time. It is what it is.
Bethany: Now that he's gone, do you ever wish—
Aveline: That's too personal.
───────
Aveline: You show admirable restraint, Bethany.
Bethany: For a mage, you mean.
Aveline: I could also say, "for a Hawke," but yes, for a mage.
Bethany: You have a sword. Why aren't you killing someone right now?
Aveline: Fair point, but I can put my sword down.
Bethany: Believe me, I have tried.
───────
Aveline: I'm sorry I couldn't get you more information about the Circle, Bethany. It's difficult without naming you.
Bethany: Thank you for being discreet. I don't want the templars at my door.
Aveline: No one does.
Bethany: Let them corral the troublemakers. I just want information.
Aveline: Right. Right.
Bethany: It sounds like I'm trying to convince myself, doesn't it?
Aveline: I wouldn't have said. But yes.

Aveline and Carver
Carver: Did you approve my application?
Aveline: I can't make you a guard, Carver.
Carver: We were both soldiers. Why won't they take me?
Aveline: I was an officer. And I follow orders.
Carver: (Laughs) No you don't.
Aveline: I also think of others before myself. You seem tired of that, and that's dangerous.
Carver: Just when it's not my choice. You told them not to take me, didn't you?
Aveline: Yes.
───────
Carver: I'm surprised you still travel with us, Aveline.
Aveline: Carver, don't.
Carver: You're ever so busy with the guardsmen. It must be a burden to slum with the refugees.
Aveline: It's oddly comforting that you insult me like I'm family.
Carver: That wasn't... no, I didn't mean that.
Aveline: I know. But you should be glad that's how I took it.
───────
Aveline: I don't like some of the people you've been associating with, Carver.
Carver: Talk to my brother/sister. He/She's the one in charge.
(If on friendship path with Aveline)

Aveline: Maybe, but I know you get around.
(If on rivalry path with Aveline)

Aveline: Who says I don't mean him/her too?
Aveline: This city's full of people who are dead set on ending badly. I don't want to see you end up the same way.
Carver: Would asking you to stop spying on me help in the least?
Aveline: No.
───────
Aveline: So, Carver, have you thought about what you'll do if your expedition doesn't pay off?
Carver: This is our only chance and you know it.
Aveline: You're so damned proud you couldn't pick up a trade?
Carver: And who would take on a Fereldan apprentice? Maybe in another year I could work my way up to pissboy.
Aveline: Fine, let's crawl down some holes. Good bloody luck for your sake.
───────
Aveline: Tell me, how did your family escape Lothering? Almost everyone who hadn't fled...
Carver:
(If Hawke is male) My brother. If he wasn't with us, I don't think we'd be here.
(If Hawke is female) My older sister. If she wasn't with us, I don't think we'd be here.
Aveline: But you seem quite skilled as well.
Carver: I'm not my brother/sister.
Aveline and Fenris
Act 1
Aveline: Are you safe, Fenris?
Fenris: No.
Aveline: You know, some guards give people the opportunity to lie if it will keep the peace.
Fenris: You can see what I am. Lie to yourself if you must.
───────
Fenris: I understand you're named after a famous knight?
Aveline: Everyone always brings up the name.
Fenris: I've not heard of Ser Aveline—is she very famous?
Aveline: Really? They don't tell of her glorious downfall in Tevinter?
Fenris: Not to slaves.
Aveline: Pardon me for saying so, but thank the Maker for that.
───────
Fenris: You do not like your name?
Aveline: My name is a wish my father made. And I did want to be a knight, but...
Fenris: I see. Still, it's a good name. A strong name.
Aveline: What were you named after?
Fenris: I don't know my real name. My master called me Fenris, his "little wolf."
Aveline: Could you not call yourself something different now?
Fenris: Couldn't you?
Aveline: A fine point.
───────
(Only if you complete The Way It Should Be)

Aveline: You are known, Fenris.
Fenris: What?
Aveline: I'm going through Jeven's neglected reports. Some involve you. And requests about you.
Fenris: By whom?
Aveline: I don't know. They're old, poorly kept. But you should be on your best behavior.
Fenris: Thank you for getting rid of them.
Aveline: I didn't.
───────
Act 2
Aveline: All right, I'm just going to say it. Fenris, you need to present yourself better.
Fenris: What are you talking about?
Aveline: You're squatting in Hightown. I sympathize with your claims, but your neighbors have influence.
Fenris: My claims?
Aveline: To the estate. "Rightfully stolen" isn't exactly something I can forward to the Viscount. Be more discreet about... yourself.
Fenris: I shall endeavor to exist with less offense.
───────
Aveline: Fenris, did you consider my offer for you to train the guard in Tevinter fighting techniques? I've heard nothing.
Fenris: My abilities were inflicted, not taught. I will not pass that on.
Aveline: Some good should come of them.
Fenris: No.
───────
Fenris: It feels good to be captain of the guard, yes?
Aveline: No, I will not change the patrols around your mansion again. There's already been too many questions.
Fenris: You wound my pride with such accusations.
Aveline: But you were going to ask.
Fenris: Eventually.
Aveline: (Laughs) I'll look at the roster and see what I can do.
───────
(During A Bitter Pill, in the Abandoned Slaver Den, when the Blood Sacrifice is examined)

Fenris: See for yourself. The legacy of the magisters.
Aveline: Is this... allowed in Tevinter?
Fenris: In a society where mages rule, they find many ways to justify their need for power.
───────
Act 3
Fenris: I was speaking with Donnic the other day...
Aveline: Since when do you talk with my husband?
Fenris: He... comes to the mansion once a week? We play diamondback.
Aveline: What? Why am I not invited to these games?
Fenris: He says you get angry when you lose.
Aveline: I do not! All right, perhaps I do. Still, that's no reason not to tell me.
(If Isabela is in the party)

Isabela: Perhaps he longed for less masculine companionship?
Aveline: Shut up, whore.
(If Varric is in the party)

Varric: It is if he's a betting man.
Fenris: I disavow any knowledge of gambling occurring in my house.
(Otherwise:)

Fenris: He's a good man, Aveline. I enjoy his visits.
Aveline: Fine, fine. Have your "man time," then.
───────
Aveline: Do you feel like a citizen, Fenris?
Fenris: Excuse me?
Aveline: You've been in Kirkwall as long as I have. Does it feel like home?
Fenris: I have no comparison, really. It feels like a free place.
Aveline: Maybe that's enough.
Fenris: We shall see.
(Alternately, if Fenris is in a relationship with Hawke)

Aveline: You've been in Kirkwall as long as I have. Does it feel like home?
Fenris: It feels. That itself has been a surprise.
Aveline: (If The Long Road was completed)I think I know what you mean.
(or)

Aveline: (If The Long Road was not completed)I think I had a chance for that and missed it.
───────
Aveline: There's a war coming. Does it feel different, fighting by choice?
Fenris: You were never ordered to kill?
Aveline: I was a soldier, but I was willing.
Fenris: I was willing, as well, but not by choice. (Laughs) If that makes any sense.
Aveline: Does anything in this mess?
───────
Aveline: Thank you for that tip, Fenris.
Fenris: You caught them, then?
Aveline: Yes—a whole nest of slave runners working out of the Undercity.
Fenris: I imagine you imprisoned them?
Aveline: Sadly, they never made it to prison.
Fenris: You always know how to make me smile, Aveline.

Aveline and Isabela
Act 1
Aveline: So, Isabela. You're a captain?
Isabela: That's right, big girl. What of it?
Aveline: I don't remember your name on any registries. Every ship that docks has to declare.
Isabela: I never docked, and you're no port authority.
Aveline: And you... are no merchant.
Isabela: Ooh... scrutiny.
───────
Isabela: Do men find you intimidating? What about Wesley? Did he?
Aveline: Isabela...
Isabela: What? Too soon?
Aveline: Too soon, too personal, too... everything coming from you!
Isabela: Ooh, sore spot?
Aveline: If you don't shut up, I'll give you a sore spot.
───────
Isabela: You have such pretty hair. What a lovely color.
Aveline: Other children used to laugh at me for having ginger hair.
Isabela: Really? Aww. I bet you were cute. Did you have pigtails?
Aveline: Sometimes.
Isabela: How precious! Little Aveline, running around the village with her flaming orange pigtails streaming behind her...
Isabela: ... and little boys all scattering and screaming for mercy as she approached.
Aveline: Shut up, whore.
───────
(Only if you complete The Way It Should Be)

Isabela: Well. "Captain." Can I call you captain? You can call me captain.
Aveline: I won't be doing that.
Isabela: Neither will I. Because you're a guard captain. No real authority. Not like on a ship.
Aveline: Well, you would know about having a large number of men under you.
Isabela: You've been waiting to use that one. Did you practice?
Aveline: Shut up.
───────
(When entering the Blooming Rose for the first time)

Isabela: "The difference between whores and courtesans is... well, they have nicer shoes."
Aveline: I think your shoes are fine.
Isabela: Look at you being funny! That might even get you a man someday.
───────
Act 2
Aveline: I had trouble with another one of your women, Isabela. She stole from a... distracted client. You're lucky she wasn't jailed.
Isabela: My women? I am but a shepherd. And what free enterprise are you oppressing now?
Aveline: Theft is not enterprise.
Isabela: Opportunities insufficiently guarded. Victimless crimes.
Aveline: Except for all the victims.
Isabela: Details. Victimless details.
───────
Aveline: How are you so successful with men? You're not that pretty.
Isabela: Cast a wide enough net, and you're bound to catch something.
Aveline: (Laughs) At least you're willing to admit it.
Isabela: Trust me. I've heard, "Get away from me, you pirate hag!" more times than I care to count.
Aveline: Doesn't that bother you?
Isabela: Why should it? They don't know me. I know me.
───────
Aveline: You're right.
Isabela: About?
Aveline: About knowing who you are.
Aveline: I'm the captain of the guard. I'm loyal, strong, and I don't look too bad naked.
Isabela: Exactly. And if I called you a mannish, awkward, ball-crushing do-gooder, you'd say...?
Aveline: Shut up, whore.
Isabela: That's my girl.
───────
 (After completing The Long Road)

Isabela: So, how good is Donnic? Is he cocksure?
Aveline: (Sighs) Just... get it out of your system.
Isabela: Did he curl your toes?
(Isabela will say four of the following at random:)

Isabela: Dwarf your beard?
Isabela: Arl your Eamon?
Isabela: Shank your Jory?
Isabela: Praise your Maker?
Isabela: Grope your grinder?
Isabela: Establish his canon?
Isabela: Kaddis your Katie?
Isabela: Dampen your Divine?
Isabela: Pamper your Paragon?
Isabela: Grey your Warden?
Isabela: Pudding your peach?
Isabela: Float your frigate?
Isabela: Explore your Deep Roads?
(The fifth will always be one of the following)

Isabela: How about "satisfy a demand of your Qun."
Isabela: Or did he Cup your Joining?
Isabela: Or master your taint? That's an old one.
Aveline: Yes, all right? He is an incredibly proficient lover. Happy?
Isabela: Well that's rather personal, don't you think?
───────
Act 3
Aveline: You didn't come to my solstice dinner party.
Isabela: Look at you! Dinner parties, cooking... do you have a lace apron yet, or should I get one for you?
Aveline: Don't change the subject. I sent you an invitation, and you didn't show up.
Isabela: I thought it would be... I mean, I don't know. I just don't do family gatherings.
Isabela: Besides, one day you and Donnic will have children, and I'll be the last person you want around them.
Isabela: Imagine all the awkward questions you'd have to answer. "Mother, what's a Slattern?"
Aveline: I'll just point at you and say, "That's a Slattern."
───────
(If The Long Road was completed)

Isabela: So, Donnic was in the Rose.
Aveline: He was not!
Isabela: Easy, big girl. He wasn't shopping for himself. You're lucky to have a man who wants to please you.
Isabela: But, maybe you could indulge him more. Are there areas of intimacy you haven't explored?
Aveline: Why? Why do you give me these doubts!
Isabela: Aveline. If you shove your thumb up his ass, I win.
(The last line depends on who else is in the party)

Anders: Just... no.
Fenris: (Laughs)
Merrill: Ew!
Varric: Ah, that old chestnut.
Sebastian: Ugh. Maker.
Hawke: (Coughs)
───────
(If The Long Road was not completed)

Isabela: So, Donnic was in the Rose.
Aveline: Good. Happy for him. He needs to calm down.
Isabela: You're tough on the man. I don't see how it's his fault if you missed your chance.
Aveline: Isabela, I realize that you are always prepared for a sudden random phallus, but for your own safety, shut your mouth!
───────
(If The Long Road was completed)

Isabela: How's marriage been treating you, big girl?
Aveline: It's been good. No, great. I'd forgotten what it was like to...
Isabela: Be flipped ass over tits and hammered like a bent nail?
Aveline: To. Be. Loved.
Isabela: Oh. Right, of course.
Aveline: Not that I'm complaining about the other thing.
───────
(If The Long Road was not completed)

Isabela: So how long has it been? Six years? Seven?
Aveline: None of your business.
Isabela: You ever thought of going to the Rose? They're discreet and remarkably affordable if you forgo all the extras.
Aveline: Quiet!
Isabela: Not that sensual massages aren't lovely, but in a dire situation like yours, you need to get straight to the point.
Isabela: Some good old fashioned, headboard slamming-
Aveline: If you don't shut your mouth, I'm going to slam your head against something.
Isabela: (Whistles) Touchy...
───────
Aveline: You know, Isabela, if someone had told me that I'd put up with you for all these years, I'd have punched them flat.
Isabela: And if someone had told me I'd still be here, I'd have done the same.
(If No Rest for the Wicked has been completed and Isabela blackmailed Castillon)

Aveline: You have your ship, what's stopping you?
(Otherwise)

Aveline: Save your bits, you'll have your ship one day.
Isabela: And what would you do without me as a constant headache in the Rose?
Aveline: Someone would rush to fill the hole. You know, like you never left.
Isabela: That's my girl.
Aveline: Maybe you win once in a while.
───────

Aveline and Merrill
Act 1
Merrill: You must really like the Hawke family.
Aveline: Why do you say that?
Merrill: You came all the way from Lothering with them, didn't you? And they're not even your clan.
Aveline: Humans don't have clans, Merrill.
Merrill: Exactly! You came so far together, and you didn't even have a Keeper to make you get along.
Aveline: So your Keeper tells you to stop kicking each other, or she'll turn the aravel around?
Merrill: Sometimes she also warns us to stop pulling hair.
───────
Merrill: I would like to know more about being a guard, Aveline.
Aveline: I don't think that's the job for you.
Merrill: I know, but it might help me not get caught.
Aveline: You probably shouldn't have said that part.
Merrill: Why?
Aveline: Just... never mind.
───────
Merrill: Did Lothering have an alienage?
Aveline: It wasn't a big enough village to have a wall around it, let alone a place for elves.
Merrill: Where did the elves live, then?
Aveline: Stables and outbuildings, mostly.
Merrill: I think I like alienages better.
───────
Merrill: Why don't you arrest us, Aveline?
Aveline: What?
Merrill: We break the law. I'm pretty sure. There are laws for almost everything. You're not a bad guard, are you?
Aveline: No!
(If on a friendship path with Merrill)

Merrill: That's good. Is it because you're fond of Hawke? I kind of am.
Aveline: How very nice for you. Keep it to yourself.
Merrill: I'd rather keep it with her/him.
(If on a rivalry path with Merrill)

Merrill: That's good. You look uncomfortable. Did I say something wrong again?
Aveline: No, Merrill, that's fine.
Merrill: Ah, maybe it's your shoes.
───────
Act 2
Aveline: You're incredibly talented, Merrill. I can see you are meant for great things.
Merrill: Thank you!
Aveline: But... You're stupid.
Merrill: I'm sorry, what?
Aveline: Don't you think it would be better to work on where you are now, instead of recreating old glory?
Merrill: No. No, that's kind of the opposite of what I've been saying. I'm the stupid one? Whatever.
───────
Merrill: The Qunari must like it here, to stay so long.
Aveline: From what I've seen, the Qunari don't like anything.
Merrill: That can't be true. They must like some things... Sunshine? Butterflies? Rainbows?
Aveline: If I spot a Qunari admiring butterflies, Merrill, you'll be the first person I tell.
───────
(After completing The Long Road)

Merrill: (Giggles)
Aveline: Yes?
Merrill: Is it like you thought? It's nice, isn't it? He seems nice.
Aveline: Yes, he's very nice.
Merrill: I know! And you're so cute when you're with him! Not like normal-you at all!
Aveline: Haven't you got something unholy to do?
Merrill: No, we're following Hawke. That's important, too.
───────
(If you complete Mirror Image)

Aveline: This mirror of yours — what does it do?
Merrill: Mostly it stands in my house, looking a bit spooky.
Aveline: But its magic, right? So it can do... Magic things? Is it dangerous?
Merrill: It could fall on someone, but you'd have to push it really hard. It's quite heavy.
Aveline: Merrill, is it a danger to the people of Kirkwall or not?
Merrill: Oh! Only to anyone sitting right under it.
───────
Act 3
Merrill: Aveline, you'll look after Hawke, won't you?
Aveline: The champion of Kirkwall doesn't need my protection (Rivarly with Hawke)
Aveline: Of course I will. What kind of a question is that? (Friendship with Hawke)
Merrill: And sometimes Isabela gets into awful trouble. You'll watch out for her, too?
Aveline: Merrill... what brought this on?
Merrill: Anything could happen. You'll protect them, though. It's what you do.
Aveline: There's nothing to worry about, Merrill.
───────
Merrill: Aveline, what's in your mirror?
Aveline: What do you mean?
Merrill: In your mirror. What do you see?
Aveline: A warrior. A wife. All the mistakes I made to get here and make it right.
Aveline: Why? What have you decided to see?
(If after A New Path and Merrill decided to break the Eluvian)

Merrill: My mirror is broken. But I think... I think I see good things.
Merrill: Maybe a headband...
(If after A New Path and Merrill did not break the Eluvian)

Merrill: Demons. And... cracks.
(Otherwise)

Merrill: Sometimes it's hard to tell. Cracks, mostly.
Merrill: Maybe I'll borrow yours sometime. If that's all right?
Aveline: It's all right.
───────
Aveline: I didn't expect you to stick around for this mess Merrill. This has nothing to do with your elves.
(If Hawke is romancing Merrill)

Merrill: I love Hawke, I wouldn't go anywhere.
Aveline: But it's not your fight.
Merrill: I love Hawke.
Aveline: You said that.
Merrill: I say it a lot. It makes things clearer, takes away doubt when everything is crazy and people are dying.
Aveline: I understand.
Merrill: Oh, good. Someone should.
(If not romanced)

Merrill: Everything affects everything. We were born, a bunch of things happened, and now we're in a mess with our friends.
Aveline: That seems too simple.
Merrill: Simple is good. It sneaks up on you, makes you smile.
Merrill: Maybe that should be enough once in a while.
Aveline: Simple it is.
(If after A New Path)

Aveline: That seems too simple.
Merrill: Simple is good. It sneaks up on you, makes you smile.
Merrill: Or it says "Hey over there!" And kills with a pin.
Aveline: Merrill?
Merrill: Simple Aveline. Not stupid.
───────
Merrill: Aveline... do you think we'll win?
Aveline: Win what?
Merrill: In the end. It feels like something is ending, doesn't it? Do you think we'll win?
Aveline: Nothing is ending, Merrill. Things are a little tense, but it will pass.
Merrill: I hope we win. Varric will make it a good story, I'm sure.
───────
(During A New Path)

Aveline: What should we be prepared for if something goes wrong?
Merrill: I'm not entirely sure. I've never seen an abomination myself. The keeper said they... warp and change before your eyes.
Aveline: So you want us to come along and watch for something, but you don't know what?
Merrill: It's just a precaution, Aveline. Nothing will go wrong.
Aveline: Oh. That's reassuring.

Aveline and Sebastian
Act 2
Sebastian: I understand you are of noble birth.
Aveline: My father was a chevalier. He had to flee Orlais when his patron was murdered.
Sebastian: I'm sorry.
Aveline: I wouldn't have been suited for the life of an Orlesian noblewoman, anyway.
Sebastian: But surely you wish it had been different? To be a lady of Orlais and not a... city guardsman?
Aveline: Not for one moment.
Aveline: I'd rather kill a bandit and save a merchant's family than know the correct dance steps and which rouge is in fashion.
───────
Sebastian: I hope this wasn't presumptuous, but I added your husband's name to the memorial wall in the Chantry.
Aveline: Wesley? But... you never knew him.
Sebastian: He was a templar. He refused to abandon the people of Ferelden to the Blight. He died too young.
Sebastian: The grand cleric will read his name during the Chant of Remembrance.
Aveline: Thank you. That is... very kind.
Sebastian: He walks with the Maker. But it is no shame for those left behind to mourn.
───────
Aveline: So you're a prince, are you?
Sebastian: That is apparently true.
Aveline: There's doubt?
Sebastian: I've accepted the burden. That's all that matters. Why do you ask, Guard-Captain?
Aveline: The entitled types are always trouble.
Sebastian: In that case, I'm glad I don't count myself as one.
Aveline: They never do.
───────
Sebastian: You don't like me, Guard-Captain?
Aveline: I've no issue, so long as the fight over your title remains in Starkhaven. Exactly like it hasn't.
Sebastian: Should I apologize for trying to take back what is rightfully mine?
Aveline: Whatever it takes? No matter the cost?
Sebastian: It feels like your're blaming me for some personal experience of yours.
Aveline: I was at Ostagar. Good people die when leaders "do whatever it takes."
Sebastian: Good people know the necessity.
───────
(Once you complete Repentance)

Sebastian: What have I done now? You look like you wish to scold me.
Aveline: I just can't fathom why you're still in Kirkwall.
Aveline: For six years you've been claiming you'll retake your parent's lands.
Aveline: You're smart, you'd be a capable ruler. What are you waiting for?
Sebastian: I don't know if it's the right thing to do.
Aveline: Do we ever get to know that?
───────
(Once you complete Repentance)

Aveline: Has Starkhaven called for its lost prince, Sebastian? Would you give up if the city has moved on?
Sebastian: Like Ferelden "moved on" after Cailan?
Aveline: You've been reading.
(If Alistair was made king)

Sebastian: It's a good tale. King Alistair is particularly inspiring. But I doubt that's how you see me.
(Otherwise)

Sebastian: It's a good tale. I'm inspired by the Warden Alistair. But I doubt that's how you see me.
(If on rivalry path)

Sebastian: I'm no tyrant, Aveline. If people die restoring me to my place, they'll do it knowing the risk. If that doesn't satisfy, so be it.
Aveline: After your actions here? No, it doesn't.
(If on friendship path)

Sebastian: I don't intend to let anyone die restoring me to my place, Aveline. The risks are mine. And that will have to satisfy.
Aveline: It was well said, I give you that. We'll see.
───────
Act 3
Aveline: Are you loyal, Prince?
Sebastian: Guard-Captain?
Aveline: To Kirkwall. Are you loyal?
Aveline: You're set on a title in Starkhaven, but we're having a crisis here.
Sebastian: This isn't just Kirkwall's concern. If this chaos spreads, Starkhaven will need a strong ruler to beat back the tide.
Aveline: I've seen greater men than you use that excuse.
Sebastian: Noted and ignored, Captain.
───────
Sebastian: Do you have many dealings with the knight-commander?
Aveline: Please don't start with that. I'm not a templar. I'm the captain of the guard.
Aveline: We arrest burglars. The knight-commander never gives us a thought.
Sebastian: Grand Cleric Elthina is worried about her. She's stopped taking the Chantry's advice.
Aveline: Her job's not easy. Certain... forces in the city are allied against her.
(If Anders is in the party)

Anders: Don't try to be subtle. I'm right here.
Sebastian: Clearly, our templars need strong leaders.
Aveline: Until something changes, that's Meredith. And we must give her any support we are able.

Aveline and Varric
Act 1
Aveline: Varric, do you do anything?
Varric: Am I the next stop in your career evaluations? Joy of joys.
Aveline: You watch and you talk. Is that it?
Varric: You are dismissing hallmarks of both the utterly ineffectual and the incredibly dangerous.
Aveline: I don't know what you mean.
Varric: It means coins flow when I talk and when I shut up. Like if you got paid to guard or unguard.
Aveline: That makes no sense.
Varric: Good.
───────
Aveline: Maybe I should put you to use Varric. Have you pen some warnings for the lawless.
Varric: Who's that for? Are most criminals big readers? Seems like pacifying the nobles.
Aveline: Pictures then. It was just a suggestion.
Varric: Well how about a giant sign that just says "Don't." You could hit people with it.
Aveline: Thank you, I get the point.
───────
Varric: A Fereldan in the guard. What will they think of next?
Aveline: You have a problem with that?
Varric: Me? My family's not native either. I'm just surprised. Lots of old prejudice in the guard.
Aveline: I'll give them plenty of reason to change their minds.
Varric: You know, it's possible they're just scared shitless of you. That's my theory, anyway.
───────
Varric: So what do you do, Aveline?
Aveline: You know I'm a guard, why are you asking?
Varric: I mean in your off-duty hours. For fun. You've heard of it, I hope?
Aveline: These are my off-duty hours.
Varric: And the trend of you scaring the piss out of me continues.
───────
Act 2
Aveline: Blondie, Sunshine, Daisy, Rivaini... What am I?
Varric: Beg your pardon?
Aveline: You don't call anyone by name except for me. Where's my nickname?
Varric: That's not true. There's Hawke. And Bianca.
Aveline: "Hawke" is a family name and Bianca is a crossbow. Don't change the subject.
Varric: Haven't thought of a good one yet. What do you think of "Red?"
Aveline: Too common.
Varric: Well, when you think of one, let me know.
───────
Aveline: You, Varric, have a very large mouth.
Varric: And here I've always looked up to you. What is it now?
Aveline: There were fistfights in the barracks over who is the model for your guard serial.
Varric: Hard in Hightown. Riveting stuff. Everyone loves a dirty guard on the edge.
Aveline: Varric.
Varric: Fine. I'll start his big finish. Three chapters until Donnen Brennicovick retires and opens a tavern on the coast.
Varric: I sure hope he makes it. He's getting too old for this shit.
───────
Aveline: You are very close to losing your printing blocks, Varric.
Varric: Once more I am falsely accused of whatever it is that I am accused of. Falsely.
Aveline: Someone swapped the text of my recruitment poster with some filth from the Blooming Rose.
Varric: That does sound pretty good.
Aveline: Sure, fill barracks with whores. But you've also filled the Rose with guards.
Varric: It is true what they say. The best comedy comes from tragedy.
───────
Aveline: You know the Tethras family businesses are registered in your cousin Elmand's name?
Varric: You don't say?
Aveline: But I can't find any record of you having a cousin Elmand.
Varric: I'll introduce you some time. He's a little on the shy side.
Aveline: Varric. He's imaginary.
Varric: Which makes him a much better head of the household than I am. He never misses the Merchants Guild meetings, for one.
───────
Act 3
Aveline: You're too quiet, Varric.
Varric: I'm thinking of switching to romances. Nothing? Not even a foreboding frown?
(Only if The Long Road has been completed)

Aveline: I am content. Write what you will.
Varric: Well that certainly takes the fun out of it. Contentment in the barracks? Who'll pay to hear that shit?
Aveline: Then I should have thought of it years ago.
(Otherwise)

Aveline: Do what you will. I don't care.
Varric: That is... not a comforting thought.
Aveline: It is what it is. I'm used to it.
Varric: I think we've both lost some inspiration.
───────
Aveline: Why are you still here, Varric?
Varric: Starkhaven's too pretentious for me and Cumberland's too boring.
Aveline: You always say you hate commitment, but here you are, six years later, still at Hawke's side.
Varric: Aveline, I thought you'd have noticed by now: I lie a lot.
───────
Aveline: Strange, I always thought I'd wind up arresting you some day.
Varric: If I ever decide to get caught, Aveline, you'll be the guard I let catch me.
Aveline: "Let catch you?"
Varric: "Decide to get caught" didn't trip you up though. Good to know!
───────
Aveline: How are you at finales, Varric?
Varric: I'm expecting some practical experience fairly soon.
Aveline: Make it a good one, will you?
Varric: For you, madam, endless sunsets and roses.
Aveline: Varric.
Varric: And the swift hand of the law sweeping all aside. I thought it went unsaid.
Bethany and Fenris
Fenris: You've been an apostate your whole life, then?
Bethany: Like my father before me. What of it?
Fenris: Didn't your family consider that dangerous?
Bethany: There are mages who go their whole lives without ever falling prey to a demon. Many of them, in fact.
Fenris: And if the Templars came looking for you? That would not be danger enough?
Bethany: Perhaps there shouldn't be any Templars.
───────
Fenris: You know, you cannot wish the Templars away.
Bethany: I can try.
Fenris: Is the Circle here truly so terrible an option?
Bethany: Do you really have to ask that?
Fenris: You would be kept safe from others as well as yourself, and they would be kept safe from you.
Bethany: I... didn't ask for this.
Fenris: Nobody asks for their fate.
───────
Bethany: Do you ever miss Tevinter?
Fenris: I was a slave.
Bethany: Still, it was your home, right? The only one you remember?
Bethany: Does it ever feel strange not to be there?
Fenris: Sometimes. That does not mean I would go back.
───────
Bethany: So, the magister put lyrium in your skin?
Fenris: So I'm told.
Bethany: Does it hurt?
Fenris: You do not want to know the answer to that.
Bethany and Isabela
Bethany: What were you before you were a pirate?
Isabela: I had a husband. He didn't beat me, that's about the best I can say about it.
Bethany: So you left him?
Isabela: He was murdered. By my lover. It was all very... Antivan.
Bethany: Oh. I don't think I'd like to live in Antiva.
───────
Bethany: So you've... been with women. In bed?
Isabela: I know. Shocking, isn't it?
Isabela: You see, sweetness, men are only good for one thing. Women are good for six.
Bethany: Six? Which six?
Hawke: Isabela!
Isabela: (Laughs)
───────
Bethany: I guess you've been with a lot of men.
Isabela: Men. Women. Elves. A dwarf in drag once, but I don't recommend that.
Bethany: Oh.
Isabela: Aw... you're blushing! Why? How many lovers have you had?
Bethany: I-I never—
Isabela: You're a virgin? Hawke, you've been holding out on the poor girl! Get her a night at the Blooming Rose. On me!
Bethany: That's, um, very generous.
Isabela: I'm a giver.
───────
Bethany: That book you were reading this morning, "Hessarian's Spear"— I don't think he had a spear in the legends.
Isabela: He does in this one. Read the description.
Bethany: "Andraste knelt before no man but her Maker, but she hadn't counted on the archon Hessarian."
Bethany: "Can Hessarian penetrate the tight-knit defenses of the warrior-prophetess? Will she be prepared to face the full blast of his... power?"
Bethany: Wait a minute... Isabela! This is a vulgar thing!
Isabela: You want to borrow it?
Bethany: No!
Isabela: You sure? It has pictures!
Bethany: Not listening! I'm not listening!
───────
((When entering the barracks in the Viscount's Keep)

Isabela: Coming here of my own free will feels wrong... Like diddling a sister.
Bethany: Why? Why do you say these things?
Bethany and Merrill
Bethany: So, there's no Circle among the Dalish?
Merrill: Any child with the gift of magic is apprenticed to a Keeper... in another clan if there's no need in her own.
Bethany: That sounds nice.
Merrill: Magic is a gift of the Creators. Why wouldn't we use it?
Merrill: It just seems... wasteful for humans to lock their mages away where they can't do any good.
(If Fenris is in the party)

Fenris: Of course, you're a blood mage.
Bethany: Oh. Right.
(Otherwise)

Bethany: But... you are a blood mage.
───────
Bethany: So, is the Keeper... your mother?
Merrill: I left my clan when I was a child to become Marethari's First.
Merrill: I haven't seen my parents in more than ten years.
Bethany: I'm so sorry! My father died in the Blight. You must really miss them.
Merrill: I remember my mother singing to me, when I was a little girl and I'd get sick. I think that's what I miss the most.
Merrill: The Keeper has a terrible singing voice.
───────
Merrill: You're so lucky.
Bethany: How do you figure?
Merrill: I wish I had a brother/sister and a mother and an uncle.
Merrill: It must be wonderful. You'd never be alone!
Bethany: It is wonderful. Although it might be better without Uncle Gamlen.
───────
Merrill: If you could do anything - just anything at all - what would you do?
Bethany: That's easy. Be normal. No magic, just... normal.
Merrill: Really? You wouldn't fly across Thedas or eat a cake the size of Kirkwall? Keep a baby griffon for a pet?
Bethany: Well, now that you say it, the griffon might not be so bad.
Merrill: I'd name mine "Feathers."
Bethany and Varric
Bethany: You don't seem to like your brother very much.
Varric: And here I thought it took blood magic to read minds.
Bethany: I had a twin brother, Carver. He used to nail my braid to the bed while I was sleeping.
Bethany: I never thought I'd miss him this much.
Varric: Sorry about your brother.
Varric: Hey, you want mine? I've got a spare...
───────
Bethany: Do you ever wish you lived in Orzammar?
Varric: Great Ancestors, no! You know what Orzammar is?
Varric: It's cramped tunnels, filled with nug-shit and body-odor.
Varric: And every person there thinks he's better than you because his great-great-great grandfather made a water-clock or something.
Bethany: But they're your people. Don't you even wonder what it would be like?
Varric: I have a good imagination. Why would I waste it on that?
───────
Bethany: Are you really not afraid of apostates? Not even a little?
Varric: Sunshine, I'm a dwarf. In case you missed that detail.
Bethany: Dwarves aren't completely immune to magic, you know.
Varric: Who has time to worry about apostates with a Merchant's Guild breathing down your neck?
Bethany: In that case... I see.
───────
Bethany: Your family used to be noble, right?
Varric: By some definition of the term.
Bethany: Do you ever wonder what your life would have been like, if you were still nobles?
Varric: Sunshine, nobility is just an expensive lifestyle. I've already got one of those.
Bethany: Nobles have power, too. And responsibilities.
Varric: Estates, servants, investments, mercenaries, assassins? We've still got all those things.
Varric: It's sunnier here, and nobody calls me my lord. I think I can live with that.
───────
Only if Birthright has been completed:

Varric: So... Milady Sunshine, what's your first act as a noblewoman going to be?
Bethany: A noblewoman with no fortune and no title? Looking for work, probably.
Varric: Practicality is for peasants, my lady. You need to do something frivolous to celebrate your birthright.
Bethany: Such as...?
Varric: Come up to the Hightown Market and complain bitterly that there's no Orlesian silk that matches your eyes.
Bethany: But what if something does match my eyes? What will I do, then?
Varric: Insist that they're blatantly copying you, and demand royalties. A good noble always has a complaint ready, Sunshine.
Carver and Fenris
Carver: So... this master of yours wants your markings back? Skin and all?
Fenris: So his hunters told me. Unwillingly.
Carver: So why not cover them up? Wouldn't that make you harder to find?
Fenris: Let them come. I am not one to hide.
Carver: Still, if it were me—
Fenris: It's not.
───────
Carver: So you've really never thought of hiding from those hunters?
Fenris: To what end?
Carver: So you could, I don't know, have a life?
Fenris: What life do you have? There are no hunters after you at all.
Carver: I have a life!
Fenris: One that you complain about. We are not always free to do as we wish, as you should well know.
Carver: I do have a life.
Fenris: Then I stand corrected.
───────
Carver: You're very different from other elves.
Fenris: Oh? You know them all?
Carver: No. I just... you look different. There's no denying that.
Fenris: It is what I am. And unlike the problems you claim to have, I really did have no choice.
Carver: Do we know anyone who isn't brooding every hour of the day?
Fenris: Like attracts like, it seems.
───────
Carver: You know, Fenris, I have a tattoo.
Fenris: You have a what?
Carver: A tattoo. A lot of us got them before Ostagar. It's a Mabari. For strength.
Fenris: Does it curse you with the ability to reach into a man and tear out his insides?
Carver: Uh. I can make it bark.
Fenris: Please don't.
(Next line depends on the third companion present)

Anders: Yes, refrain.
Aveline: Agreed.
Isabela: Rather see it wag.
Merrill: That's... ew.
Varric: Seconded.
Hawke: (Sighs)

Carver and Isabela
Isabela: I saw you at the Blooming Rose the other night.
Carver: What? No you didn't.
Isabela: I suppose someone else stole your chin to romance Faith?
Carver: (Scoffs) That's unlikely. She wasn't even working.
Isabela: Mm-hmm. Got you.
(The next line changes depending on your third party member)

Aveline: Carver!
Varric: Oh ho! Nicely done.
Merrill: I don't get it.
(If one of the previous lines didn't trigger, and Hawke has not slept with anyone in the Blooming Rose)

Hawke: Carver, what would Mother say?
Carver: You're just... that's not what I... shit!
───────
Carver: So, Isabela. You captained a ship? That's a lot of men to handle. For you to command.
Isabela: Well aren't you just adorable fumbling for a topic.
Carver: You say that like I'm harmless.
Isabela: As harmless as a pup that will someday grow into its fangs and sink them deep.
Carver: Sure, keep teasing. I'll show you how much of a pup I am.
Isabela: I know. That's why I do it.
───────
Isabela: You look like a man I once dueled.
Isabela: He was a little intimated by my reputation as a vicious pirate, but rose to the challenge.
Carver: He looked like me, you say?
Isabela: It went on all night, under the stars, the waves lapping at our ankles.
Carver: On the beach? In the surf? How did you get proper footing?
Isabela: We didn't. There was quite a bit of tumbling around, and we were soaked and sore by the time the sun came up.
Carver: Did you... win?
Isabela: I managed to get on top in the end, but I considered it a tie.
───────
Carver: Why is it always about sex with you?
Isabela: It's not. Sometimes it's about sex with other people.
Carver: You see? It comes up every single time we talk.
Isabela: We're just talking, Carver. If it comes up, that's not my fault.
Carver: What? I mean... that's not what I meant. It... it doesn't!
Carver: I hate you so much.

Carver and Merrill
Carver: So, you're not like a lot of other girls.
Merrill: No, I'm an elf.
Carver: Right, alright then.
Merrill: Oh, did I miss something dirty?
Carver: What? No! It wasn't dirty. It wasn't anything.
Merrill: Oh? Right, because I miss a lot of dirty things and sometimes I wouldn't mind hearing them.
Carver: Would you now?
───────
Carver: Your people came a long way Merrill, but I like to think that we have Ferelden in common.
Merrill: I never saw Lothering. Did you walk as much as we did? Probably more, you didn't start with halla. Our ship stunk.
Carver: Your ship?
Merrill: There was something foul in the hold. I can still smell it.
Carver: Oh, well, that must have been unpleasant.
Merrill: It was. Did I miss something dirty again?
Carver: No.
───────
Merrill: Do you miss it? Ferelden I mean.
Carver: Sometimes.
Merrill: Blackberries. They don't seem to grow here. And there were little song birds with black caps on their heads.
Carver: I sort of miss the dogs barking.
Merrill: Yes... It's been mostly humans barking at me here. Not nearly as cute.
───────
Merrill: How did you learn swording?
Carver: "Swording"?
Merrill: Those things you do with the sword. It looks tricky. Was it hard to learn?
Carver: It takes a lot of practice.
Merrill: Well, you seem good at it! I bet one day you'll be best sworder in Kirkwall.
Carver: Merrill...
Merrill: I said something wrong again, didn't I? Maybe I'll just stop talking.

Carver and Varric
Varric: You know, Junior, it's eerie how much of a resemblance there is between you two.
Carver:
(If Hawke is male) We're brothers. What's eerie about that?
(If Hawke is female) She's my sister. Of course there's a resemblance.
Varric: Ooh, you thought I meant Hawke. I was talking about Gamlen.
Carver: Maker, I hate you dwarf.
───────

Carver: Don't look at me.
Varric: What's your issue now, little Hawke?
Carver: Don't call me...just don't alright? You're just looking for fodder for your stories.
Varric: You think you're that interesting?
Carver: I have enough trouble being overshadowed as it is. I don't need to get caught under an imaginary me, too.
Varric: Don't you worry. I'm not in the business of lullabies or children's stories.
───────

Carver: I'm surprised these tunnels don't simply collapse.
Varric: Dwarves made them.
Carver: Then I'm surprised they're not smaller.
───────

Varric: You know, Junior, you're looking at this all wrong.
Carver: Whatever it is you're about to say, I'm not interested.
Varric: I'm a professional younger brother. Trust me, the center of attention's the worst place to be.
Varric: When things go wrong, and they always do, that's where all the fingers point. Look at any kingdom in Thedas.
Varric: You've got people who warm thrones, and people nobody sees who do the real work.
Carver:
(If Hawke is male) So my brother is a king now? Just what he needed.
(If Hawke is female) And my sister is a queen in this scenario. Perfect.
Varric: Point. Missing it. Ah well.
───────

Carver: Varric.
Varric: Carver.
Carver: Still think you're helping while burying us in debt to your brother?
Varric: Still riding side-saddle while bitching at your betters?
Carver: Drinks later?
Varric: Never miss'em.

Fenris and Isabela
Act 1
Isabela: So what's with that magical fisting thing you do?
Fenris: I'm... sorry?
Isabela: You know, when you stick your hand into people.
Fenris: Oh. That. Yes. It's a... talent.
Isabela: You could make so much coin with that.
───────
Isabela: This one time, I was sailing to Llomerryn, and there was a fight between two of my men.
Isabela: It was over a dice game, or the last piece of toast, or something. Sailors—they're touchy about their toast.
Fenris: Is this going anywhere?
Isabela: It will if you let me finish.
Isabela: So, there's a knife fight, and Jim ends up with a broken-off blade stuck in his shoulder.
Isabela: It's buried deep in there, and we're out at sea, at least a week from the nearest port.
Isabela: If you were there, you could've reached in and plucked that blade right from his flesh.
Fenris: That's your whole point?
Isabela: Pretty much.
───────
Isabela: I enjoy a man with markings like that.
Fenris: You've enjoyed many, I suspect.
Isabela: Where I come from, they're called "tattoos." Sailors get them all the time.
Fenris: Not made of lyrium, I'd imagine.
Isabela: Not a one. And the pictures are different—usually breasts.
Fenris: I suppose a pair of lyrium breasts tattooed onto my chest would make things better.
Isabela: That's me. I'm a helper.
───────
Fenris: So this relic you mentioned losing...
Isabela: You have pretty eyes.
Fenris: I... have pretty eyes.
Isabela: You elves have such pretty eyes, even the men. It makes me want to pluck them out and wear them as a necklace.
Fenris: I wouldn't suggest trying.
Isabela: Oh, I would never try. Not without reason, of course.
Fenris: Forget I said anything.
───────
Fenris: So you freed a group of slaves?
Isabela: Would-be slaves. They weren't slaves yet.
Fenris: Still, you did the right thing. Many would turn a blind eye.
Isabela: Don't read too much into it, all right? It just seemed a good idea at the time.
───────
Act 2
Fenris: So I hear you think mages should be free.
Isabela: Everyone should be free. Not just mages.
Fenris: Not everyone's dangerous.
Isabela: It's not about who's dangerous. It's about having choices made for you.
Isabela: Don't you wish you had the choice not to have lyrium stuck under your skin?
Fenris: I do.
Isabela: (Sighs) This is silly. I don't want to argue.
Fenris: Do you want to guess what color my underclothes are again?
Isabela: Oh, yes, that's much more fun.
───────
Fenris: You keep staring at me. Is it my eyes again?
Isabela: You're very lanky, for an elf. I like lanky.
Fenris: From what I gather, you like a lot of things.
Isabela: Nonsense. But when I see something I like, I go after it.
(If Hawke is romancing Fenris)

Fenris: I suggest keeping your distance.
Isabela: Now you're just making it challenging.
(Otherwise)

Fenris: Do you intend to go after me, then?
Isabela: Will you take off all that spiky armor you're wearing?
Fenris: It's been known to happen.
Isabela: Then forget it.
───────
Isabela: So what duties did you have? As a slave, I mean?
Fenris: Not this again.
Isabela: I heard that Tevinter slaves are kept oiled so they glisten. Did your master oil you up? Did you glisten for him?
Fenris: I was his bodyguard.
Isabela: Always close at hand. Always within reach. Glistening.
Fenris: You have an entire story written in your head already, don't you?
Isabela: Mmm.
───────
(In front of The Hanged Man)

Fenris: I still don't get the name. Did they hang someone here?
Isabela: It means being drunk.
(If Varric is in the party)

Varric: Actually they used to hang men there. By their feet. Till they starved to death.
Fenris: Well, good thing they were drunk then.
───────
Act 3
Isabela: You seem especially broody today.
Fenris: Does it bother you? Should I stop?
Isabela: No, don't stop. But could you add some smoldering to the routine? Just for me?
Fenris: Smolder?
Isabela: Oh, and while you're at it, perhaps some cold insolence.
Fenris: You want me to smolder and be cold at the same time? Those don't go together...
Isabela: Shush. Don't distract me with your logic.
───────
Fenris: So you engaged a Qunari dreadnaught in battle.
Isabela: They engaged me in battle. I was just trying to get away.
Isabela: Sailing into the storm was a gamble. Took care of the Qunari, but it did us in too. Can't win them all.
Fenris: Where I come from, we would call that insanity.
Isabela: Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
───────
Fenris: I still can't believe Hawke saved you.
Isabela: You've been saying that for years. Would you have turned me over to the Qunari?
Fenris: No, but I know what they do to their prisoners.
Isabela: Execute them horribly, I imagine.
Fenris: The Qunari waste nothing. They would reeducate you into a loyal follower of the Qun.
Isabela: Pfft. Could I refuse?
Fenris: There's always qamek, which turns you into a mindless laborer. Like I said, they waste nothing.
Isabela: Oh.
Fenris: If you wish to thank Hawke, he's/she's standing right there.
───────
(If neither is in a romance with Hawke)

Isabela: That night...I can't stop thinking about it.
Fenris: Well, then I'll see you later.
Isabela: That was direct.
Fenris: I thought I'd get straight to the point. Were you expecting flowers or something?
Isabela: Don't be absurd.
Fenris: Then I'll see you tonight.

Fenris and Merrill
Act 1
Merrill: You've probably never met a Dalish before, have you?
Fenris: I wouldn't know.
Merrill: I'm sure you'd be able to tell. Dalish aren't much like the elves in the cities.
Fenris: The smug sense of superiority does give you away.
───────
Merrill: Certainly your people have stories about the Dalish. No?
Fenris: My people?
Merrill: The elves in Tevinter. They must have heard of us.
Fenris: They've heard. They just don't care.
Merrill: But if they ran away, the Dalish would help them.
Fenris: You might as well say, "If they flew into the sky, they could live in the clouds."
Merrill: What would they eat in the clouds? There's nothing there but fluff and the occasional bird.
Fenris: This is why nobody takes the Dalish seriously.
───────
(After you bring Fenris to the Gallows for the first time)

Fenris: Why are you watching me like that?
Merrill: You have vallaslin. The same markings that the Dalish have.
Fenris: Yours are not made of lyrium.
Merrill: No, they're made of blood. Our blood. That's what vallaslin means: blood writing. It's a mark of adulthood.
Fenris: Mine were carved into my flesh against my will, in a ritual I remember only for the agony it caused me.
Merrill: I'm... so sorry.
───────
Fenris: I don't want your pity.
Merrill: Are you talking to me?
Fenris: You said you were sorry about the ritual I endured. Keep your sorrow.
Merrill: I only meant—
Fenris: You have all the freedom none of our kind enjoy, and you throw it away. On what?
Merrill: Our people need to reclaim their heritage.
Fenris: A heritage of defeat? To what end?
Merrill: Would you truly turn your back on your own history? There's so much we don't know...
Fenris: It's not my history. It's simply history.
───────
Fenris: Tampering around in mud all day, how do the Dalish do it?
Merrill: Do you like the crowded cities better?
Fenris: It's a smell I'm more familiar with, yes.
───────
Act 2
Merrill: You never come to the alienage, Fenris.
Fenris: I don't live in the alienage.
Merrill: Don't you care about the plight of our people? Not even a little bit?
Fenris: I don't need to visit the alienage to know what they suffer. I know it better than you.
Merrill: I've lived there for years! I see it firsthand!
Fenris: And I lived it.
───────
Merrill: Did you step on something sharp, Fenris?
Fenris: No.
Merrill: Slam your fingers in a door?
Fenris: No.
Merrill: Smack your head on a low beam?
Fenris: Is there a point to this line of questioning?
Merrill: Just wondering why you're so cross all the time.
(If Varric is in the party)

Varric: I think he jabs himself with those spikes, personally.
Fenris: Perhaps it's the inane prodding.
───────
(During A Bitter Pill, in the Abandoned Slaver Den, when the Blood Sacrifice is examined)

Fenris: See for yourself. The legacy of the magisters.
Merrill: They sacrifice the unwilling?
Fenris: Is that so hard to believe? You are only a step away from it yourself.
Merrill: That's not true.
Fenris: Believe what you like. In my experience, mages always find a way to justify their need for power.
───────
(After you complete A Bitter Pill)

Fenris: Avert your eyes, witch.
Merrill: You said I was dwelling on "useless" history, but what are you doing?
Merrill: The past is important, to you and to all of us. We must know it to move forward.
Fenris: Yet I have made no deal with a demon to learn of my past.
Fenris: You had a life. You had a family. And you abandoned them to chase after ghosts.
Fenris: We are nothing alike. Don't even begin to think that we are.
───────
(If you complete Mirror Image)

Fenris: You are more naive than I thought.
Merrill: What have I done to you now?
Fenris: To me? Nothing. Not yet.
Fenris: To yourself—you can't even begin to imagine the number of mages that have walked down the path you're now on.
Merrill: My clan didn't believe in me. If you don't believe in me either, I won't mind.
───────
(During Mirror Image)

Merrill: Pol... What was he thinking? ... He acted like I was a monster...
Fenris: You are a monster.
(If Isabela is in the party)

Isabela: You aren't helping.
Fenris: Good.
───────
Act 3
Merrill: Poor Anders.
Fenris: You pity him? He's dangerous to himself and everyone around him.
Merrill: I think he's broken the thing he wanted to save.
Fenris: You pity him because he's you.
Merrill: Breaking the things you love most isn't restricted to mages, Fenris.
Fenris: Sadly true.
───────
Merrill: Your master must have been a terrible man, to make you hate mages so.
(If Alone has been completed)

Fenris: He was, now he's dead.
(Otherwise)

Fenris: He is a terrible man. He's not dead.
Merrill: We're not all like him.
Fenris: How often I hear that, and yet, how often I find it's not true.
Merrill: The Keepers are different. They exist to preserve the old ways, and to protect our people.
Fenris: And none of them would ever fall prey to a demon. Or perform blood magic.
Merrill: It's impossible to talk to you.
───────
(If Hawke is romancing Fenris)

Merrill: (Giggles)
Fenris: What? Why are you looking at me like that?
Merrill: You're in love!
Fenris: I am not.
Merrill: You keep looking at Hawke with sad puppy eyes every time his back is turned. (male Hawke)
Merrill: Everytime she looks away, you stare at Hawke with those sad puppy eyes. (female Hawke)
Fenris: There are no puppy eyes.
Merrill: It's all right, you know. Even you can be happy once in a while. It won't kill you. But your face might crack if you smile, so be careful.
───────
(If Alone & Questioning Beliefs has been completed)

Merrill: Do you regret it? What happened with your sister, I mean.
Fenris: No.
(If Fenris killed Varania)

Merrill: You don't feel bad about killing her? Not even a little?
Fenris: It was necessary.
(Otherwise)

Merrill: You don't wish... that maybe you hadn't found her again?
Fenris: Whatever I wish, it is already done.
Merrill: You're lucky, then. There are so many things I wish I could undo.
───────
(If A New Path has been completed)

Fenris: This... Keeper of yours, she was a friend?
Merrill: She was like a mother to me. To all of us.
Fenris: Then I'm sorry.
Merrill: No you're not. She's just one more mage to you. Why would you be sorry she's dead?
Fenris: I'm not sorry she's dead. I'm only sorry she died for you.
Merrill: What?
Fenris: Let's hope the sacrifice of someone who cared for you that much isn't wasted.

Fenris and Sebastian
Act 2
Sebastian: Are you an Andrastian, Fenris?
Fenris: If I say no, will you attempt to convert me?
Sebastian: Many elves believe in the Maker. I ask only because I wonder if your experiences... soured your faith.
Fenris: My faith was never strong. It's difficult for a slave to have faith in someone who abandoned them.
Sebastian: The Maker didn't enslave you, Fenris.
Fenris: He didn't help me much, either.
Sebastian: And yet you stand here, free. Perhaps He helped you more than you think.
───────
Fenris: The Maker didn't free me.
Sebastian: I see you've been thinking about what I said.
Fenris: I freed myself. If the Maker did anything, He watched. Why should I thank Him for that?
Sebastian: Is it so hard to believe the Maker cares for you? Maybe He gave you the chance to escape.
Fenris: It doesn't feel like the Maker cares for me... or anyone.
Sebastian: We all make our own choices, to do good as well as evil. That is our doing, not the Maker's.
Fenris: Perhaps. It's... been a long time since I gave it any thought.
Sebastian: It's not too late to start.
───────
Sebastian: Were you ever dedicated in the faith of the chantry?
Fenris: I have no memory of my childhood.
Fenris: Danarius had no desire to teach his slaves anything that made them think they're worthy beings.
Sebastian: I'm sorry. I can't imagine how difficult your life has been.
Fenris: No, you can't.
Sebastian: Whether you were taught it or not, the Maker has room at His side for every soul. Even yours.
───────
Sebastian: You know, when I return to Starkhaven you're welcome to come with me.
Fenris: And do what, exactly?
Sebastian: You're a fine warrior. If you could train men to fight like you do, we'd be unstoppable.
Fenris: I'm no leader, and I doubt humans would want me training them.
Sebastian: Then why not train elves? I bet there's plenty who would admire all you've accomplished.
Fenris: I... haven't accomplished anything.
Sebastian: No? You are your own man, living as you see fit—you give yourself too little credit.
Fenris: You are being kind.
Sebastian: Not at all. Think about it.
───────
(Once you complete Repentance)

Sebastian: You know, Fenris, as a brother in the Chantry, I'm allowed to hear confessions.
Fenris: Why would you tell me this?
Sebastian: I know Danarius made you do things. I thought you might be more comfortable talking to a friend.
Sebastian: You should know, a murder committed under duress is a sin on the one who ordered it, not the one whose hands carried out the deed.
Fenris: Have I not spoken enough of my past? Does everyone in Kirkwall wish to hear every sordid detail?
(If Isabela is in the party)

Isabela: I know I do.
Sebastian: Sometimes, it's painful to speak. But it's the only way the wound can be lanced.
───────
Act 3
Sebastian: I saw you at the Chantry last week, Fenris, but I haven't seen you back since.
Fenris: I was only delivering something: you needn't concern yourself.
Sebastian: But you were praying. Or was that part of the delivery?
Fenris: I was... trying to blend in.
Sebastian: (Laughs) Oh, yes! You wouldn't want to ruin your reputation.
Fenris: Don't you have a city to re-conquer?
───────
Fenris: Terrible things do happen, Sebastian.
Sebastian: But what we see is only a piece of the puzzle. Only the Maker can see the greater picture.
Fenris: The guilty prosper. Innocents die.
Sebastian: And then they are brought to the side of the Maker. Their suffering ends. There is always a greater purpose.
Fenris: Danarius once killed a little boy to fuel blood magic that let him impress his fellow Senators at a party. What was the purpose there?
Sebastian: Perhaps it was witnessing that which will give you the strength to prevent it ever happening again.
───────
Sebastian: It's our duty to tell the templars.
Fenris: Then why haven't you done it?
Sebastian: I guess I was hoping they'd come to it on their own.
Fenris: And then you wouldn't have to betray Hawke's friends, right?
Sebastian: That's not reason enough to allow a maleficar to walk free.
(If Anders is in the party)

Anders: You think the templars don't know I'm here? They just haven't caught me yet.
(If Merrill is in the party)

Merrill: Are you talking about me?
Sebastian: Which of us should do it? Shall we draw lots?
Fenris: Uh-uh. You want to turn them in, you work it out with Hawke.
───────
(If Faith has been completed)

Fenris: So that's it? You're not returning to Starkhaven now?
Sebastian: There are greater things that need to be done, Fenris.
Fenris: And what about avenging your family? Does that not need to be done?
Sebastian: What has my vengeance accomplished except to spill more blood?
Sebastian: No, I must put my faith in the Maker. He will set my path before me.
Fenris: I can't decide if it is certainty you have, or blindness.
Sebastian: (Chuckles) At least you can't decide.

Fenris and Varric
Act 1
Fenris: I thought all dwarves had beards. Where's yours?
Varric: I misplaced it, along with my sense of dwarven pride and my gold-plated noble caste pin.
Fenris: I thought maybe it fell onto your chest.
Varric: Oh-ho! The broody elf tells a joke!
Fenris: I don't brood.
Varric: Friend, if your brooding were any more impressive, women would swoon as you passed. They'd have broody babies in your honor.
Fenris: You're a very odd dwarf.
Varric: And you thought I was joking about the pin.
───────
Varric: So where's your beard, elf?
Fenris: Elves don't grow beards.
Varric: Huh. I thought maybe you'd shaved it off in a fit of broody pique.
Fenris: So you're a funny dwarf.
───────
Varric: So, elf. That thing you do with your hand...
Fenris: I can already tell this isn't going anywhere pleasant.
Varric: I bet that makes pickpocketing easier.
Fenris: I'll try it some time and find out.
───────
Varric: Is brooding a sport in Tevinter? Do they hold competitions? Hand out trophies for the best scowls?
Fenris: I'm not "brooding."
Varric: Moping, then. You seem like you're a champion at it.
Fenris: I'm perfectly content at the moment.
Varric: Oh, so that's you smiling? Glad you clarified that. I'd never have known.
───────
Act 2
Varric: You know, if you need advice on how to lay low I can give you some.
Fenris: Being short would make for an excellent start, I suspect.
Varric: Keep that up, serah, and you can keep on hiding like a rank amateur.
Fenris: What would you suggest, Varric? Cower in the shadows like a rat?
Varric: You could try wearing something that didn't scream: "I hate you all, I was a slave!"
Fenris: The markings would still show.
Varric: Really? Through anything? That's... kind of cool.
───────
Varric: You really ought to take that offer, elf. It would keep the Coterie off your back pretty much permanently.
Fenris: I don't need employment.
Varric: But it wouldn't kill you to make some friends in this city. Three years, and you're practically a ghost.
Fenris: I prefer it that way.
Varric: Healthy attitude there. Forget I said anything.
───────
Varric: So what do you do in that gigantic house all day?
Fenris: Dance, of course.
Varric: Really?
Fenris: I run from room to room, choreographing routines.
Varric: You're actually joking. Alert the Chantry! They need to put this on the calendar!
Fenris: And you thought I was always serious.
───────
(If you complete Family Matter)

Fenris: So you found your brother.
Varric: I did! Wasn't expecting that.
Fenris: I assume there was a time when you and he were friends?
Varric: With Bartrand? No, just brothers. Occasionally he wasn't insufferable.
Fenris: And yet you remained at his side.
Varric: Too bad he didn't do the same.
───────
(In front of The Hanged Man)

Fenris: I still don't get the name. Did they hang someone here?
(If Isabela is in the party)

Isabela: It means being drunk.
(If Anders is in the party)

Anders: Someone is "hung" if they are drunk, I believe.
Varric: Actually they used to hang men there. By their feet.
Fenris: Well, good thing they were drunk then.
───────
Act 3
Fenris: So who is "Bianca"?
Varric: My crossbow. Say hello, Bianca.
Fenris: But why Bianca? You must have named her after someone.
Varric: Nope. Mirabelle was taken.
Fenris: The way you fondle your weapon is disturbing.
Varric: Hey! I'm a perfect gentleman. In public.
───────
Fenris: I notice you hardly ever comment on mages and templars and such.
Varric: It's a lot of humans in skirts. I get them mixed up.
Fenris: I highly doubt that. The subject comes up all the time.
Varric: Tell me about it.
Fenris: And no opinion? One way or the other?
Varric: Opinions are like testicles. You kick them hard enough, doesn't matter how many you got.
Fenris: That's... something.
───────
Varric: You know you still owe me five sovereigns, elf.
Fenris: I'm good for it.
(If Isabela did not leave the party)

Varric: So, you think you can win the coin from Isabela? Good luck with that.
(Otherwise)

Varric: Meaning you'll borrow it from Hawke, probably.
Varric: Coming to the Hanged Man for Wicked Grace later?
Fenris: Never miss it.
───────
(If Hawke romanced Fenris)

Varric: So...you and Hawke?
Fenris: What about us?
(If Hawke is female)

Varric: I want to make sure I get all the details right when I tell this story. Did you sweep her off her feet or was it the other way around?
(If Hawke is male)

Varric: I want to make sure I get all the details right when I tell this story. Did he sweep you off your feet? I'm assuming he did the sweeping. He's taller than you. Awkward, otherwise.
Fenris: I'm not telling you anything but this: There was no actual sweeping involved.
Varric: Every little bit helps, elf.

Isabela and Merrill
Act 1
Merrill: How do you do that?
Isabela: Do what, Kitten?
Merrill: You sort of... swagger when you walk. I've been trying, but I trip over my own feet when I do it.
Isabela: You just strut. It's not something you practice.
Merrill: How do I learn it, then?
Isabela: It comes to you. Usually at night. It's like a lover... or maybe a burglar.
Isabela: Either it ravishes you or runs off with all your jewelry. And you have to run it down and stab it in the heart.
Isabela: And... that metaphor got a bit away from me, didn't it?
Merrill: I think it did, but it was certainly exciting!
───────
Merrill: Do you really like sailing?
Isabela: Like it? I love it! The salt spray on my face, the wind whipping by my ears, the gulls screaming overhead—I love it all.
Merrill: Don't you get sick? I was so sick on our trip across the sea.
Isabela: Were you in the hold?
Merrill: Everyone was in the hold.
Isabela: There's your problem. You need to be up on deck, under the sky, with nothing between you and the horizon.
Isabela: Sailing is like sex. Do it wrong, and it'll make you sick.
Isabela: But do it right, and there's no feeling in the world like it.
───────
Merrill: Do you have a parrot, Isabela?
Isabela: What would I want a parrot for?
Merrill: What about a peg leg? Do you have one of those?
Isabela: You can see that I don't, dear.
Merrill: Eye patch?
Isabela: I'm disappointing you terribly, aren't I? And no hook for a hand, either.
Merrill: Seems that Varric's pirate stories are awfully inaccurate.
Isabela: He knows, Kitten. He likes them better that way.
───────
Isabela: It's not always fun and games on the sea, though. There are storms and hostile pirates.
Isabela: And it's trying being cooped up with men who haven't seen a woman in months.
Merrill: You're a woman.
Isabela: Exactly. And I don't usually let them touch me, so they get... frustrated.
Isabela: I insist all of them get alone time. Helps with the crankiness.
Merrill: But they're already lonely! Why would you insist that they be alone some more?
Isabela: Merrill.
Merrill: What? Did I miss something?
Isabela: Go think about it. Maybe it'll come to you.
───────
(While speaking to Jethann in The Blooming Rose during the quest The First Sacrifice)

Isabela: Ooh, I like him. He reminds me of someone.
Merrill: He does? Who is it?
(If Varric is in the party)

Varric: I'll tell you when you're older, Daisy.
Isabela: Think about it, Kitten.
Merrill: Well, you couldn't have meant Varric, because he's not even an elf—oh... Ohh! You were referring to yourself. Sorry!
Isabela: See? I knew it'd come to you.
───────
Act 2
Merrill: (Sighs) Why do you even like me? I must seem so dull.
Isabela: What brought this on?
Merrill: Your life has been... so exciting. The adventures, the duels, the passionate love affairs.
Merrill: Compared to that, my life is a stale, dry biscuit. (Sighs) I wish I had your life.
Isabela: No. You don't want my life.
Merrill: Why?
Isabela: Because you have a good heart, and you deserve better.
───────
Merrill: What was Llomerryn like? I've never heard of a Dalish who's been there.
Isabela: I don't imagine your people travel between islands much.
Merrill: Not really, no.
Isabela: I wouldn't start waterproofing your wagons, then. I don't think Llomerryn is ready for the Dalish.
Merrill: What do you mean? Would we upset the people there?
Isabela: It's not really the kind of place where one turns down a tumble. Even refuse a fortune teller, and they'd run your lot out of town.
───────
Merrill: How do you suppose the Qunari scratch their heads with those horns in the way?
Isabela: Why do you think I would know?
Merrill: Because you know lots of things! I wonder if they rub their heads against tree trunks like halla do.
Isabela: I'd pay a sovereign to see that.
Merrill: No wonder they seem so cranky all the time.
───────
Merrill: You've had many lovers, haven't you?
Isabela: Fewer than some think.
Merrill: But you never stay with them.
Isabela: No, why should I?
Merrill: But the act of lovemaking is so... intimate.
Isabela: I don't "make love." What I do is only skin-deep, Kitten.
Isabela: Don't worry your pretty little head about it.
───────
(If Hawke is romancing Merrill)

Isabela: You and Hawke... something's there, isn't there?
Merrill: He's clever, strong, and wonderful. How can anyone not love him?
Merrill: She's so amazing and beautiful. How could anyone not love her? (if Hawke is female)
(If Hawke also romanced Isabela:)

Isabela: How could anyone not?
Merrill: You're very quiet today. Is something wrong?
Merrill: (Gasps) It's me. I said something wrong, didn't I?
Isabela: No, of course not. You could never say anything wrong.
Isabela: I'm happy for you, Kitten. You've been alone long enough.
(Otherwise)

Isabela: Oh, I could give you a list, but that might just bore you.
Isabela: So... did you get naked?
Merrill: Isabela!
Isabela: Ooh, look at that blush. That good, huh?
───────
Act 3
(If Hawke has accepted Isabela's love)

Merrill: I think Hawke likes you, Isabela
Isabela: I certainly hope so!
Merrill: Of course, it's not surprising at all that anybody would love you, but it's nice to see you two happy.
Isabela: Merrill, sometimes you're so sweet I could eat you for dessert.
───────
(If Hawke hasn't accepted her love yet)

Merrill: I think Hawke likes you, Isabela.
Isabela: You think so, do you?
Merrill: S/he looks at you all the time, and then s/he looks embarrassed and pretends s/he's busy with something else.
Hawke: I can hear you, you know.
Merrill: (Giggles) See?
Isabela: Hmm. I'll have to think about that...
───────
Merrill: Do you think you'll leave Kirkwall someday?
(If Hawke has romanced Isabela)

Isabela: I might if I can persuade the right person to come away with me.
(If not)

Isabela: Of course I will! As soon as I get myself a ship, I'm sailing wherever the sea takes me.
Merrill: I'll miss you. You'll write to me, won't you? Do pirates write letters?
Isabela: Badly. Hook hands make for awful pennmanship, Kitten.
───────
(If No Rest for the Wicked & Questioning Beliefs have been completed and Hawke accepted Isabela's love)

Merrill: Why are you smiling?
Isabela: No reason.
Merrill: Ooh, ooh! It's something dirty, isn't it? Tell me, tell me!
Isabela: It... it isn't anything dirty. I'm just... happy.
Merrill: Oh. That's good, too, but I was hoping for something dirty.
Isabela: Come by the tavern later. I've got stories that will make your toes curl.

Isabela and Sebastian
Act 2
Sebastian: Is this getting you any closer to your ship?
Isabela: Huh?
Sebastian: I just... don't understand why you're working with Hawke. You don't seem to care about anything we do.
Sebastian: What's keeping you here?
(If Hawke and Isabela have slept together)

Isabela: Mostly the sex. Hawke is an absolute tiger between the sheets. I mean all night, every night.
Isabela: Oh cute! You're blushing.
(If not)

Isabela: Mostly the Blooming Rose. I'm paid up through the end of the year. I'd hate not to use it.
Sebastian: The... brothel?
Isabela: What? Women can't go to brothels, too? You're just not using your imagination.
Isabela: Oh, look! Now you are. You're cute when you're blushing.
───────
Sebastian: I notice you talk about... vulgar things quite a bit.
Isabela: Do you want me to stop? Do I make you... uncomfortable?
Sebastian: It was just an observation, really.
Isabela: It's a bad habit I picked up, spending years with foul-mouthed pirates.
Isabela: Pirates only care about a small number of very specific things: the sea, strong drink, and booty. Both kinds.
───────
Sebastian: I used to be like you, you know.
Isabela: You used to be a woman?
Sebastian: No!
Isabela: That explains a lot.
Sebastian: My family put me in the Chantry because I was giving them a bad name.
Sebastian: It was the best thing that ever happened to me. I found peace. I found a purpose.
Sebastian: Before I came here, I used to be out to all hours, drinking and whoring. I didn't believe in anything except my own pleasure.
Isabela: Why couldn't I have met you then?
───────
Isabela: All right, let's just get this over with.
Sebastian: A duel?
Isabela: No, the sermon. The finger-wagging, the guilt-trips, telling me how an unexamined life isn't worth living.
Sebastian: I wasn't going to—
Isabela: You weren't? You weren't going to tell me to comfort the needy and give freely of myself?
Sebastian: From what I hear, you already give yourself quite freely.
Isabela: Ooh. You got me there.
───────
Act 3

Sebastian: That was very brave, coming back to face the Qunari.
Isabela: It was idiotic. They would have killed me.
Sebastian: And you returned anyway. You couldn't face the thought of so many innocents dying for something you could prevent.
Isabela: Tell that to the viscount.
Sebastian: It's frightening, isn't it, to realize you have the potential to be a better person?
───────
Sebastian: You've been watching me all day. It's getting a little... distracting.
Isabela: Merrill's right. Your armor is shiny. I can see myself in it. Look!
Isabela: Shit. Oh, shit. Is that a wrinkle? Is that a wrinkle between my brows?
Sebastian: Um. I don't see—
Isabela: Hold still!
───────
Isabela: So, I've never understood why the Chantry says if you're good, you'll be taken up to the Maker's side.
Sebastian: Those who die with the sins cleansed from their souls will walk beside the Maker in eternity.
Isabela: That doesn't sound fun!
Isabela: If they really want people to be good, shouldn't they offer an afterlife with... lakes of wine and a dozen naked virgins?
Sebastian: Anyone who wants that will be going to the Void.
Isabela: Sounds like that's where all the good parties will be.
───────
Isabela: It's been years, and not once have you tried to get me to repent or turn to the Maker.
Sebastian: Preaching seldom works, Isabela. To change a person's heart, one has to lead by example.
Isabela: Huh. That makes sense. I can respect that.
Sebastian: I grew weary of the strings of nameless lovers and the nights full of mindless pleasure. You will, too.
Isabela: (Gasps) That's the cruelest thing anyone's ever said to me!
Isabela: I think I'm going to cry.

Isabela and Varric
Act 1

Varric: I shit you not, Rivaini, it was this big.
Isabela: There's no way. Impossible! I've had hundreds of those in my hands, and they're never that size.
Varric: Would I lie about something so critical?
(Next line is dependent on third party member)

Anders: I can't stand it anymore—what are you two talking about?
Aveline: I'm afraid to ask, but... what are you two going on about?
Carver: What is wrong with you two? Can't you ever have a conversation that isn't dirty?
Hawke: What are you two talking about?
Varric: We're discussing knives, of course. Well, daggers, technically. I never remember the difference.
Varric: Why? What did you think we were talking about?
───────
Varric: Rivaini, stop looking at my chest. My eyes are up here.
Isabela: But the chest hair...
Varric: Do you know how much I suffer under your gaze? I am a person, not an object!
Isabela: Uh, Varric?
Varric: (Laughs) Just shitting you.
───────
Varric: You know, Rivaini, you promised me you'd tell me how your ship wrecked.
Isabela: I was drunk. I thought the reefs around the Wounded Coast were made of candy.
Varric: Oh, come on.
Isabela: And a demon told me to do it. It bet me sixty sovereigns and a bottle of port.
Isabela: You're not the only one here who can bullshit, you know.
───────
Varric: I'll let you run your fingers through it, if you want.
Isabela: Your chest hair? My fingers? Oh, Varric, stop! You're making me quiver.
Varric: You know you want to.
Isabela: Oh, I do... I can't resist you. No woman can.
Varric: I know. It's a terrible burden.
───────
Act 2

Varric: Were you listening to that guy in the Hanged Man last night?
Isabela: "Your eyes are like bumblebees, flying into the window of my soul." (Laughs)
Varric: My favorite was, "Your lips are like the wings of sparrows. Red ones. With no feathers."
Isabela: "Oh, speak! And send the plucked wings of your lips soaring."
Varric: I'd buy the guy a drink, but I don't think he needs one.
───────
Varric: You have got to tell me what was in that box, Rivaini.
Isabela: Which box? I've opened so many...
Varric: Well, those too. But later. Right now: that Qunari relic.
Isabela: I'll make you a deal: I'll tell you what was in that box if you tell me how Bianca got her name.
Varric: Fine, forget I asked. Evil woman.
───────
Isabela: Come to me, and I'll take you to places you've never been...
Varric: Isabela... Are you talking to Bianca?
Isabela: I think she deserves to feel a woman's touch on her trigger, don't you?
Varric: Bianca responds to my touch. She'd never give it up for you.
Isabela: That's what they always say, and I always prove them wrong.
Varric: Stop it. You're confusing her. And me.
───────
(If you complete The Long Road)

Isabela: Psst. I've got some of it written down now.
Varric: Give it here.
Varric: "Her breasts strained against the leather jerkin like two wild stallions corralled against their will." (Chuckles)
Varric: "She pounced—the smooth moves of a jungle cat—and locked her thighs around Donnic's waist. He—"
(If Aveline is in the party)

Aveline: What?
Isabela: Nothing.
Aveline: What is that?
Isabela: Shh! (Giggles)
Varric: Isabela just thought she'd celebrate your love affair with a... written dedication.
Isabela: It's "friend-fiction!" I do it out of love.
Aveline: I will never, ever be clean again.
(If not)

Isabela: Maybe you should read the rest of it in private.
Varric: I think that's best.
───────
Act 3

Isabela: Varric, how does one get made a Paragon?
Varric: The Assembly votes on it. Enough votes, and—BAM!—you're a living God!
Isabela: You should ask to be made a Paragon. Of manliness.
Varric: I like the way you think, Rivaini, but one doesn't just ask to be made a Paragon.
Isabela: Why not? Everyone can see you're a paragon of manliness. It's just a matter of making it official.
───────
Varric: After all this, the life of a pirate is going to be dull, isn't it?
Isabela: I know! I'll have to steal myself another Qunari relic.
Varric: The scary thing is, I don't know if you're joking!
Isabela: Of course I'm joking. I'm not getting involved with those people again.
Isabela: No... this time, I'll steal the Queen of Antiva. There's no way that could go wrong.
───────
(If Hawke romances Merrill)

Varric: So, Hawke and Daisy.
Isabela: I think they're darling together.
(If Hawke previously slept with Isabela)

Varric: Really? You're not at all jealous? Because I thought you and Hawke...
Isabela: Hawke was just a dalliance. You know I've still got my eye on you.
Varric: Keep dreaming, Rivaini.
(Otherwise)

Varric: It's almost too adorable. Well, except for the evil blood magic thing.
Isabela: The most evil thing Merrill does most days is pick the flowers out of other people's gardens.
Varric: I know, I have to bribe most of the gardeners in Hightown to keep it quiet.
───────
(During The Last Straw after choosing sides)

Varric: Just curious, does any of this make sense to you?
Isabela: What? This whole "everyone's waiting for the world to end" thing?
Varric: That, yes.
Isabela: Not remotely.
Varric: Good. It's not just me, then.

Merrill and Sebastian
Act 2

Sebastian: Have you heard the Chant of Light?
Merrill: That's the song they sing at the Chantry, right? It's pretty... but a little repetitive.
Sebastian: Then you know the story? How Andraste became the Maker's divine bride and convinced Him to offer us a second chance?
Merrill: Right. But I never understood why she had to die.
Sebastian: Her mortal husband betrayed her out of jealousy.
Merrill: But if He wanted her to spread her faith, couldn't she do that better alive?
Sebastian: The Maker gave us free will. By his betrayal, Maferath showed us that men were not yet worth saving.
Merrill: I don't know. It's a nice story, but I think it's got some holes.
───────
Merrill: Your armor is very shiny, Sebastian. Doesn't that make you an easier target?
Sebastian: The Light of the Maker is my armor, Merrill. I am not afraid.
Merrill: Maybe you could ask Him to make His Light less shiny? Then you wouldn't need as much armor.
───────
Merrill: If your city was stolen, why didn't you just call the guards?
Sebastian: I'm afraid the matter can't be handled by guards, Merrill.
Merrill: Aveline could help you! She's very good at making thieves give things back. I think it's because she's so tall.
Sebastian: This is beyond even Aveline's power, I'm sorry to say.
Merrill: Are you sure? Have you seen her hit people?
(If Aveline is in the party)

Aveline: I can hear every word you're saying.
───────
Sebastian: So what do you believe, Merrill?
Merrill: Our gods abandoned us long ago. They haven't answered our prayers since the fall of Arlathan.
Merrill: When we've proven that we're elves again, that we didn't lose everything, they'll come back to us.
Sebastian: We say the same of the Maker.
Sebastian: Perhaps they're only different names for the same divine force that created the world.
Merrill: The Maker wants you to be elves?
───────
Act 3

Merrill: I've always wondered: how do your Divines choose their names?
Sebastian: They write all the best sacred names on slips of paper and stuff them in a miter.
Sebastian: Then the newly elected Divine picks a name out of the hat.
Merrill: What if she picks a name she doesn't like? Does she have to keep it?
Sebastian: Of course she does. How do you think we got four Divines named Hortensia?
───────
Merrill: Does your bow have a name? Varric's bow has a name.
Sebastian: I'm afraid I can't compete with our dear dwarf's... relationship to his weapon.
Merrill: You could call it Philomela!
Sebastian: Why would I do that?
Merrill: Because it reminds me of a woman in the alienage. Skinny, pointed, and always throwing things at people.
───────
Merrill: What does your Chantry do?
Merrill: I mean, you keep saying how great it is. Anders and Isabela tell me to stay away from it. But what does it do?
Merrill: Among the Dalish, the Keepers teach the children, preserve our history, perform magic. The priestesses here just... sing.
Sebastian: The Chantry does many charitable works. It cares for widows and orphans—
Merrill: Who in the Dalish would just be part of the clan, like everyone else.
Merrill: I just don't get it.
───────
(After completing A New Path)

Sebastian: You need to seek atonement.
Merrill: I know I should've died there, not Marethari. Don't you think I feel guilty enough?
Sebastian: Guilt isn't a punishment. It's a reminder of the things you haven't set right.
Sebastian: The only way to shed its burden is to repent with a sincere heart and to rectify your failings.
Merrill: But how?
Merrill: The Keeper is dead, my clan lost everything because of me.
Merrill: There's not enough I can do in this lifetime to make up for that.
Sebastian: It was your pride that led you to the demon. Admitting what you can't do is a good first step.

Merrill and Varric
Act 1

Merrill: I've never met a dwarf before.
Varric: That's because you spend too much time frolicking in the woods, Daisy. Dwarves don't frolic.
Merrill: Dalish don't really frolic, either. Not in the woods anyway.
Varric: You have sanctioned frolicking areas?
Merrill: No, just not in the woods. The trees get jealous.
Varric: But you do frolic?
Merrill: Of course we do! We wouldn't be elves, otherwise.
───────

Merrill: You remind me of Hahren Paivel, Varric. Only younger. And shorter. And not as serious.
Varric: So it's a close resemblance, then.
Merrill: Well, he tells stories. And you tell stories. Although none of his begin, "No shit, there I was."
Varric: I'll have to give him some better stories, then.
───────

(After you speak to Merrill in her home for the first time)

Merrill: Thank you very much for the help earlier, Varric!
Varric: You made it back to the Alienage in one piece, then?
Merrill: I don't know how I wound up in Darktown. There are just too many corners in Kirkwall.
Varric: Still got that ball of twine?
Merrill: I left it at my house. Don't worry! I won't get lost while we're following Hawke.
Varric: Bring it next time, Daisy. Just in case.
───────

Varric: Daisy, for my sake, please quit cutting through the alleys in Lowtown alone at night.
Merrill: Nothing ever happens. I'm perfectly safe, Varric.
Varric: Yes, I know. And that nothing is costing me a fortune.
───────

Act 2

Varric: So, I hear you've been visiting the viscount's garden, Daisy.
Merrill: They're enormous! And they're always empty. Why don't more people go to see them?
Varric: Probably because they're private and surrounded by guards.
Merrill: I thought all those men looked a bit cross.
───────

Merrill: Bianca is a very pretty name.
Varric: I'll tell her you said so, Daisy.
Merrill: She can't actually hear you, can she?
Varric: Of course she can. What kind of a question is that?
Merrill: Wait, are we talking about your crossbow or something else now?
───────

(If you complete Family Matter)

Merrill: I'm sorry about your brother, Varric. Have you any other family?
Varric: (Snorts) I have family like a rat has fleas, Daisy.
Merrill: Does that mean you have a lot of family, or that they make you itch a lot?
Varric: Both.
(Alternatively)

Varric: I'm sure any priest who would pray for Bartrand would burst into flames.
Merrill: Oh, I didn't know priesthood was so dangerous.
Varric: Don't worry Daisy, the chantry keeps a lot of water on hand.
───────

(If you complete Mirror Image)

Varric: Why a mirror?
Merrill: I don't understand the question.
Varric: If your people were going to make a magical whatever for talking to each other, why choose a mirror?
Varric: Do elves spend a lot of time talking to their own reflections?
Merrill: I suppose the ancient elves would have felt silly talking to a wardrobe or an urn.
───────

(If Isabela is gone at the end of Act 2)

Merrill: Do you ever miss her?
Varric: Isabela? Of course I do.
Merrill: You call her by her name! I've never heard you do that before.
Varric: No fun in calling her Rivaini if she's not here to be annoyed by it.
───────

Act 3

Merrill: You should have this back.
Varric: Twine? When did I loan you a ball of twine?
Merrill: You gave it to me when I first moved here when I kept getting lost in Lowtown.
Merrill: It drove the merchants in the market completely batty, but it did help me find my way.
Varric: Keep it, Daisy.
Merrill: I don't think I'll be getting lost again anytime soon.
Varric: You never know. You might need to tie a package up, hang a lantern, dress a roast chicken. It's multipurpose.
───────

Merrill: Is there a story behind Bianca?
Varric: There's a story behind everything, Daisy.
Merrill: So tell me!
Varric: I can't.
Merrill: Why not?
Varric: There was a girl, and I made a promise. Bianca is the only story I can never tell.
Merrill: You can't say that! Now I want to know even more!
Varric: That was the idea, Daisy.
───────

(During A New Path)

Varric: Does anybody else get the feeling that this is going to end badly? Just me huh?
Merrill: It's not all bad Varric, think of the stories you'll be able to tell later.
Varric: No offense Daisy, but I could live without telling anyone that we murdered you on some mountain side, it's little hard to made that one sound good.
───────

(During A New Path)

Varric: Who thought putting a demon in a cave on Sundermount was a good idea in the first place?
Merrill: Where would you have put him?
Varric: Tevinter maybe? Or in the Anderfels? Further away from Kirkwall that's for sure.
───────


Merrill: How do you do it, living in the city without picking a side? Doesn't it matter to you?
Varric: Of course it does. That's why I don't take sides.
Merrill: That doesn't make any sense.
Varric: I've got you and Aveline, Fenris and Anders. Hawke. Isabela.
Varric: I've got friends in the Circle and drinking buddies in the templars. All of them matter.
Merrill: But you're going to fight. If it comes to that, I mean.
Varric: I fought my own brother, Daisy. Nobody said this was going to be happy story.
───────

(During The Last Straw)

Merrill: Varric, how does the story end?
Varric: Which story, Daisy?
Merrill: The big one. With us and Hawke, the mages and templars. Everything.
Varric: You want to know before it happens? You're not worried about spoiling the surprise?
Merrill: I might not see it end.
Varric: You have to stick with us if you want to find out how it turns out, Daisy.

Sebastian and Varric
Act 2

Sebastian: It's been very exciting working with Hawke.
Varric: Are you for real?
Sebastian:
(If Hawke is male) It seems like he's involved every time there's a crisis in Kirkwall.
(If Hawke is female) It seems like she's involved every time something goes wrong in Kirkwall.
Sebastian: I've never had so many opportunities to help people!
Varric: All right. I thought I was getting tired of moody. I take it back.
Varric: You're making my teeth ache.
───────

Varric: So, Choir Boy, this usurper of yours is... twenty feet tall?
Sebastian: Not even close, no.
Varric: But he has claws for hands, right?
Sebastian: Fingers. Perfectly normal ones. If a little fat, perhaps.
Varric: He eats babies, though. And farts fire.
Sebastian: You're not serious, I hope.
Varric: You can't even pretend to be interesting, can you?
───────

Sebastian: You must forgive your brother.
Varric: While you were off playing prince, Bartrand trapped us in the Deep Roads and left us to die.
Sebastian: When you hold onto anger, it colors everything you do.
Sebastian: You escaped the Deep Roads. You built a life without your brother. Do you still want him haunting you?
Varric: Oh, go find some beggars to sing to, will you?
───────

Varric: Tell us about Starkhaven, Choir Boy. I'm sure we're all burning with curiosity about your far-away land.
Sebastian: "My far-away land?" It's inland Free Marches, not on the moon.
Varric: And here I was hoping...
Sebastian: It's a lot like here. But fewer dead people.
Varric: Well, you don't have Hawke.
───────

Act 3

Varric: I've heard rumors about Starkhaven, you know.
Varric: They say you eat the dead up there. And murder strangers in the street.
Sebastian: Why do I suspect that when you say you've "heard" rumors, you mean you've invented some?
Varric: Six of one, half-dozen of another.
───────

Varric: You know, Choir Boy, I wouldn't normally say this, but—the shiny white armor? It works for you.
Sebastian: That's uncharacteristically kind of you, Varric.
Varric: Makes you look like a lacquered pilot whale.
Sebastian: Ah, now that was much more in-character.
───────

Sebastian: You know, if you have time, I could give you a few archery pointers.
Varric: Excuse me?
Sebastian: Sometimes your shots veer a little left, I thought maybe your cocking ring was off.
Sebastian: I could take a look if you like.
Varric: You want to touch Bianca's cocking ring?
Sebastian: It was just a thought.
───────

Varric: So, I've known you for three years now. I give up. You beat me. What is it?
Varric: You like boys? Sheep? You slept with your sister?
Sebastian: What are you talking about?
Varric: What are you hiding? Nobody's this bloody clean.
Varric: After you leave the chantry you... get drunk at the Hanged Man and walk around in women's clothes?
(If Isabela is in the party)

Isabela: Not that I've seen. Unfortunately.
Sebastian: I've been honest with you and Hawke.
Varric: Liar.
Sebastian: Lying is a sin.
