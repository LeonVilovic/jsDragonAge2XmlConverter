Anders and Aveline
Act 1
 Aveline: I hear good things about you, Anders. Not what I expected. 6160605
 Anders: From a mage, you mean. 6160608
 Aveline: I didn't say that. 6128984
 Anders: How else would you judge me? What else am I a shining example of? 6160614
 Aveline: I don't know... other Fereldans lurking in Darktown? Mage or not. 6160617
 Anders: You... have a fair point. 6160620
───────
  Anders: So you married a templar, huh? 6136325
  Aveline: What of it? 6153967
  Anders: Are they all as dirty as they seem? 6153970
  Aveline: What? 6015974
  Anders: Did he ever ask you to play "the naughty mage and the helpless recruit?" Maybe the "secret desire demon and the upstanding knight?"
  Aveline: That's disgusting! 6153979
  Anders: I hear it's quite popular. 6153982
───────
 Aveline: I could use your consult Anders.
 Anders: Bring it to Darktown, and I'll get you a salve or something. 6160627
 Aveline: What? No! I need to know some things about mages. 6160630
 Anders: Why? 6062818
 Aveline: I'm a guard. I'm the first person who has to deal with... trouble. 6160636
 Anders: You want help killing people like me. 6160639
 Aveline: Not every mage can be trusted. 6160642
 Anders: Nor every guard. 6160645
───────
 Anders: Do you ever miss Ferelden? 6136326
 Aveline: Of course! It was home. I would never have left willingly. 6153985
 Aveline: But I'm not going to be my father and spend my life trying to live a memory. 6153988
 Anders: I didn't think I'd give it a second thought once I was gone. I mean, what did Ferelden ever do for me? 6153991
 Anders: But I do. I think about it. There's something here that just doesn't feel right. 6153994
 Aveline: You mean how mages are treated? 6153997
 Anders: No... I think there's not enough dog shit. 6154000
───────
Act 2
 Aveline: You're glaring, Anders. Is there a reason, or is it one of your moods? 6160649
 Anders: Your term as captain hasn't been particularly "mage friendly."
 Aveline: I've only turned a handful over to the templars. 6160655
 Anders: Every despot starts somewhere. 6160658
 Aveline: And yet I allow an abomination to whine at me! Credit where it's due. 6160661
───────
 Aveline: So you're two people, Anders and... Justice? 6160665
 Anders: That's not strictly accurate. 6160668
 Aveline: But you are of two minds. 6160671
 Anders: Many people are. 6160674
 Aveline: Now you're the one not being accurate. 6160677
 Anders: I thought those were the rules of this game. 6160680
 Aveline: I never know who I'm talking to with you. 6160683
 Anders: Then it's fortunate it doesn't occur often. 6160686
───────
  Anders: So, I never expected to be palling around with the captain of the guard. 6136327
  Aveline: We're not "pals."
  Anders: We're not? What about that time we painted each other's toenails? 6154006
  Aveline: Do you want something? 6154009
  Anders: Love, life, and liberty. What more does a man need? 6154012
  Aveline: You're in a jolly mood. 6154015
  Anders: Well, when you're here, I know you're not leading men into Darktown to arrest me. 6154018
───────
(If Ella was killed during Dissent)

  Anders: Can I ask you something, Aveline? 6136328
  Aveline: I cannot look the other way when mages break the law--
  Anders: That's not what I was going to ask. 6154024
  Anders: There's a girl. A mage apprentice. She...was murdered in the Gallows recently. Have you heard anything of it?
  Aveline: You mean the girl you killed. 6154030
  Anders: Yes. I'd like to... attend the funeral. Do something. 6154033
  Aveline: The official templar report says she was killed by a demon of unknown origin. 6154036
  Aveline: Let her family mourn in peace. 6154039
───────
Act 3
  Anders: I suppose you're just thrilled how the knight-commander's basically stepped into the viscount's seat? 6136329
  Aveline: She can't stall the process forever. It's not her place. 6154042
*  Aveline: Leaving the viscount's seat empty will just tempt people to fight for it. It will cause more trouble than it prevents. 6154045
  Anders: Well. You've got a brain in there after all. 6154048
  Anders: I was convinced that headband was to keep it from falling out. 6154051
───────
 Aveline: I have to admit, Anders. Of the mages I know, you're the one I expected to go out in a blaze. 6160690
 Anders: The day is young. 6160693
 Aveline: It was a compliment, you ass. 6160696
 Anders: No, it wasn't. 6160699
───────
  Anders: Your husband agrees with me. 6136330
  Aveline: About what? 6154054
  Anders: He thinks the knight-commander's mad. He told me she's gone behind your back to investigate guardsmen she suspects as secret mages. 6154057
*  Aveline: Even if that were true, he wouldn't tell you. 6154060
  Anders: He won't fight for her when the time comes. Would you turn against your own husband? 6154063
 Aveline: I don't know if you're lying or crazy. 6154066
───────
(During The Last Straw)
 Aveline: Just to be clear Anders: when this is over, you will turn yourself in for your crime.
 Anders: I'm well aware of your commitment to oppression. 6200737
 Aveline: The laws of the land. Fairly applied to everyone. 6200740
 Anders: That...is actually something I'd very much like to see.

Anders and Bethany
  Bethany: So, you were in the Circle and ran away. I don't know if I'd be brave enough to do that. 6136444
*  Anders: You've been an apostate your whole life. 6151224
  Bethany: Exactly. It was never anything I had to work for. 6151227
  Bethany: Other people always took the risks, to keep me free.
───────
  Anders: Where did you learn your magic? 6136334
  Anders: I mean, you know my feelings on the Circle, but usually it's the only decent training a mage can get. 6154098
  Bethany: My father taught me. He was in the Circle once, trained there. But he got away. 6154101
  Anders: You don't know how lucky you were, to have someone who loved you and could help you. Most mages would kill for that. 6154104
  Bethany: You remind me of him. 6154107
───────
  Anders: The Rite of Tranquility is the whole problem. If they didn't have that to hold over us, we'd have so many more options. 6136335
  Bethany: Right! If we want to fight back... or just engage in intelligent debate... they make sure we can't do it. 6154110
  Anders: They're forcing our hands. There's no way to change things peacefully. 6154113
  Bethany: There must be something. 6154116
*  Anders: If it's Tranquility or death, we have no choice but to make every confrontation a life-or-death struggle. 6154119
*  Bethany: I know, but... there are good people in the Circle, the Chantry.
  Bethany: There has to be a way to reason with them. 6157376
  Anders: Not if they take away your ability to reason. 6154128
───────
  Bethany: I know it didn't work the way you wanted, but... it was brave, what you did with Justice. 6136445
  Anders: It was meant well. I don't know if that's enough to forgive me. 6151233
  Bethany: It must have been hard for him, being trapped outside the Fade. In a place where no one's like him. 6151236
  Bethany: I bet he appreciated having a friend. 6151239
  Anders: He did. 6151242

Anders and Carver
Anders: You don't like me, Carver? 6147628
Carver: I don't like you. 6147631
Anders: That's unfortunate. Hating someone just because they're a mage is a shameful thing. 6147735
Carver: I don't hate you because you're a mage. I hate you because you won't shut up about it. 6147972
Carver: Oppression this, templars that. I'd heard enough long before you. 6147975
Anders: Maybe it's time you put some thought into it. 6148024
───────
Carver: What are you looking at? 6148450
Anders:
(If Hawke is male) Your brother is a mage. As was your sister and father?
(If Hawke is female) Your sisters are... were both mages, as was your father?
Carver: And I'm not. What of it? 6147413
Anders: Nothing, it's not always passed to all siblings. But it's good to know that you understand our plight.
Carver: Shove your plight. 6147605
───────
Anders: I'm sorry about your sister. She sounds like a special girl. 6136339
Carver: Why? Because she was a mage? 6154189
Anders:
(If Hawke is male) Your brother says she had a good heart. Being on the run never made her bitter.
(If Hawke is female) Your other sister says she was a good person. That she never turned down a chance to help people.
Carver: Yes, yes. I'm sure the Chantry's got a shrine with her portrait on it. 6154198
Anders: I was trying to be nice. 6154201
Carver: Stick to surly. It works for you. 6154204
───────
Anders: Nice day to be planning a trip into the Deep Roads, don't you think? 6136340
Anders: The Blight, the dampness, the festering darkness filled with tainted rats... 6154207
Carver: Shut up. 6015933
Anders: You've got a real chip on your shoulder, you know? 6154213
Carver: I've got a big blade on my shoulder, magey. 6154216
Anders: Right. Wonder what you're compensating for. 6154219

Anders and Fenris
Act 1
Anders: You ever going to stop harping on the mages here? 6163405
Fenris: No. 6015185
Anders: They aren't what you saw in Tevinter. 6163411
Fenris: The moment they are free, mages will make themselves magisters. 6163414
Anders: They're slaves! You should want to help them.
Fenris: I don't. 6163420
───────
Anders: So, there must be mages in Tevinter that don't use blood magic.
Fenris: Of course. There are slaves. The magisters do not hesitate to collar their own kind. 6163424
Anders: But no magisters? 6163427
Fenris: Why must you go on about this? No magister would turn down an advantage over his rivals. If he did, he'd be dead. 6163430
Anders: You know, to use blood magic you must look a demon in the eye and accept his offer.
Anders: I just figured some of them would say no. For aesthetic reasons, if nothing else.
───────
(After completing Tranquility)
Fenris: Did I hear correctly? You are an... abomination? 6141441
Anders: Why don't you shout? I don't think everyone heard you. 6141444
Fenris: Do you see yourself as harmless, then? An abomination who would never harm someone?
Anders: Like ripping someone's heart out of his chest? 6141450
Fenris: I did that at the behest of no demon. 6141453
Anders: So we agree that it doesn't take a demon for someone to be a vicious killer? Good. 6141456
───────
Fenris: Why was your friend made Tranquil? Do you know? 6141491
Anders: No, and it doesn't matter. Nobody deserves that. 6141494
Fenris: I know some mages that deserve that.
Anders: Really? Perhaps they should start making slaves Tranquil—then they wouldn't dream of escaping! Wouldn't that be wonderful? 6141500
Fenris: Slaves do not attract demons that try to possess them. 6141503
Anders: Which clearly justifies it? What a perfect solution! 6141506
───────
Act 2
Fenris: Is there something you want, Anders? 6163437
Anders: You really don't have the temperament for a slave. 6163440
Fenris: Is that a compliment or an insult? 6163443
Anders: I'm just wondering how your master didn't kill you. 6163446
Fenris: How have the templars not killed you? 6163449
Anders: I'm charming. 6163452
───────
Anders: Did you ever think about killing yourself? 6163453
Fenris: I could ask you the same thing. 6163456
Anders: I'm serious. To get out of slavery, to escape Danarius... don't tell me you never thought about it. 6163459
Fenris: I did not. To kill oneself is a sin in the eyes of the Maker. 6163462
Anders: You... believe that? 6173756
Fenris: I try to. Some things must be worse than slavery. 6163465
Anders: Some things are worse than death. 6163468
───────
Fenris: You should have lived in Tevinter. You'd be happier there. 6141511
Anders: You're probably right. 6141514
Fenris: There, your magic would be a mark of honor. Apprenticed to the right Magister, you would do well.
Anders: Is there a down side? 6141520
Fenris: Only if you're bothered by owning a few slaves and performing the occasional blood ritual. 6141523
Anders: So they all do those things? 6141526
Fenris: Just the ones who don't complain about how powerless and persecuted they are. 6141529
───────
(If you complete Dissent)
Fenris: I seem to recall you saying something a while ago... 6141549
Anders: Shut up. 6015933
Fenris: "I can control it." Wasn't that what you said?
Anders: So help me... 6141558
───────
(If Hawke spent the night with Fenris)

Anders: I can't imagine what Hawke sees in you. 6163506
Fenris: It is done. Leave it be. 6163509
Anders: Well, good. I always knew she/he had some sense.
Fenris: Do not make light of this. Leaving was the hardest thing I've ever done. 6163518
(If Isabela is in the party)

Isabela: Oh, will you two get over yourselves? You're like two dogs around a bitch in heat.
Fenris: We were talking about Hawke. Not you. 6163535
(If Isabela is in the party and you slept with her as well)

Isabela: Oh, will you two get over yourselves? I did her/him too.
───────
Act 3
Anders: Do you still support the Knight-Commander?
Fenris: I don't care a fig for her. But she's the only one holding back the madness in this city. 6163472
Anders: Holding back? She's howling at the bloody moon! 6163475
Anders: Even her own people think she's lost it. 6163478
Anders: What will it take for you to see that she's crazy? 6163481
Fenris: Mages in glass houses shouldn't throw fireballs. 6163484
───────
Anders: By now, you must see what an injustice the templars are. 6141563
Fenris: Must I? I see templars trying to control what they have good reason to fear. 6141566
Anders: But they go too far. 6141569
Fenris: Talk to Hawke about his/her mother. Ask him/her who went "too far."
Anders: You can't hold all mages responsible for that! 6141578
Fenris: It doesn't take all mages to cause this. Only the weak ones. 6141581
───────
Anders: Not all mages are weak. 6141586
(If Hawke is a mage)

Fenris: True. Hawke, for instance, is not weak. 6141589
(Otherwise)

Fenris: Bethany, for instance, was not weak.
Anders: You specifically don't mention me. 6141595
Fenris: That's also true. 6141598
Anders: I'll prove to you that I'm not weak
Fenris: Prove it to yourself. You're convincing no one else. 6141604
───────
(If Hawke spent the night with Fenris, but moved on to Anders)

Anders: You were an idiot to leave Hawke. 6163488
Fenris: And you were fast enough to replace me. 6163491
Anders: I love him/her. You can't even imagine what that is.
Fenris: Do not bare your heart to me, mage, unless you would have me rip it out.
───────
(If Hawke spent the night with Fenris, but moved on to Anders)

Fenris: You... are living with Hawke now?
Anders: What's it to you? 6141616
Fenris: Be good to him/her. Break his/her heart, and I will kill you.

Anders and Isabela
Act 1
Isabela: Hello? Is Anders there? Can I speak to Anders? 6155418
Anders: You can stop yelling. It's always me. 6155421
Isabela: Oh, good. I didn't want to talk to that other guy. You know, the stick-in-the-mud. 6155424
Anders: He can still hear you. Justice and I are one. 6155427
Anders: Anyway, you wanted to talk to me? 6155430
Isabela: Not really. I just wanted to make sure it was you. 6155433
───────
Anders: I keep thinking I know you from somewhere... 6136353
Isabela: You're Fereldan, right? Ever spend time at the Pearl? 6163543
Anders: That's it! 6051798
Anders: You used to really like that girl with the griffon tattoos, right? What was her name? 6163549
Isabela: The Lay Warden? 6163552
Anders: That's right! I think you were there the night I— 6163555
Isabela: Oh! Were you the runaway mage who could do that electricity thing? That was nice... 6163558
Hawke: Please stop talking. Now. 6163562
(Or if Varric is in the party)

Varric: I don't think I need to know this about either of you. 6163561
───────
Anders: Isabela, you never talk about the mages' plight. 6171526
Isabela: What's there to say? 6171529
Anders: There's plenty to say. 6171532
Isabela: And you say enough for the lot of us, don't you think? 6171535
Anders: So you're telling me you have no opinion on the matter? 6171538
Isabela: None whatsoever! 6171541
Anders: That can't be true. 6171544
Isabela: No, I'm afraid I'm really this shallow. 6171547
───────
Anders: Sometimes, I think you have the right idea. 6136354
Isabela: Handcuffs, whipped cream, always be on top? 6163565
Anders: I never used to give two bits what anyone thought of me. 6163568
Anders: Justice once asked me why I didn't do more for other mages. I told him it was too much work. 6163571
Anders: But I couldn't go back after that. Couldn't stop thinking about it. 6163574
Anders: Sometimes, I miss being that selfish. 6163577
Isabela: Huh? Were you talking? I was still at "whipped cream."
───────
Act 2
Anders: What makes this relic of yours so valuable? 6136356
Isabela: The same thing that makes anything valuable. Someone's willing to pay for it. 6163610
Anders: That's not evasive. 6163634
Isabela: Look, I didn't get where I am by showing my hand, you know?
Anders: No, your hand isn't what I hear you've been showing. 6163640
───────
Anders: Do you ever have any regrets?
Isabela: About what? 6154054
Anders: Anything? Everything? I can't figure you out. 6163586
Isabela: The past's past. I learned that young. If it can't bring you gold or giggles, what's the point in dwelling on it? 6163615
Anders: Maybe the chance to fix a mistake? Make things right again? 6163618
Isabela: Eh. Our mistakes make us who we are. 6163621
Anders: That was almost profound. 6164297
───────
Anders: So, this relic you lost... how is it you don't know what it is?
Isabela: It was in a box. 6155475
Anders: And you didn't open it? You managed to resist the urge? 6155478
Isabela: It was locked. It was a locked box! 6155481
Anders: Hasn't stopped you before. 6155484
Isabela: What do you want me to say? 6155487
Anders: Nothing. I just found it curious, that's all. 6155490
───────
Anders: You do have an opinion on mages, don't you? 6155496
Isabela: Of course I do. I just don't feel a constant need to bring it up. 6155499
Isabela: (Sighs) Mages don't worry me. And I don't believe the templars when they say I should be worried.
Isabela: I'm more likely to be shanked in a bar than eaten by an abomination. You can hear those coming a mile away. 6155508
Isabela: "Grr. Argh!" "Oh, is that an abomination coming to eat us? We should get out of here!"
Anders: Abominations don't go, "Grr. Argh."
Isabela: They don't? I should rethink the whole thing, then. 6155517
───────
Act 3
Anders: You're not nearly as selfish as you pretend. 6136357
Isabela: Hey! You take that back! 6163643
Anders: You had your relic. You were gone. There was no reason for you to come back and face the Qunari. 6163646
Isabela: I still don't have a ship. I thought I could get one. 6163649
Anders: From a bunch of shipwrecked Qunari? 6163652
Isabela: From the Viscount. I just got here late.
Anders: I always knew you had a heart of gold. 6163658
Isabela: Shh! Don't tell anyone. 6163664
───────
Anders: I don't know how you live the way you do, blithely ignoring the consequences of your actions. 6155523
Isabela: This is about the Qunari thing, isn't it? I'm not ignoring it. I just recognize that it happened years ago. 6155526
Isabela: There's this fantastic thing called "moving on." You should try it sometime.
Anders: Has it occurred to you that Kirkwall is only just recovering from the Qunari attack? 6155532
Isabela: And you want me to... what? Flog myself daily? 6155535
Isabela: Has it occurred to you that maybe there's no justice in the world? Other than that voice you keep in your head. 6155538
───────
Anders: There is justice in the world. 6155544
Isabela: Is there? You want to free the mages. Let's say you do, but to get there, you kill a bunch of innocent people. 6155547
Isabela: What about them? Don't they then deserve justice? 6155550
Anders: Yes. 6018811
Isabela: And then what? Where does it end? 6155556
Isabela: It's like a bar brawl. People are continuously pulled into the fray, and nobody remembers why it started. 6155559
Isabela: Justice is an idea. It makes sense in a world of ideas, but not in our world. 6155562
───────
Anders: I can't believe you're still not taking sides. 6136358
Isabela: I told you, I only like to be on top. 6163720
Anders: I mean against the templars! You like freedom, right? You hate slavery. 6163723
Anders: Why wouldn't you side with the mages? 6163726
Isabela: Maybe I just don't like you. 6163729

Anders and Merrill
Act 1
Anders: So, when you first did blood magic, it was... just an accident, right? 6136362
Anders: You cut yourself and realized the power? You didn't actually deal with a demon? 6163732
Merrill: Oh, no. I did.
Anders: Why would you do that? 6163738
Merrill: I needed his help. He was really very nice about it. 6163741
Anders: Of course he was! He's using you to get a foothold in a mortal brain! 6163744
Merrill: He's a spirit. He offered me his aid. I hardly think you're one to criticize. 6163747
───────
Merrill: I heard Varric saying you were a Grey Warden. 6136638
Anders: I was. 6165354
Merrill: I met a warden once. Back in Ferelden. Duncan, I think his name was. Very odd man.
Merrill: He had a marvelous beard, though. I'd never seen one before. I thought a squirrel had grabbed him by the chin. 6165424
───────
(If the Hero of Ferelden was Dalish and survived the battle with the Archdemon)

Merrill: I heard Varric saying you were a Grey Warden. 6136638
Anders: I was. 6165354
Merrill: Did you... did you ever meet a Dalish Warden? Mahariel? 6165361
Anders: As a matter of fact, I did. 6165365
Anders: Do you know her/him?
Merrill: We grew up together. S/He was one of my clan.
Merrill: I keep hoping to hear some news... 6165415
Anders: I wouldn't get your hopes up. The Hero of Ferelden values privacy rather highly. 6165421
───────
(If the Hero of Ferelden was Dalish, but died killing the Archdemon)

Merrill: I heard Varric saying you were a Grey Warden. 6136638
Anders: I was. 6165354
Merrill: Did you... did you ever meet a Dalish Warden? Mahariel? 6165361
Anders: No. I had a friend who did, though. Told the most impossible stories. 6165367
Merrill: I'd like to hear them, sometime. If you don't mind. 6165376

In all likelihood, the friend Anders is referring to is Oghren
───────
Merrill: Ser Pounce-a-lot... who knighted him? 6136639
Anders: Is that a serious question? 6165432
Merrill: Did he have a little sword, or just his claws? I bet he had a dashing cap with a feather in it! 6165435
Anders: Would you stop making fun of my cat? 6165451
Merrill: Oh... no hat, then? 6165454
───────
Anders: Maybe you don't really understand the difference between spirits and demons. 6136363
Merrill: Did I ask you? 6163750
Anders: Spirits were the first children of the Maker, but He turned his back on them to dote on His mortal creations.
Anders: The ones who resented this became demons, driven to take everything mortals had and gain back the Maker's favor. 6163756
Merrill: Your "Maker" is a story you humans use to explain the world.
Merrill: We have our own stories. I don't need to borrow yours. 6163762
───────
Act 2
Merrill: You could get another cat, you know. There's one in the Lowtown market with a litter of kittens ready to wean. 6136640
Anders: You don't pay attention to templars, Qunari or politics, but you notice kittens?
Merrill: Templars, Qunari, and politics don't meow and attack your feet when you're buying food. 6165605
Anders: Are there any tabbies? I'd like a tabby. 6165608
───────
Anders: Do Dalish honestly not recognize the difference between demons and beneficial spirits? 6136364
Merrill: We've never thought of the Fade as the home of our gods. 6163765
Merrill: It is another realm, another people's home. No different or more foreign than, say, Orzammar. 6163768
(If Varric is in the party)

Varric: You can say that again. 6163771
Anders: But have you never studied the types of demons? They break down very clearly into different sins— 6163774
Merrill: Spirits differ from each other, just as you and Hawke and Isabela are all human. 6163777
Merrill: More or less... 6163780
───────
(If you complete Dissent and stop Anders from killing Ella)

Merrill: Are you all right? 6028361
Anders: I nearly killed an innocent girl. How could I be all right? 6166394
Merrill: I'm sorry. 6030492
Anders: You're sorry? For me? This could be you! You could be the next monster threatening helpless girls! 6166406
Merrill: Anders... There's no such thing as a good spirit. There never was. 6166409
Merrill: All spirits are dangerous. I understood that. I'm sorry that you didn't. 6166412
───────
(If you complete Dissent on a rivalry path with Anders)

Anders: It's not a good feeling, you know. 6136365
Merrill: What? 6015974
Anders: Being an abomination. I just got a taste of your future. 6163861
Merrill: I'm not that foolish. Our relationship is, um, strictly platonic. 6163864
Anders: It's like you're trapped in your own body, seeing out your eyes, while someone else moves you like a puppet. 6163867
Anders: And you're trying to scream, to move a single muscle, but there's no escape. Until you look down at the blood on your hands... 6163870
Merrill: Stop it. You're scaring me. 6163873
Anders: That's the point. 6163876
───────
Act 3
Anders: You must join us. Do you see that now? You must stand with Kirkwall's mages. 6136367
Merrill: It's not my fight. 6163894
Anders: You can't hide in Sundermount. 6163897
(If the Dalish were killed during A New Path)

Anders: Your clan is dead. 6163900
(Otherwise)

Anders: There is no place for you among the Dalish. 6163903
Merrill: No! My clan is all I ever cared about! Everything I did, I did for them! 6163906
Anders: On second thought, maybe don't try to help us. 6163909
───────
Merrill: Have I ever mentioned I like your coat?
Anders: You do? 6166452
Merrill: It's very lively! Like a crow in the middle of anting! 6166455
Anders: That's.... that's great. Thanks, Merrill.
(If Varric is in the party)

Varric: I tried to warn you, Blondie. 6166461
Anders: You're not helping. 6117472
(If Isabela is in the party)

Isabela: I wouldn't have called them "lively." Bedraggled, maybe. Or just... fluffy.
Anders: You're not helping. 6117472
───────
Merrill: You really believe don't you?
Anders: What are we talking about? 6166671
Merrill: Believing. You do I can tell, in freedom, in mages, in good spirits and bad templars. With more fire than the sun.
Anders: And your point is? 6166677
Merrill: I miss it sometimes, things being certain.
Anders: Some things are certain. 6166720
Merrill: Not anymore. 6134905
───────
(During A New Path)

Anders: I don't know why I'm bothering with this, but you do realize it is crazy, right?
Merrill: Believe me I noticed, if I had any other choices, I'd take them.
Anders: You have choices! You always had choices! Stop using blood magic. Get rid of that damned mirror.
Merrill: Oh in that case, I will head back to Kirkwall and throw it away, right after you abandon the plight of the circle of mages.
───────
(If you complete A New Path)

Anders: Your Keeper did not deserve that death. 6136366
Merrill: It was my risk to take! I never asked her to do this for me. 6163879
Anders: She knew you didn't have the strength to resist the demon. That's why it picked you. 6163882
Merrill: Why are you doing this? What can I do about it now? 6163885
Anders: Make up for your mistakes. Most blood mages never get a second chance. 6163888
───────
(If Hawke romanced Merrill but also slept with Isabela)

Anders: Hawke was a fool to let you move in. You'll only betray him/her. That's all your kind can do.
Merrill: Why do you only do this to me? Are you jealous? You don't get upset about Hawke and Isabela.
Anders: You can't really get jealous of someone for sleeping with Isabela. It's just...understood.
Anders: She's like a side dish. She comes with the meal. 6172256
(If Isabela is in the party)

Isabela: Only if it's a good meal. 6172259
───────
(If Hawke romanced Anders)

Merrill: Are you happy? 6165469
Anders: Beg your pardon? 6165472
Merrill: S/He seems happy. Hawke, I mean. Are you?
Anders: Yes, I suppose I am. 6165481
Merrill: Good! You've spent much too much time being grumpy. It's a nice change. 6165485
───────

Anders and Sebastian
Act 2
Anders: Is that supposed to be Andraste's face on your crotch? 6172263
Sebastian: What? 6015974
Anders: That... belt buckle thing. Is that Andraste? 6172269
Sebastian: My father had this armor commissioned when I took my vows as a brother. 6172272
Anders: I'm just not sure I'd want the Maker seeing me shove His bride's head between my legs every morning. 6172275
───────
Anders: So, you were invested as a brother in the chantry, right?
Sebastian: I had just taken my vows when I learned my family was killed. 6172279
Anders: But you... gave sermons and took confessions and such, right? 6172282
Sebastian: Do you have something you wish to confess? 6172285
Anders: I just want to know, what do you say when people have questions? 6172288
Anders: What's your answer when someone asks, "so if Andraste preached freedom and ended slavery, why do you lock up mages and keep them as slaves?"
Sebastian: No one ever asked that. 6172294
───────
Sebastian: You seem very angry. 6172691
Anders: And here I thought the Chantry was against mind-reading. 6172694
Sebastian: Did something happen to you in the Circle? I understand there were problems in Ferelden... 6172697
Anders: Are you saying a mage can only be unhappy in the Circle if demons were involved?
Anders: No, it's not about Uldred. It's not about being beaten or raped by a templar— that does happen, but I've been fortunate. 6172703
Anders: It' s a larger principle: the freedom every man, woman, and child born in Thedas have as a natural right.
Sebastian: You were given to the Circle. I was given to the Chantry. Hawke was driven away from home by the Darkspawn.
Sebastian: None of us are free. 6172712
───────
(If you complete Dissent)

Sebastian: So your "Tranquil Solution" was hardly the holocaust you imagined.
Anders: You've been seeking revenge for the death of one family for as long as I've known you. 6172716
Anders: Are you honestly judging me for trying to save the lives of every mage in Thedas? 6172719
Sebastian: But they were never threatened. It was a single man's lunacy. 6172722
Sebastian: The Chantry would never follow through with such a thing. 6172725
Anders: Yet. 6131164
───────
Act 3
Anders: How can you keep standing up for her? 6172729
Sebastian: Who? 6049744
Anders: That doddering old biddy of a Grand Cleric.
Sebastian: How dare you! Elthina is everything a grand cleric should be. She's holy, wise— 6172738
Anders: Spineless... hesitant. She's clay in Meredith's hands. 6172741
Sebastian: In the face of danger, sometimes the bravest thing is to stand back and trust that the Maker will see justice done. 6172744
Anders: Well if doing nothing sums up your religion, then Elthina is perfect. Personally, I'd prefer a Chantry that favors action over sloth. 6172747
───────
Sebastian: You've made no secret of your intent to lead the mages here in revolution. 6172748
Anders: Well, I've tried not to shout it from the rooftops. You've just been around when I talk with my friends. 6172751
Sebastian: Well, as we have mutual friends—who for some reason don't want you to get hurt—let me tell you this: 6172754
Sebastian: If you go forward with this revolt, the Chantry will bring its full might to bear. They will kill you. 6172757
Anders: Andraste was killed. That doesn't mean she failed. 6172760
Sebastian: Do not compare yourself to Andraste. 6172763
───────
Anders: Go ahead. Say it. 6172295
Sebastian: Say what? 6172298
Anders: I saw you watching me. 6172301
Sebastian: I was looking at the clouds. 6172304
Anders: Don't give me that. I know you've been judging me. 6172307
Anders: You think I'm out of control. How can I claim to speak for mages when I'm half demon myself? 6172310
Sebastian: The one over there looks a bit like a bunny rabbit. 6172313
(If Merrill is in the party)

Merrill: I saw that too! 6172316
───────
Anders: How can you have so much faith? Does nothing bother you? 6172317
Sebastian: You're bothering me. 6172320
Anders: The Maker left us to our own devices generations ago. 6172323
Anders: He's never going to step back in, start listening to our prayers again. He's gone. 6172326
Anders: Doesn't that bother you? 6155628
Sebastian: He's a merciful lord. He could have destroyed our world when we failed Him, but instead He gave us a chance at redemption. 6172332
Sebastian: Should we not be joyful? 6172335

Anders and Varric
Act 1
Anders: What? 6015974
Varric: Just wondering if the feathered pauldrons are an essential part of the moody rebel mage persona. 6163969
Anders: What are you talking about? 6000960
Varric: I'm working on an epic poem about a hopelessly romantic apostate waging an epic struggle against forces he can't possibly defeat. 6163975
Anders: What do you mean, "can't possibly defeat?"
Varric: Well, it's not a good story unless the hero dies. 6163981
───────
Anders: I've always wondered, why is every surface dwarf a merchant or a smith? 6136692
Varric: You left out criminals and hired muscle. 6167212
Anders: They don't count. 6167215
Varric: We dwarves are drawn to shiny objects. Sort of like Magpies, but with business sense.
Anders: You're kidding. 6167220
Varric: Of course I am. We come to the surface with the skills our ancestors had, Blondie. 6167223
Varric: You think there's a tradition of dwarf woodcutters in Orzammar? Bee keepers? Sailors?
Anders: Well, there could be mushroom growers and nug wranglers. 6167229
Varric: Orzammar will never let those people go topside. Too vital. Also, embarrassing. 6167232
───────
Varric: So a human, an elf, and a dwarf walk into a bar... 6136693
Anders: The human says, "You're lucky you're so short. That hurt like mad!"
Varric: You could have just stopped me, Blondie.
Anders: Why waste a perfectly good set-up? 6169882
───────
Act 2
Anders: Boiling in oil. 6136373
Varric: Too prosaic. Trapped in a cave with hungry bears, right at the spring thaw. 6163999
Anders: That lets him off too easy. Dipped in molten gold and left as a statue in the Viscount's Keep. 6164002
Varric: Ooh. That's poetic! 6164005
Hawke: What are you two talking about? 6164008
Varric: What to do to Bartrand when I find him. 6164011
Anders: Any suggestions? 6164014
───────
Varric: Blondie, I don't mean to sound critical, but have you considered a new line of work? 6136694
Anders: Such as? 6169987
Varric: Pretty much anything? I don't think "renegade mage" has a bright future. Or any retirement plan.
───────
Varric: If you've got something to say, just spit it out. 6136695
Anders: Are you sure you want to encourage me? I might be about to confess my undying love. 6170313
Varric: I get that a lot. So what's on your mind? 6170316
Anders: I just realized it's been a while since any of the gangs in the Undercity came to my door. 6170319
Varric: They're busy people. Places to go, throats to cut. Maybe you've slipped their minds. 6170322
Anders: Right. The apostate running the free clinic in the sewers. Easy to forget. You didn't have anything to do with this? 6170325
Varric: You must have me confused with someone else! I'm just a businessman and a storyteller. 6170328
───────
(If you complete Dissent)

Varric: Oh, cheer up, Blondie. You're making me cry just looking at you. 6136374
Anders: Don't. 6164017
Varric: You made a mistake. It happens. 6164020
Anders: I almost killed a girl. 6164026
Varric: You've killed two-hundred and fifty-four by my last count. Plus about five hundred men, a few dozen giant spiders, and at least two demons. 6164029
Anders: It's not the same. 6164032
Varric: Why? Because this one you feel bad about? Maybe that's the problem. 6164035
───────
Act 3
Varric: So, three templars walk into a tavern. 6136696
Anders: Not right now, Varric. 6170379
Varric: You feeling all right, Blondie? You're always in the mood for templar jokes. 6170382
───────
Varric: So, the knight-commander... Boiling in oil? That one never gets old. 6136376
Anders: This is past time for joking. 6164056
Varric: I'm helping you indulge in elaborate revenge fantasies. I think it's good for you. 6164059
Anders: Meredith will die. Do not doubt that. 6164062
Varric: Go away, Justice. Can Anders come out and play? 6164065
Anders: [Justice voice] Stop.
Varric: You are no fun anymore. 6164071
───────
Varric: You've been glowering for days. Your face is going to get stuck that way. 6136697
Anders: My face is the least of my concerns right now. 6170385
Varric: That's because you don't have to look at it. 6170388
Varric: If you could see it from this angle, Blondie, it'd be at least a close second on your priority list. 6170391
───────
(If Hawke romances Anders)

Anders: You're giving me that look again. What are you writing this time? 6136375
Varric: So, you and Hawke... I need some details. Did you go down on one knee? Did he/she jump you? Did you swear eternal vows of love, or is this just a physical thing?
Anders: I don't see how that's any of your business. 6164050
Varric: Fine, but if you don't tell me, I'm just going to have to make it up.

Aveline and Bethany
Bethany: Was Wesley based out of the Lothering chantry? I don't remember seeing him there.
Aveline: He served elsewhere. He was coming to find me at Ostagar. 6151245
Aveline: Were you familiar with every templar in Lothering? 6151248
Bethany: How else was I supposed to know when to run and hide? 6151251
───────
Bethany: Being a guardsman seems like a better life than being a soldier. 6136450
Aveline: Oh? 6149609
Bethany: My brother was a soldier. It's all about taking land and serving some king you've never met. 6151257
Bethany: Guardsmen, they do something real. They protect people. They make their lives better. 6151260
Aveline: I don't know if I agree. 6151263
Bethany: Neither would my brother. 6151266
───────
Bethany: How come you and Wesley never had children? I mean, sorry if that's too personal— 6136451
Aveline: It's all right. 6150385
Aveline: I was a soldier and he was a templar. We knew that our personal lives would have to wait. 6151272
Aveline: Distance never mattered, but we ran out of time. It is what it is. 6151275
Bethany: Now that he's gone, do you ever wish— 6151278
Aveline: That's too personal. 6151281
───────
Aveline: You show admirable restraint, Bethany. 6160752
Bethany: For a mage, you mean. 6160755
Aveline: I could also say, "for a Hawke," but yes, for a mage.
Bethany: You have a sword. Why aren't you killing someone right now? 6160761
Aveline: Fair point, but I can put my sword down. 6160764
Bethany: Believe me, I have tried. 6160767
───────
Aveline: I'm sorry I couldn't get you more information about the Circle, Bethany. It's difficult without naming you. 6160771
Bethany: Thank you for being discreet. I don't want the templars at my door. 6160774
Aveline: No one does. 6160777
Bethany: Let them corral the troublemakers. I just want information. 6160780
Aveline: Right. Right. 6160783
Bethany: It sounds like I'm trying to convince myself, doesn't it? 6160786
Aveline: I wouldn't have said. But yes. 6160789

Aveline and Carver
Carver: Did you approve my application? 6148033
Aveline: I can't make you a guard, Carver. 6148455
Carver: We were both soldiers. Why won't they take me? 6148458
Aveline: I was an officer. And I follow orders. 6148461
Carver: (Laughs) No you don't.
Aveline: I also think of others before myself. You seem tired of that, and that's dangerous. 6148467
Carver: Just when it's not my choice. You told them not to take me, didn't you? 6148470
Aveline: Yes. 6018811
───────
Carver: I'm surprised you still travel with us, Aveline. 6148036
Aveline: Carver, don't. 6148476
Carver: You're ever so busy with the guardsmen. It must be a burden to slum with the refugees. 6148479
Aveline: It's oddly comforting that you insult me like I'm family. 6148482
Carver: That wasn't... no, I didn't mean that. 6149166
Aveline: I know. But you should be glad that's how I took it. 6149169
───────
Aveline: I don't like some of the people you've been associating with, Carver. 6160829
Carver: Talk to my brother/sister. He/She's the one in charge.
(If on friendship path with Aveline)

Aveline: Maybe, but I know you get around. 6160838
(If on rivalry path with Aveline)

Aveline: Who says I don't mean him/her too?
Aveline: This city's full of people who are dead set on ending badly. I don't want to see you end up the same way. 6160847
Carver: Would asking you to stop spying on me help in the least? 6160850
Aveline: No. 6015185
───────
Aveline: So, Carver, have you thought about what you'll do if your expedition doesn't pay off? 6160857
Carver: This is our only chance and you know it. 6160860
Aveline: You're so damned proud you couldn't pick up a trade? 6160863
Carver: And who would take on a Fereldan apprentice? Maybe in another year I could work my way up to pissboy.
Aveline: Fine, let's crawl down some holes. Good bloody luck for your sake. 6160869
───────
Aveline: Tell me, how did your family escape Lothering? Almost everyone who hadn't fled... 6026234
Carver:
(If Hawke is male) My brother. If he wasn't with us, I don't think we'd be here.
(If Hawke is female) My older sister. If she wasn't with us, I don't think we'd be here.
Aveline: But you seem quite skilled as well. 6026243
Carver: I'm not my brother/sister.
Aveline and Fenris
Act 1
Aveline: Are you safe, Fenris? 6160943
Fenris: No. 6015185
Aveline: You know, some guards give people the opportunity to lie if it will keep the peace. 6160949
Fenris: You can see what I am. Lie to yourself if you must. 6160952
───────
Fenris: I understand you're named after a famous knight? 6141645
Aveline: Everyone always brings up the name. 6141648
Fenris: I've not heard of Ser Aveline—is she very famous? 6141651
Aveline: Really? They don't tell of her glorious downfall in Tevinter? 6141654
Fenris: Not to slaves. 6141657
Aveline: Pardon me for saying so, but thank the Maker for that. 6141660
───────
Fenris: You do not like your name? 6141665
Aveline: My name is a wish my father made. And I did want to be a knight, but... 6141668
Fenris: I see. Still, it's a good name. A strong name. 6141671
Aveline: What were you named after? 6141674
Fenris: I don't know my real name. My master called me Fenris, his "little wolf."
Aveline: Could you not call yourself something different now? 6141680
Fenris: Couldn't you? 6141683
Aveline: A fine point. 6141686
───────
(Only if you complete The Way It Should Be)

Aveline: You are known, Fenris. 6160956
Fenris: What? 6015974
Aveline: I'm going through Jeven's neglected reports. Some involve you. And requests about you. 6160962
Fenris: By whom? 6160965
Aveline: I don't know. They're old, poorly kept. But you should be on your best behavior. 6160968
Fenris: Thank you for getting rid of them. 6160971
Aveline: I didn't. 6160974
───────
Act 2
Aveline: All right, I'm just going to say it. Fenris, you need to present yourself better. 6160978
Fenris: What are you talking about? 6000960
Aveline: You're squatting in Hightown. I sympathize with your claims, but your neighbors have influence. 6160984
Fenris: My claims? 6160987
Aveline: To the estate. "Rightfully stolen" isn't exactly something I can forward to the Viscount. Be more discreet about... yourself.
Fenris: I shall endeavor to exist with less offense. 6160993
───────
Aveline: Fenris, did you consider my offer for you to train the guard in Tevinter fighting techniques? I've heard nothing. 6160997
Fenris: My abilities were inflicted, not taught. I will not pass that on. 6161000
Aveline: Some good should come of them. 6161003
Fenris: No. 6015185
───────
Fenris: It feels good to be captain of the guard, yes? 6141691
Aveline: No, I will not change the patrols around your mansion again. There's already been too many questions. 6141694
Fenris: You wound my pride with such accusations. 6141697
Aveline: But you were going to ask. 6141700
Fenris: Eventually. 6141703
Aveline: (Laughs) I'll look at the roster and see what I can do.
───────
(During A Bitter Pill, in the Abandoned Slaver Den, when the Blood Sacrifice is examined)

Fenris: See for yourself. The legacy of the magisters. 6109390
Aveline: Is this... allowed in Tevinter? 6109406
Fenris: In a society where mages rule, they find many ways to justify their need for power. 6109415
───────
Act 3
Fenris: I was speaking with Donnic the other day...
Aveline: Since when do you talk with my husband? 6141714
Fenris: He... comes to the mansion once a week? We play diamondback. 6141717
Aveline: What? Why am I not invited to these games? 6141720
Fenris: He says you get angry when you lose. 6141723
Aveline: I do not! All right, perhaps I do. Still, that's no reason not to tell me. 6141726
(If Isabela is in the party)

Isabela: Perhaps he longed for less masculine companionship? 6141729
Aveline: Shut up, whore. 6141732
(If Varric is in the party)

Varric: It is if he's a betting man. 6141735
Fenris: I disavow any knowledge of gambling occurring in my house.
(Otherwise:)

Fenris: He's a good man, Aveline. I enjoy his visits. 6141741
Aveline: Fine, fine. Have your "man time," then.
───────
Aveline: Do you feel like a citizen, Fenris? 6161010
Fenris: Excuse me? 6120857
Aveline: You've been in Kirkwall as long as I have. Does it feel like home? 6161016
Fenris: I have no comparison, really. It feels like a free place. 6161024
Aveline: Maybe that's enough.
Fenris: We shall see. 6051312
(Alternately, if Fenris is in a relationship with Hawke)

Aveline: You've been in Kirkwall as long as I have. Does it feel like home? 6161016
Fenris: It feels. That itself has been a surprise. 6161019
Aveline: (If The Long Road was completed)I think I know what you mean.
(or)

Aveline: (If The Long Road was not completed)I think I had a chance for that and missed it.
───────
Aveline: There's a war coming. Does it feel different, fighting by choice? 6161034
Fenris: You were never ordered to kill? 6161037
Aveline: I was a soldier, but I was willing. 6161040
Fenris: I was willing, as well, but not by choice. (Laughs) If that makes any sense.
Aveline: Does anything in this mess? 6161046
───────
Aveline: Thank you for that tip, Fenris. 6141749
Fenris: You caught them, then? 6141752
Aveline: Yes—a whole nest of slave runners working out of the Undercity. 6141755
Fenris: I imagine you imprisoned them? 6141758
Aveline: Sadly, they never made it to prison. 6141761
Fenris: You always know how to make me smile, Aveline. 6141764

Aveline and Isabela
Act 1
Aveline: So, Isabela. You're a captain? 6161052
Isabela: That's right, big girl. What of it? 6161055
Aveline: I don't remember your name on any registries. Every ship that docks has to declare. 6161058
Isabela: I never docked, and you're no port authority. 6161061
Aveline: And you... are no merchant. 6161064
Isabela: Ooh... scrutiny. 6161067
───────
Isabela: Do men find you intimidating? What about Wesley? Did he? 6155571
Aveline: Isabela... 6155574
Isabela: What? Too soon? 6155577
Aveline: Too soon, too personal, too... everything coming from you! 6155580
Isabela: Ooh, sore spot? 6155583
Aveline: If you don't shut up, I'll give you a sore spot. 6155586
───────
Isabela: You have such pretty hair. What a lovely color. 6155592
Aveline: Other children used to laugh at me for having ginger hair. 6155595
Isabela: Really? Aww. I bet you were cute. Did you have pigtails? 6155598
Aveline: Sometimes. 6155601
Isabela: How precious! Little Aveline, running around the village with her flaming orange pigtails streaming behind her... 6155604
Isabela: ... and little boys all scattering and screaming for mercy as she approached. 6155607
Aveline: Shut up, whore. 6141732
───────
(Only if you complete The Way It Should Be)

Isabela: Well. "Captain." Can I call you captain? You can call me captain.
Aveline: I won't be doing that. 6161074
Isabela: Neither will I. Because you're a guard captain. No real authority. Not like on a ship. 6161077
Aveline: Well, you would know about having a large number of men under you. 6161080
Isabela: You've been waiting to use that one. Did you practice? 6161083
Aveline: Shut up. 6015933
───────
(When entering the Blooming Rose for the first time)

Isabela: "The difference between whores and courtesans is... well, they have nicer shoes."
Aveline: I think your shoes are fine. 6196717
Isabela: Look at you being funny! That might even get you a man someday. 6196720
───────
Act 2
Aveline: I had trouble with another one of your women, Isabela. She stole from a... distracted client. You're lucky she wasn't jailed.
Isabela: My women? I am but a shepherd. And what free enterprise are you oppressing now? 6161093
Aveline: Theft is not enterprise. 6161096
Isabela: Opportunities insufficiently guarded. Victimless crimes. 6161099
Aveline: Except for all the victims. 6161102
Isabela: Details. Victimless details. 6161105
───────
Aveline: How are you so successful with men? You're not that pretty. 6155616
Isabela: Cast a wide enough net, and you're bound to catch something. 6155619
Aveline: (Laughs) At least you're willing to admit it.
Isabela: Trust me. I've heard, "Get away from me, you pirate hag!" more times than I care to count.
Aveline: Doesn't that bother you? 6155628
Isabela: Why should it? They don't know me. I know me. 6155631
───────
Aveline: You're right. 6065323
Isabela: About? 6155643
Aveline: About knowing who you are. 6155646
Aveline: I'm the captain of the guard. I'm loyal, strong, and I don't look too bad naked. 6155649
Isabela: Exactly. And if I called you a mannish, awkward, ball-crushing do-gooder, you'd say...? 6155652
Aveline: Shut up, whore. 6141732
Isabela: That's my girl. 6155658
───────
 (After completing The Long Road)

Isabela: So, how good is Donnic? Is he cocksure? 6161109
Aveline: (Sighs) Just... get it out of your system.
Isabela: Did he curl your toes? 6161115
(Isabela will say four of the following at random:)

Isabela: Dwarf your beard?
Isabela: Arl your Eamon? 6161133
Isabela: Shank your Jory? 6161142
Isabela: Praise your Maker? 6161151
Isabela: Grope your grinder? 6161124
Isabela: Establish his canon? 6161148
Isabela: Kaddis your Katie? 6161139
Isabela: Dampen your Divine? 6161127
Isabela: Pamper your Paragon? 6161136
Isabela: Grey your Warden?
Isabela: Pudding your peach? 6161118
Isabela: Float your frigate? 6161130
Isabela: Explore your Deep Roads?
(The fifth will always be one of the following)

Isabela: How about "satisfy a demand of your Qun."
Isabela: Or did he Cup your Joining? 6161160
Isabela: Or master your taint? That's an old one. 6161154
Aveline: Yes, all right? He is an incredibly proficient lover. Happy? 6161163
Isabela: Well that's rather personal, don't you think? 6161166
───────
Act 3
Aveline: You didn't come to my solstice dinner party. 6155664
Isabela: Look at you! Dinner parties, cooking... do you have a lace apron yet, or should I get one for you? 6155667
Aveline: Don't change the subject. I sent you an invitation, and you didn't show up. 6155670
Isabela: I thought it would be... I mean, I don't know. I just don't do family gatherings. 6155673
Isabela: Besides, one day you and Donnic will have children, and I'll be the last person you want around them. 6155676
Isabela: Imagine all the awkward questions you'd have to answer. "Mother, what's a Slattern?"
Aveline: I'll just point at you and say, "That's a Slattern."
───────
(If The Long Road was completed)

Isabela: So, Donnic was in the Rose. 6162088
Aveline: He was not! 6162091
Isabela: Easy, big girl. He wasn't shopping for himself. You're lucky to have a man who wants to please you. 6162094
Isabela: But, maybe you could indulge him more. Are there areas of intimacy you haven't explored? 6162097
Aveline: Why? Why do you give me these doubts! 6162100
Isabela: Aveline. If you shove your thumb up his ass, I win. 6162103
(The last line depends on who else is in the party)

Anders: Just... no. 6171268
Fenris: (Laughs)
Merrill: Ew! 6171266
Varric: Ah, that old chestnut. 6171267
Sebastian: Ugh. Maker. 6171269
Hawke: (Coughs)
───────
(If The Long Road was not completed)

Isabela: So, Donnic was in the Rose. 6162088
Aveline: Good. Happy for him. He needs to calm down. 6162104
Isabela: You're tough on the man. I don't see how it's his fault if you missed your chance. 6162107
Aveline: Isabela, I realize that you are always prepared for a sudden random phallus, but for your own safety, shut your mouth! 6162110
───────
(If The Long Road was completed)

Isabela: How's marriage been treating you, big girl? 6155688
Aveline: It's been good. No, great. I'd forgotten what it was like to... 6155691
Isabela: Be flipped ass over tits and hammered like a bent nail? 6155694
Aveline: To. Be. Loved. 6155697
Isabela: Oh. Right, of course. 6155700
Aveline: Not that I'm complaining about the other thing. 6155703
───────
(If The Long Road was not completed)

Isabela: So how long has it been? Six years? Seven? 6171567
Aveline: None of your business. 6085575
Isabela: You ever thought of going to the Rose? They're discreet and remarkably affordable if you forgo all the extras. 6171573
Aveline: Quiet! 6171576
Isabela: Not that sensual massages aren't lovely, but in a dire situation like yours, you need to get straight to the point. 6171579
Isabela: Some good old fashioned, headboard slamming-
Aveline: If you don't shut your mouth, I'm going to slam your head against something. 6171585
Isabela: (Whistles) Touchy...
───────
Aveline: You know, Isabela, if someone had told me that I'd put up with you for all these years, I'd have punched them flat.
Isabela: And if someone had told me I'd still be here, I'd have done the same. 6161202
(If No Rest for the Wicked has been completed and Isabela blackmailed Castillon)

Aveline: You have your ship, what's stopping you?
(Otherwise)

Aveline: Save your bits, you'll have your ship one day. 6161208
Isabela: And what would you do without me as a constant headache in the Rose? 6161211
Aveline: Someone would rush to fill the hole. You know, like you never left. 6161214
Isabela: That's my girl. 6155658
Aveline: Maybe you win once in a while. 6171273
───────

Aveline and Merrill
Act 1
Merrill: You must really like the Hawke family. 6136647
Aveline: Why do you say that? 6166963
Merrill: You came all the way from Lothering with them, didn't you? And they're not even your clan.
Aveline: Humans don't have clans, Merrill. 6166969
Merrill: Exactly! You came so far together, and you didn't even have a Keeper to make you get along. 6166972
Aveline: So your Keeper tells you to stop kicking each other, or she'll turn the aravel around? 6166975
Merrill: Sometimes she also warns us to stop pulling hair. 6166978
───────
Merrill: I would like to know more about being a guard, Aveline. 6163114
Aveline: I don't think that's the job for you. 6163117
Merrill: I know, but it might help me not get caught. 6163120
Aveline: You probably shouldn't have said that part. 6163123
Merrill: Why? 6062818
Aveline: Just... never mind. 6163129
───────
Merrill: Did Lothering have an alienage? 6136648
Aveline: It wasn't a big enough village to have a wall around it, let alone a place for elves. 6167037
Merrill: Where did the elves live, then? 6167040
Aveline: Stables and outbuildings, mostly. 6167043
Merrill: I think I like alienages better. 6167046
───────
Merrill: Why don't you arrest us, Aveline? 6163133
Aveline: What? 6015974
Merrill: We break the law. I'm pretty sure. There are laws for almost everything. You're not a bad guard, are you? 6163139
Aveline: No! 6001013
(If on a friendship path with Merrill)

Merrill: That's good. Is it because you're fond of Hawke? I kind of am. 6163145
Aveline: How very nice for you. Keep it to yourself. 6163148
Merrill: I'd rather keep it with her/him.
(If on a rivalry path with Merrill)

Merrill: That's good. You look uncomfortable. Did I say something wrong again? 6163153
Aveline: No, Merrill, that's fine. 6163156
Merrill: Ah, maybe it's your shoes.
───────
Act 2
Aveline: You're incredibly talented, Merrill. I can see you are meant for great things. 6163163
Merrill: Thank you! 6043808
Aveline: But... You're stupid.
Merrill: I'm sorry, what? 6163172
Aveline: Don't you think it would be better to work on where you are now, instead of recreating old glory? 6163175
Merrill: No. No, that's kind of the opposite of what I've been saying. I'm the stupid one? Whatever. 6163178
───────
Merrill: The Qunari must like it here, to stay so long. 6136649
Aveline: From what I've seen, the Qunari don't like anything. 6167053
Merrill: That can't be true. They must like some things... Sunshine? Butterflies? Rainbows?
Aveline: If I spot a Qunari admiring butterflies, Merrill, you'll be the first person I tell. 6167065
───────
(After completing The Long Road)

Merrill: (Giggles)
Aveline: Yes? 6068438
Merrill: Is it like you thought? It's nice, isn't it? He seems nice. 6163188
Aveline: Yes, he's very nice. 6163191
Merrill: I know! And you're so cute when you're with him! Not like normal-you at all! 6163194
Aveline: Haven't you got something unholy to do? 6163197
Merrill: No, we're following Hawke. That's important, too. 6163200
───────
(If you complete Mirror Image)

Aveline: This mirror of yours — what does it do?
Merrill: Mostly it stands in my house, looking a bit spooky. 6167109
Aveline: But its magic, right? So it can do... Magic things? Is it dangerous?
Merrill: It could fall on someone, but you'd have to push it really hard. It's quite heavy.
Aveline: Merrill, is it a danger to the people of Kirkwall or not? 6167118
Merrill: Oh! Only to anyone sitting right under it. 6167121
───────
Act 3
Merrill: Aveline, you'll look after Hawke, won't you? 6167150
Aveline: The champion of Kirkwall doesn't need my protection (Rivarly with Hawke)
Aveline: Of course I will. What kind of a question is that? (Friendship with Hawke)
Merrill: And sometimes Isabela gets into awful trouble. You'll watch out for her, too? 6167187
Aveline: Merrill... what brought this on? 6167193
Merrill: Anything could happen. You'll protect them, though. It's what you do. 6167196
Aveline: There's nothing to worry about, Merrill. 6167199
───────
Merrill: Aveline, what's in your mirror? 6163204
Aveline: What do you mean? 6013321
Merrill: In your mirror. What do you see? 6163210
Aveline: A warrior. A wife. All the mistakes I made to get here and make it right. 6163213
Aveline: Why? What have you decided to see? 6163219
(If after A New Path and Merrill decided to break the Eluvian)

Merrill: My mirror is broken. But I think... I think I see good things. 6163222
Merrill: Maybe a headband...
(If after A New Path and Merrill did not break the Eluvian)

Merrill: Demons. And... cracks. 6163226
(Otherwise)

Merrill: Sometimes it's hard to tell. Cracks, mostly. 6163229
Merrill: Maybe I'll borrow yours sometime. If that's all right? 6163232
Aveline: It's all right. 6150385
───────
Aveline: I didn't expect you to stick around for this mess Merrill. This has nothing to do with your elves.
(If Hawke is romancing Merrill)

Merrill: I love Hawke, I wouldn't go anywhere.
Aveline: But it's not your fight. 6163245
Merrill: I love Hawke. 6163248
Aveline: You said that. 6163251
Merrill: I say it a lot. It makes things clearer, takes away doubt when everything is crazy and people are dying.
Aveline: I understand. 6025799
Merrill: Oh, good. Someone should.
(If not romanced)

Merrill: Everything affects everything. We were born, a bunch of things happened, and now we're in a mess with our friends. 6163281
Aveline: That seems too simple. 6163284
Merrill: Simple is good. It sneaks up on you, makes you smile. 6163287
Merrill: Maybe that should be enough once in a while. 6163297
Aveline: Simple it is. 6163300
(If after A New Path)

Aveline: That seems too simple. 6163284
Merrill: Simple is good. It sneaks up on you, makes you smile. 6163287
Merrill: Or it says "Hey over there!" And kills with a pin.
Aveline: Merrill? 6034311
Merrill: Simple Aveline. Not stupid.
───────
Merrill: Aveline... do you think we'll win? 6136651
Aveline: Win what? 6167854
Merrill: In the end. It feels like something is ending, doesn't it? Do you think we'll win? 6167857
Aveline: Nothing is ending, Merrill. Things are a little tense, but it will pass. 6167860
Merrill: I hope we win. Varric will make it a good story, I'm sure. 6168321
───────
(During A New Path)

Aveline: What should we be prepared for if something goes wrong? 6142631
Merrill: I'm not entirely sure. I've never seen an abomination myself. The keeper said they... warp and change before your eyes.
Aveline: So you want us to come along and watch for something, but you don't know what?
Merrill: It's just a precaution, Aveline. Nothing will go wrong.
Aveline: Oh. That's reassuring.

Aveline and Sebastian
Act 2
Sebastian: I understand you are of noble birth. 6172767
Aveline: My father was a chevalier. He had to flee Orlais when his patron was murdered. 6172770
Sebastian: I'm sorry. 6030492
Aveline: I wouldn't have been suited for the life of an Orlesian noblewoman, anyway. 6172776
Sebastian: But surely you wish it had been different? To be a lady of Orlais and not a... city guardsman? 6172779
Aveline: Not for one moment. 6172782
Aveline: I'd rather kill a bandit and save a merchant's family than know the correct dance steps and which rouge is in fashion. 6172785
───────
Sebastian: I hope this wasn't presumptuous, but I added your husband's name to the memorial wall in the Chantry.
Aveline: Wesley? But... you never knew him. 6172789
Sebastian: He was a templar. He refused to abandon the people of Ferelden to the Blight. He died too young. 6172792
Sebastian: The grand cleric will read his name during the Chant of Remembrance. 6172795
Aveline: Thank you. That is... very kind. 6172798
Sebastian: He walks with the Maker. But it is no shame for those left behind to mourn. 6172801
───────
Aveline: So you're a prince, are you?
Sebastian: That is apparently true. 6171029
Aveline: There's doubt? 6171032
Sebastian: I've accepted the burden. That's all that matters. Why do you ask, Guard-Captain? 6171035
Aveline: The entitled types are always trouble. 6171038
Sebastian: In that case, I'm glad I don't count myself as one. 6171041
Aveline: They never do. 6171044
───────
Sebastian: You don't like me, Guard-Captain? 6171048
Aveline: I've no issue, so long as the fight over your title remains in Starkhaven. Exactly like it hasn't.
Sebastian: Should I apologize for trying to take back what is rightfully mine? 6171054
Aveline: Whatever it takes? No matter the cost? 6171057
Sebastian: It feels like your're blaming me for some personal experience of yours.
Aveline: I was at Ostagar. Good people die when leaders "do whatever it takes."
Sebastian: Good people know the necessity. 6171066
───────
(Once you complete Repentance)

Sebastian: What have I done now? You look like you wish to scold me. 6172802
Aveline: I just can't fathom why you're still in Kirkwall. 6172805
Aveline: For six years you've been claiming you'll retake your parent's lands.
Aveline: You're smart, you'd be a capable ruler. What are you waiting for? 6172811
Sebastian: I don't know if it's the right thing to do. 6172817
Aveline: Do we ever get to know that? 6172820
───────
(Once you complete Repentance)

Aveline: Has Starkhaven called for its lost prince, Sebastian? Would you give up if the city has moved on? 6171070
Sebastian: Like Ferelden "moved on" after Cailan?
Aveline: You've been reading. 6171076
(If Alistair was made king)

Sebastian: It's a good tale. King Alistair is particularly inspiring. But I doubt that's how you see me. 6171079
(Otherwise)

Sebastian: It's a good tale. I'm inspired by the Warden Alistair. But I doubt that's how you see me.
(If on rivalry path)

Sebastian: I'm no tyrant, Aveline. If people die restoring me to my place, they'll do it knowing the risk. If that doesn't satisfy, so be it.
Aveline: After your actions here? No, it doesn't.
(If on friendship path)

Sebastian: I don't intend to let anyone die restoring me to my place, Aveline. The risks are mine. And that will have to satisfy. 6171085
Aveline: It was well said, I give you that. We'll see. 6178585
───────
Act 3
Aveline: Are you loyal, Prince? 6171098
Sebastian: Guard-Captain? 6095433
Aveline: To Kirkwall. Are you loyal? 6171104
Aveline: You're set on a title in Starkhaven, but we're having a crisis here. 6171130
Sebastian: This isn't just Kirkwall's concern. If this chaos spreads, Starkhaven will need a strong ruler to beat back the tide.
Aveline: I've seen greater men than you use that excuse. 6171136
Sebastian: Noted and ignored, Captain. 6171139
───────
Sebastian: Do you have many dealings with the knight-commander? 6172821
Aveline: Please don't start with that. I'm not a templar. I'm the captain of the guard. 6172824
Aveline: We arrest burglars. The knight-commander never gives us a thought. 6172827
Sebastian: Grand Cleric Elthina is worried about her. She's stopped taking the Chantry's advice. 6172830
Aveline: Her job's not easy. Certain... forces in the city are allied against her. 6172833
(If Anders is in the party)

Anders: Don't try to be subtle. I'm right here. 6172836
Sebastian: Clearly, our templars need strong leaders. 6172839
Aveline: Until something changes, that's Meredith. And we must give her any support we are able. 6172842

Aveline and Varric
Act 1
Aveline: Varric, do you do anything? 6161231
Varric: Am I the next stop in your career evaluations? Joy of joys. 6161234
Aveline: You watch and you talk. Is that it? 6161237
Varric: You are dismissing hallmarks of both the utterly ineffectual and the incredibly dangerous. 6161240
Aveline: I don't know what you mean. 6161243
Varric: It means coins flow when I talk and when I shut up. Like if you got paid to guard or unguard. 6161246
Aveline: That makes no sense. 6161249
Varric: Good. 6080990
───────
Aveline: Maybe I should put you to use Varric. Have you pen some warnings for the lawless.
Varric: Who's that for? Are most criminals big readers? Seems like pacifying the nobles.
Aveline: Pictures then. It was just a suggestion. 6161262
Varric: Well how about a giant sign that just says "Don't." You could hit people with it.
Aveline: Thank you, I get the point. 6161268
───────
Varric: A Fereldan in the guard. What will they think of next? 6136700
Aveline: You have a problem with that? 6170554
Varric: Me? My family's not native either. I'm just surprised. Lots of old prejudice in the guard. 6170557
Aveline: I'll give them plenty of reason to change their minds. 6170560
Varric: You know, it's possible they're just scared shitless of you. That's my theory, anyway. 6170563
───────
Varric: So what do you do, Aveline? 6136701
Aveline: You know I'm a guard, why are you asking? 6170566
Varric: I mean in your off-duty hours. For fun. You've heard of it, I hope? 6170569
Aveline: These are my off-duty hours. 6170572
Varric: And the trend of you scaring the piss out of me continues. 6170575
───────
Act 2
Aveline: Blondie, Sunshine, Daisy, Rivaini... What am I?
Varric: Beg your pardon? 6165472
Aveline: You don't call anyone by name except for me. Where's my nickname? 6170582
Varric: That's not true. There's Hawke. And Bianca. 6170585
Aveline: "Hawke" is a family name and Bianca is a crossbow. Don't change the subject.
Varric: Haven't thought of a good one yet. What do you think of "Red?"
Aveline: Too common. 6170594
Varric: Well, when you think of one, let me know. 6170597
───────
Aveline: You, Varric, have a very large mouth. 6161272
Varric: And here I've always looked up to you. What is it now? 6161275
Aveline: There were fistfights in the barracks over who is the model for your guard serial. 6161278
Varric: Hard in Hightown. Riveting stuff. Everyone loves a dirty guard on the edge. 6161281
Aveline: Varric. 6149247
Varric: Fine. I'll start his big finish. Three chapters until Donnen Brennicovick retires and opens a tavern on the coast. 6161287
Varric: I sure hope he makes it. He's getting too old for this shit. 6171168
───────
Aveline: You are very close to losing your printing blocks, Varric. 6161291
Varric: Once more I am falsely accused of whatever it is that I am accused of. Falsely. 6161294
Aveline: Someone swapped the text of my recruitment poster with some filth from the Blooming Rose. 6161297
Varric: That does sound pretty good. 6161300
Aveline: Sure, fill barracks with whores. But you've also filled the Rose with guards.
Varric: It is true what they say. The best comedy comes from tragedy.
───────
Aveline: You know the Tethras family businesses are registered in your cousin Elmand's name? 6136703
Varric: You don't say? 6157193
Aveline: But I can't find any record of you having a cousin Elmand. 6170627
Varric: I'll introduce you some time. He's a little on the shy side. 6170630
Aveline: Varric. He's imaginary. 6170633
Varric: Which makes him a much better head of the household than I am. He never misses the Merchants Guild meetings, for one. 6170636
───────
Act 3
Aveline: You're too quiet, Varric. 6161310
Varric: I'm thinking of switching to romances. Nothing? Not even a foreboding frown? 6161313
(Only if The Long Road has been completed)

Aveline: I am content. Write what you will. 6161316
Varric: Well that certainly takes the fun out of it. Contentment in the barracks? Who'll pay to hear that shit? 6161319
Aveline: Then I should have thought of it years ago. 6161322
(Otherwise)

Aveline: Do what you will. I don't care. 6161323
Varric: That is... not a comforting thought. 6161326
Aveline: It is what it is. I'm used to it. 6161329
Varric: I think we've both lost some inspiration. 6161332
───────
Aveline: Why are you still here, Varric? 6136704
Varric: Starkhaven's too pretentious for me and Cumberland's too boring. 6170639
Aveline: You always say you hate commitment, but here you are, six years later, still at Hawke's side. 6170642
Varric: Aveline, I thought you'd have noticed by now: I lie a lot. 6170645
───────
Aveline: Strange, I always thought I'd wind up arresting you some day. 6136705
Varric: If I ever decide to get caught, Aveline, you'll be the guard I let catch me. 6170690
Aveline: "Let catch you?"
Varric: "Decide to get caught" didn't trip you up though. Good to know!
───────
Aveline: How are you at finales, Varric? 6161336
Varric: I'm expecting some practical experience fairly soon. 6161339
Aveline: Make it a good one, will you? 6161342
Varric: For you, madam, endless sunsets and roses. 6161345
Aveline: Varric. 6149247
Varric: And the swift hand of the law sweeping all aside. I thought it went unsaid. 6161351
Bethany and Fenris
Fenris: You've been an apostate your whole life, then? 6141769
Bethany: Like my father before me. What of it? 6141772
Fenris: Didn't your family consider that dangerous? 6141775
Bethany: There are mages who go their whole lives without ever falling prey to a demon. Many of them, in fact. 6141778
Fenris: And if the Templars came looking for you? That would not be danger enough?
Bethany: Perhaps there shouldn't be any Templars.
───────
Fenris: You know, you cannot wish the Templars away.
Bethany: I can try. 6141792
Fenris: Is the Circle here truly so terrible an option? 6141795
Bethany: Do you really have to ask that? 6141798
Fenris: You would be kept safe from others as well as yourself, and they would be kept safe from you.
Bethany: I... didn't ask for this. 6141804
Fenris: Nobody asks for their fate. 6141807
───────
Bethany: Do you ever miss Tevinter? 6136461
Fenris: I was a slave. 6151284
Bethany: Still, it was your home, right? The only one you remember? 6151287
Bethany: Does it ever feel strange not to be there? 6151290
Fenris: Sometimes. That does not mean I would go back. 6151293
───────
Bethany: So, the magister put lyrium in your skin? 6136462
Fenris: So I'm told. 6151296
Bethany: Does it hurt? 6151299
Fenris: You do not want to know the answer to that. 6151302
Bethany and Isabela
Bethany: What were you before you were a pirate? 6136466
Isabela: I had a husband. He didn't beat me, that's about the best I can say about it. 6151305
Bethany: So you left him? 6151308
Isabela: He was murdered. By my lover. It was all very... Antivan. 6151311
Bethany: Oh. I don't think I'd like to live in Antiva. 6151314
───────
Bethany: So you've... been with women. In bed? 6155712
Isabela: I know. Shocking, isn't it? 6155715
Isabela: You see, sweetness, men are only good for one thing. Women are good for six. 6155718
Bethany: Six? Which six? 6155721
Hawke: Isabela! 6041492
Isabela: (Laughs)
───────
Bethany: I guess you've been with a lot of men. 6136467
Isabela: Men. Women. Elves. A dwarf in drag once, but I don't recommend that. 6151320
Bethany: Oh. 6064992
Isabela: Aw... you're blushing! Why? How many lovers have you had? 6151326
Bethany: I-I never— 6151329
Isabela: You're a virgin? Hawke, you've been holding out on the poor girl! Get her a night at the Blooming Rose. On me! 6151332
Bethany: That's, um, very generous. 6151335
Isabela: I'm a giver. 6151338
───────
Bethany: That book you were reading this morning, "Hessarian's Spear"— I don't think he had a spear in the legends.
Isabela: He does in this one. Read the description. 6155736
Bethany: "Andraste knelt before no man but her Maker, but she hadn't counted on the archon Hessarian."
Bethany: "Can Hessarian penetrate the tight-knit defenses of the warrior-prophetess? Will she be prepared to face the full blast of his... power?"
Bethany: Wait a minute... Isabela! This is a vulgar thing! 6155745
Isabela: You want to borrow it? 6155748
Bethany: No! 6001013
Isabela: You sure? It has pictures! 6155754
Bethany: Not listening! I'm not listening! 6155757
───────
((When entering the barracks in the Viscount's Keep)

Isabela: Coming here of my own free will feels wrong... Like diddling a sister.
Bethany: Why? Why do you say these things? 6172004
Bethany and Merrill
Bethany: So, there's no Circle among the Dalish? 6136471
Merrill: Any child with the gift of magic is apprenticed to a Keeper... in another clan if there's no need in her own. 6151341
Bethany: That sounds nice. 6151344
Merrill: Magic is a gift of the Creators. Why wouldn't we use it? 6151347
Merrill: It just seems... wasteful for humans to lock their mages away where they can't do any good. 6151350
(If Fenris is in the party)

Fenris: Of course, you're a blood mage. 6151353
Bethany: Oh. Right. 6149214
(Otherwise)

Bethany: But... you are a blood mage. 6151357
───────
Bethany: So, is the Keeper... your mother? 6136472
Merrill: I left my clan when I was a child to become Marethari's First. 6151360
Merrill: I haven't seen my parents in more than ten years. 6151363
Bethany: I'm so sorry! My father died in the Blight. You must really miss them. 6151366
Merrill: I remember my mother singing to me, when I was a little girl and I'd get sick. I think that's what I miss the most. 6151369
Merrill: The Keeper has a terrible singing voice. 6151372
───────
Merrill: You're so lucky. 6136656
Bethany: How do you figure? 6164775
Merrill: I wish I had a brother/sister and a mother and an uncle.
Merrill: It must be wonderful. You'd never be alone! 6164784
Bethany: It is wonderful. Although it might be better without Uncle Gamlen. 6164787
───────
Merrill: If you could do anything - just anything at all - what would you do?
Bethany: That's easy. Be normal. No magic, just... normal. 6164841
Merrill: Really? You wouldn't fly across Thedas or eat a cake the size of Kirkwall? Keep a baby griffon for a pet? 6164844
Bethany: Well, now that you say it, the griffon might not be so bad. 6164847
Merrill: I'd name mine "Feathers."
Bethany and Varric
Bethany: You don't seem to like your brother very much. 6136476
Varric: And here I thought it took blood magic to read minds. 6151447
Bethany: I had a twin brother, Carver. He used to nail my braid to the bed while I was sleeping. 6151450
Bethany: I never thought I'd miss him this much. 6151453
Varric: Sorry about your brother. 6151456
Varric: Hey, you want mine? I've got a spare... 6151459
───────
Bethany: Do you ever wish you lived in Orzammar? 6136477
Varric: Great Ancestors, no! You know what Orzammar is? 6151462
Varric: It's cramped tunnels, filled with nug-shit and body-odor. 6151465
Varric: And every person there thinks he's better than you because his great-great-great grandfather made a water-clock or something. 6151468
Bethany: But they're your people. Don't you even wonder what it would be like? 6151471
Varric: I have a good imagination. Why would I waste it on that? 6151474
───────
Bethany: Are you really not afraid of apostates? Not even a little? 6136709
Varric: Sunshine, I'm a dwarf. In case you missed that detail.
Bethany: Dwarves aren't completely immune to magic, you know. 6164555
Varric: Who has time to worry about apostates with a Merchant's Guild breathing down your neck?
Bethany: In that case... I see. 6164564
───────
Bethany: Your family used to be noble, right? 6164652
Varric: By some definition of the term. 6164751
Bethany: Do you ever wonder what your life would have been like, if you were still nobles? 6164754
Varric: Sunshine, nobility is just an expensive lifestyle. I've already got one of those. 6164757
Bethany: Nobles have power, too. And responsibilities. 6164760
Varric: Estates, servants, investments, mercenaries, assassins? We've still got all those things. 6164769
Varric: It's sunnier here, and nobody calls me my lord. I think I can live with that. 6164772
───────
Only if Birthright has been completed:

Varric: So... Milady Sunshine, what's your first act as a noblewoman going to be? 6136710
Bethany: A noblewoman with no fortune and no title? Looking for work, probably. 6164720
Varric: Practicality is for peasants, my lady. You need to do something frivolous to celebrate your birthright. 6164730
Bethany: Such as...? 6139296
Varric: Come up to the Hightown Market and complain bitterly that there's no Orlesian silk that matches your eyes. 6164736
Bethany: But what if something does match my eyes? What will I do, then? 6164739
Varric: Insist that they're blatantly copying you, and demand royalties. A good noble always has a complaint ready, Sunshine. 6164742
Carver and Fenris
Carver: So... this master of yours wants your markings back? Skin and all? 6141812
Fenris: So his hunters told me. Unwillingly. 6141815
Carver: So why not cover them up? Wouldn't that make you harder to find? 6141818
Fenris: Let them come. I am not one to hide. 6141821
Carver: Still, if it were me— 6141824
Fenris: It's not. 6141827
───────
Carver: So you've really never thought of hiding from those hunters? 6141832
Fenris: To what end? 6141835
Carver: So you could, I don't know, have a life? 6141838
Fenris: What life do you have? There are no hunters after you at all. 6141841
Carver: I have a life! 6141844
Fenris: One that you complain about. We are not always free to do as we wish, as you should well know. 6141847
Carver: I do have a life. 6141850
Fenris: Then I stand corrected. 6105589
───────
Carver: You're very different from other elves. 6148699
Fenris: Oh? You know them all? 6148702
Carver: No. I just... you look different. There's no denying that. 6148705
Fenris: It is what I am. And unlike the problems you claim to have, I really did have no choice. 6148708
Carver: Do we know anyone who isn't brooding every hour of the day? 6148711
Fenris: Like attracts like, it seems. 6148714
───────
Carver: You know, Fenris, I have a tattoo. 6148717
Fenris: You have a what? 6148720
Carver: A tattoo. A lot of us got them before Ostagar. It's a Mabari. For strength.
Fenris: Does it curse you with the ability to reach into a man and tear out his insides? 6148726
Carver: Uh. I can make it bark. 6148729
Fenris: Please don't. 6116745
(Next line depends on the third companion present)

Anders: Yes, refrain.
Aveline: Agreed. 6000801
Isabela: Rather see it wag. 6148738
Merrill: That's... ew. 6148739
Varric: Seconded. 6148735
Hawke: (Sighs)

Carver and Isabela
Isabela: I saw you at the Blooming Rose the other night. 6148761
Carver: What? No you didn't. 6149172
Isabela: I suppose someone else stole your chin to romance Faith?
Carver: (Scoffs) That's unlikely. She wasn't even working.
Isabela: Mm-hmm. Got you. 6149181
(The next line changes depending on your third party member)

Aveline: Carver! 6036564
Varric: Oh ho! Nicely done. 6149187
Merrill: I don't get it. 6149190
(If one of the previous lines didn't trigger, and Hawke has not slept with anyone in the Blooming Rose)

Hawke: Carver, what would Mother say? 6149193
Carver: You're just... that's not what I... shit! 6149196
───────
Carver: So, Isabela. You captained a ship? That's a lot of men to handle. For you to command. 6148743
Isabela: Well aren't you just adorable fumbling for a topic. 6148746
Carver: You say that like I'm harmless. 6148749
Isabela: As harmless as a pup that will someday grow into its fangs and sink them deep. 6148752
Carver: Sure, keep teasing. I'll show you how much of a pup I am. 6148755
Isabela: I know. That's why I do it. 6148758
───────
Isabela: You look like a man I once dueled. 6155766
Isabela: He was a little intimated by my reputation as a vicious pirate, but rose to the challenge.
Carver: He looked like me, you say? 6155772
Isabela: It went on all night, under the stars, the waves lapping at our ankles. 6155775
Carver: On the beach? In the surf? How did you get proper footing? 6155778
Isabela: We didn't. There was quite a bit of tumbling around, and we were soaked and sore by the time the sun came up. 6155781
Carver: Did you... win? 6155784
Isabela: I managed to get on top in the end, but I considered it a tie. 6155787
───────
Carver: Why is it always about sex with you? 6155796
Isabela: It's not. Sometimes it's about sex with other people. 6155799
Carver: You see? It comes up every single time we talk. 6155802
Isabela: We're just talking, Carver. If it comes up, that's not my fault. 6155805
Carver: What? I mean... that's not what I meant. It... it doesn't! 6155808
Carver: I hate you so much. 6155811

Carver and Merrill
Carver: So, you're not like a lot of other girls. 6149199
Merrill: No, I'm an elf. 6149202
Carver: Right, alright then.
Merrill: Oh, did I miss something dirty?
Carver: What? No! It wasn't dirty. It wasn't anything. 6149211
Merrill: Oh? Right, because I miss a lot of dirty things and sometimes I wouldn't mind hearing them.
Carver: Would you now? 6149220
───────
Carver: Your people came a long way Merrill, but I like to think that we have Ferelden in common.
Merrill: I never saw Lothering. Did you walk as much as we did? Probably more, you didn't start with halla. Our ship stunk. 6149226
Carver: Your ship? 6149229
Merrill: There was something foul in the hold. I can still smell it. 6149232
Carver: Oh, well, that must have been unpleasant.
Merrill: It was. Did I miss something dirty again?
Carver: No. 6015185
───────
Merrill: Do you miss it? Ferelden I mean.
Carver: Sometimes. 6155601
Merrill: Blackberries. They don't seem to grow here. And there were little song birds with black caps on their heads.
Carver: I sort of miss the dogs barking. 6165629
Merrill: Yes... It's been mostly humans barking at me here. Not nearly as cute.
───────
Merrill: How did you learn swording? 6136662
Carver: "Swording"?
Merrill: Those things you do with the sword. It looks tricky. Was it hard to learn? 6165620
Carver: It takes a lot of practice. 6165623
Merrill: Well, you seem good at it! I bet one day you'll be best sworder in Kirkwall.
Carver: Merrill... 6114827
Merrill: I said something wrong again, didn't I? Maybe I'll just stop talking. 6165662

Carver and Varric
Varric: You know, Junior, it's eerie how much of a resemblance there is between you two.
Carver:
(If Hawke is male) We're brothers. What's eerie about that?
(If Hawke is female) She's my sister. Of course there's a resemblance.
Varric: Ooh, you thought I meant Hawke. I was talking about Gamlen.
Carver: Maker, I hate you dwarf.
───────

Carver: Don't look at me.
Varric: What's your issue now, little Hawke? 6149303
Carver: Don't call me...just don't alright? You're just looking for fodder for your stories.
Varric: You think you're that interesting? 6149309
Carver: I have enough trouble being overshadowed as it is. I don't need to get caught under an imaginary me, too.
Varric: Don't you worry. I'm not in the business of lullabies or children's stories. 6149318
───────

Carver: I'm surprised these tunnels don't simply collapse. 6153896
Varric: Dwarves made them. 6154994
Carver: Then I'm surprised they're not smaller. 6154997
───────

Varric: You know, Junior, you're looking at this all wrong. 6136715
Carver: Whatever it is you're about to say, I'm not interested. 6164490
Varric: I'm a professional younger brother. Trust me, the center of attention's the worst place to be. 6164493
Varric: When things go wrong, and they always do, that's where all the fingers point. Look at any kingdom in Thedas. 6164496
Varric: You've got people who warm thrones, and people nobody sees who do the real work. 6164499
Carver:
(If Hawke is male) So my brother is a king now? Just what he needed.
(If Hawke is female) And my sister is a queen in this scenario. Perfect.
Varric: Point. Missing it. Ah well. 6164508
───────

Carver: Varric. 6149247
Varric: Carver. 6149288
Carver: Still think you're helping while burying us in debt to your brother? 6149291
Varric: Still riding side-saddle while bitching at your betters? 6149294
Carver: Drinks later? 6149297
Varric: Never miss'em.

Fenris and Isabela
Act 1
Isabela: So what's with that magical fisting thing you do? 6155835
Fenris: I'm... sorry? 6155838
Isabela: You know, when you stick your hand into people. 6155841
Fenris: Oh. That. Yes. It's a... talent. 6155844
Isabela: You could make so much coin with that. 6155847
───────
Isabela: This one time, I was sailing to Llomerryn, and there was a fight between two of my men. 6155853
Isabela: It was over a dice game, or the last piece of toast, or something. Sailors—they're touchy about their toast. 6155856
Fenris: Is this going anywhere? 6107695
Isabela: It will if you let me finish. 6155862
Isabela: So, there's a knife fight, and Jim ends up with a broken-off blade stuck in his shoulder. 6155865
Isabela: It's buried deep in there, and we're out at sea, at least a week from the nearest port. 6155868
Isabela: If you were there, you could've reached in and plucked that blade right from his flesh. 6155871
Fenris: That's your whole point? 6155874
Isabela: Pretty much. 6155877
───────
Isabela: I enjoy a man with markings like that. 6141858
Fenris: You've enjoyed many, I suspect. 6141861
Isabela: Where I come from, they're called "tattoos." Sailors get them all the time.
Fenris: Not made of lyrium, I'd imagine. 6141867
Isabela: Not a one. And the pictures are different—usually breasts. 6141870
Fenris: I suppose a pair of lyrium breasts tattooed onto my chest would make things better. 6141873
Isabela: That's me. I'm a helper. 6141876
───────
Fenris: So this relic you mentioned losing... 6141881
Isabela: You have pretty eyes. 6141884
Fenris: I... have pretty eyes. 6141887
Isabela: You elves have such pretty eyes, even the men. It makes me want to pluck them out and wear them as a necklace. 6141890
Fenris: I wouldn't suggest trying. 6141893
Isabela: Oh, I would never try. Not without reason, of course. 6141896
Fenris: Forget I said anything. 6141899
───────
Fenris: So you freed a group of slaves?
Isabela: Would-be slaves. They weren't slaves yet. 6155823
Fenris: Still, you did the right thing. Many would turn a blind eye. 6155826
Isabela: Don't read too much into it, all right? It just seemed a good idea at the time. 6155829
───────
Act 2
Fenris: So I hear you think mages should be free. 6155883
Isabela: Everyone should be free. Not just mages. 6155886
Fenris: Not everyone's dangerous. 6155889
Isabela: It's not about who's dangerous. It's about having choices made for you. 6155892
Isabela: Don't you wish you had the choice not to have lyrium stuck under your skin? 6155895
Fenris: I do. 6134902
Isabela: (Sighs) This is silly. I don't want to argue.
Fenris: Do you want to guess what color my underclothes are again? 6171554
Isabela: Oh, yes, that's much more fun. 6171557
───────
Fenris: You keep staring at me. Is it my eyes again? 6141904
Isabela: You're very lanky, for an elf. I like lanky. 6141907
Fenris: From what I gather, you like a lot of things. 6141910
Isabela: Nonsense. But when I see something I like, I go after it. 6141913
(If Hawke is romancing Fenris)

Fenris: I suggest keeping your distance. 6141916
Isabela: Now you're just making it challenging. 6141919
(Otherwise)

Fenris: Do you intend to go after me, then? 6141922
Isabela: Will you take off all that spiky armor you're wearing? 6141925
Fenris: It's been known to happen. 6141928
Isabela: Then forget it. 6141931
───────
Isabela: So what duties did you have? As a slave, I mean? 6143095
Fenris: Not this again. 6143098
Isabela: I heard that Tevinter slaves are kept oiled so they glisten. Did your master oil you up? Did you glisten for him? 6143101
Fenris: I was his bodyguard. 6143104
Isabela: Always close at hand. Always within reach. Glistening. 6143107
Fenris: You have an entire story written in your head already, don't you? 6143110
Isabela: Mmm. 6056856
───────
(In front of The Hanged Man)

Fenris: I still don't get the name. Did they hang someone here? 6153428
Isabela: It means being drunk. 6154155
(If Varric is in the party)

Varric: Actually they used to hang men there. By their feet. Till they starved to death.
Fenris: Well, good thing they were drunk then.
───────
Act 3
Isabela: You seem especially broody today. 6155907
Fenris: Does it bother you? Should I stop? 6155910
Isabela: No, don't stop. But could you add some smoldering to the routine? Just for me?
Fenris: Smolder? 6155916
Isabela: Oh, and while you're at it, perhaps some cold insolence. 6155919
Fenris: You want me to smolder and be cold at the same time? Those don't go together... 6155922
Isabela: Shush. Don't distract me with your logic. 6155925
───────
Fenris: So you engaged a Qunari dreadnaught in battle.
Isabela: They engaged me in battle. I was just trying to get away. 6141939
Isabela: Sailing into the storm was a gamble. Took care of the Qunari, but it did us in too. Can't win them all.
Fenris: Where I come from, we would call that insanity. 6141945
Isabela: Nothing ventured, nothing gained. 6141948
───────
Fenris: I still can't believe Hawke saved you. 6143116
Isabela: You've been saying that for years. Would you have turned me over to the Qunari? 6143119
Fenris: No, but I know what they do to their prisoners. 6143122
Isabela: Execute them horribly, I imagine. 6143125
Fenris: The Qunari waste nothing. They would reeducate you into a loyal follower of the Qun. 6143128
Isabela: Pfft. Could I refuse? 6143131
Fenris: There's always qamek, which turns you into a mindless laborer. Like I said, they waste nothing. 6143134
Isabela: Oh. 6064992
Fenris: If you wish to thank Hawke, he's/she's standing right there.
───────
(If neither is in a romance with Hawke)

Isabela: That night...I can't stop thinking about it.
Fenris: Well, then I'll see you later. 6155934
Isabela: That was direct. 6155937
Fenris: I thought I'd get straight to the point. Were you expecting flowers or something? 6159426
Isabela: Don't be absurd. 6155943
Fenris: Then I'll see you tonight. 6155946

Fenris and Merrill
Act 1
Merrill: You've probably never met a Dalish before, have you? 6136666
Fenris: I wouldn't know. 6167863
Merrill: I'm sure you'd be able to tell. Dalish aren't much like the elves in the cities. 6167866
Fenris: The smug sense of superiority does give you away. 6167912
───────
Merrill: Certainly your people have stories about the Dalish. No? 6136667
Fenris: My people? 6167949
Merrill: The elves in Tevinter. They must have heard of us. 6167952
Fenris: They've heard. They just don't care. 6167955
Merrill: But if they ran away, the Dalish would help them. 6167958
Fenris: You might as well say, "If they flew into the sky, they could live in the clouds."
Merrill: What would they eat in the clouds? There's nothing there but fluff and the occasional bird. 6167964
Fenris: This is why nobody takes the Dalish seriously. 6167979
───────
(After you bring Fenris to the Gallows for the first time)

Fenris: Why are you watching me like that? 6143148
Merrill: You have vallaslin. The same markings that the Dalish have. 6143151
Fenris: Yours are not made of lyrium. 6143154
Merrill: No, they're made of blood. Our blood. That's what vallaslin means: blood writing. It's a mark of adulthood. 6143157
Fenris: Mine were carved into my flesh against my will, in a ritual I remember only for the agony it caused me. 6143160
Merrill: I'm... so sorry. 6143163
───────
Fenris: I don't want your pity. 6143168
Merrill: Are you talking to me? 6143171
Fenris: You said you were sorry about the ritual I endured. Keep your sorrow. 6143174
Merrill: I only meant— 6143177
Fenris: You have all the freedom none of our kind enjoy, and you throw it away. On what?
Merrill: Our people need to reclaim their heritage. 6143183
Fenris: A heritage of defeat? To what end? 6143186
Merrill: Would you truly turn your back on your own history? There's so much we don't know... 6143189
Fenris: It's not my history. It's simply history. 6143192
───────
Fenris: Tampering around in mud all day, how do the Dalish do it?
Merrill: Do you like the crowded cities better?
Fenris: It's a smell I'm more familiar with, yes.
───────
Act 2
Merrill: You never come to the alienage, Fenris. 6143198
Fenris: I don't live in the alienage. 6143201
Merrill: Don't you care about the plight of our people? Not even a little bit? 6143204
Fenris: I don't need to visit the alienage to know what they suffer. I know it better than you. 6143207
Merrill: I've lived there for years! I see it firsthand! 6143210
Fenris: And I lived it. 6143213
───────
Merrill: Did you step on something sharp, Fenris? 6136668
Fenris: No. 6015185
Merrill: Slam your fingers in a door? 6167985
Fenris: No. 6015185
Merrill: Smack your head on a low beam? 6167991
Fenris: Is there a point to this line of questioning? 6167994
Merrill: Just wondering why you're so cross all the time. 6167997
(If Varric is in the party)

Varric: I think he jabs himself with those spikes, personally. 6168000
Fenris: Perhaps it's the inane prodding. 6173761
───────
(During A Bitter Pill, in the Abandoned Slaver Den, when the Blood Sacrifice is examined)

Fenris: See for yourself. The legacy of the magisters. 6109390
Merrill: They sacrifice the unwilling? 6109393
Fenris: Is that so hard to believe? You are only a step away from it yourself.
Merrill: That's not true. 6109399
Fenris: Believe what you like. In my experience, mages always find a way to justify their need for power. 6109402
───────
(After you complete A Bitter Pill)

Fenris: Avert your eyes, witch. 6143218
Merrill: You said I was dwelling on "useless" history, but what are you doing?
Merrill: The past is important, to you and to all of us. We must know it to move forward. 6143224
Fenris: Yet I have made no deal with a demon to learn of my past. 6143227
Fenris: You had a life. You had a family. And you abandoned them to chase after ghosts. 6143230
Fenris: We are nothing alike. Don't even begin to think that we are. 6143233
───────
(If you complete Mirror Image)

Fenris: You are more naive than I thought. 6143238
Merrill: What have I done to you now? 6143241
Fenris: To me? Nothing. Not yet. 6143244
Fenris: To yourself—you can't even begin to imagine the number of mages that have walked down the path you're now on. 6143247
Merrill: My clan didn't believe in me. If you don't believe in me either, I won't mind. 6143250
───────
(During Mirror Image)

Merrill: Pol... What was he thinking? ... He acted like I was a monster...
Fenris: You are a monster. 6116394
(If Isabela is in the party)

Isabela: You aren't helping.
Fenris: Good. 6080990
───────
Act 3
Merrill: Poor Anders. 6136671
Fenris: You pity him? He's dangerous to himself and everyone around him. 6168909
Merrill: I think he's broken the thing he wanted to save. 6168912
Fenris: You pity him because he's you. 6169052
Merrill: Breaking the things you love most isn't restricted to mages, Fenris. 6169055
Fenris: Sadly true. 6173764
───────
Merrill: Your master must have been a terrible man, to make you hate mages so. 6143255
(If Alone has been completed)

Fenris: He was, now he's dead.
(Otherwise)

Fenris: He is a terrible man. He's not dead. 6143258
Merrill: We're not all like him. 6143264
Fenris: How often I hear that, and yet, how often I find it's not true.
Merrill: The Keepers are different. They exist to preserve the old ways, and to protect our people. 6143270
Fenris: And none of them would ever fall prey to a demon. Or perform blood magic. 6143273
Merrill: It's impossible to talk to you. 6143276
───────
(If Hawke is romancing Fenris)

Merrill: (Giggles)
Fenris: What? Why are you looking at me like that? 6168024
Merrill: You're in love! 6168027
Fenris: I am not. 6168030
Merrill: You keep looking at Hawke with sad puppy eyes every time his back is turned. (male Hawke)
Merrill: Everytime she looks away, you stare at Hawke with those sad puppy eyes. (female Hawke)
Fenris: There are no puppy eyes. 6168039
Merrill: It's all right, you know. Even you can be happy once in a while. It won't kill you. But your face might crack if you smile, so be careful.
───────
(If Alone & Questioning Beliefs has been completed)

Merrill: Do you regret it? What happened with your sister, I mean. 6136670
Fenris: No. 6015185
(If Fenris killed Varania)

Merrill: You don't feel bad about killing her? Not even a little? 6168418
Fenris: It was necessary. 6168601
(Otherwise)

Merrill: You don't wish... that maybe you hadn't found her again? 6168419
Fenris: Whatever I wish, it is already done. 6168545
Merrill: You're lucky, then. There are so many things I wish I could undo. 6168687
───────
(If A New Path has been completed)

Fenris: This... Keeper of yours, she was a friend?
Merrill: She was like a mother to me. To all of us. 6143284
Fenris: Then I'm sorry. 6143287
Merrill: No you're not. She's just one more mage to you. Why would you be sorry she's dead? 6143290
Fenris: I'm not sorry she's dead. I'm only sorry she died for you. 6143293
Merrill: What? 6015974
Fenris: Let's hope the sacrifice of someone who cared for you that much isn't wasted. 6143299

Fenris and Sebastian
Act 2
Sebastian: Are you an Andrastian, Fenris? 6171854
Fenris: If I say no, will you attempt to convert me? 6171857
Sebastian: Many elves believe in the Maker. I ask only because I wonder if your experiences... soured your faith. 6171860
Fenris: My faith was never strong. It's difficult for a slave to have faith in someone who abandoned them. 6171863
Sebastian: The Maker didn't enslave you, Fenris. 6171866
Fenris: He didn't help me much, either. 6171869
Sebastian: And yet you stand here, free. Perhaps He helped you more than you think. 6171872
───────
Fenris: The Maker didn't free me. 6171873
Sebastian: I see you've been thinking about what I said. 6171876
Fenris: I freed myself. If the Maker did anything, He watched. Why should I thank Him for that? 6171879
Sebastian: Is it so hard to believe the Maker cares for you? Maybe He gave you the chance to escape. 6171882
Fenris: It doesn't feel like the Maker cares for me... or anyone. 6171885
Sebastian: We all make our own choices, to do good as well as evil. That is our doing, not the Maker's. 6171888
Fenris: Perhaps. It's... been a long time since I gave it any thought. 6171891
Sebastian: It's not too late to start. 6171894
───────
Sebastian: Were you ever dedicated in the faith of the chantry?
Fenris: I have no memory of my childhood. 6172849
Fenris: Danarius had no desire to teach his slaves anything that made them think they're worthy beings. 6172852
Sebastian: I'm sorry. I can't imagine how difficult your life has been. 6172855
Fenris: No, you can't. 6092303
Sebastian: Whether you were taught it or not, the Maker has room at His side for every soul. Even yours.
───────
Sebastian: You know, when I return to Starkhaven you're welcome to come with me. 6171911
Fenris: And do what, exactly? 6171914
Sebastian: You're a fine warrior. If you could train men to fight like you do, we'd be unstoppable.
Fenris: I'm no leader, and I doubt humans would want me training them. 6171920
Sebastian: Then why not train elves? I bet there's plenty who would admire all you've accomplished. 6171923
Fenris: I... haven't accomplished anything. 6171926
Sebastian: No? You are your own man, living as you see fit—you give yourself too little credit. 6171929
Fenris: You are being kind. 6171932
Sebastian: Not at all. Think about it. 6171935
───────
(Once you complete Repentance)

Sebastian: You know, Fenris, as a brother in the Chantry, I'm allowed to hear confessions. 6172862
Fenris: Why would you tell me this? 6172865
Sebastian: I know Danarius made you do things. I thought you might be more comfortable talking to a friend. 6172868
Sebastian: You should know, a murder committed under duress is a sin on the one who ordered it, not the one whose hands carried out the deed.
Fenris: Have I not spoken enough of my past? Does everyone in Kirkwall wish to hear every sordid detail? 6172874
(If Isabela is in the party)

Isabela: I know I do. 6172877
Sebastian: Sometimes, it's painful to speak. But it's the only way the wound can be lanced. 6172880
───────
Act 3
Sebastian: I saw you at the Chantry last week, Fenris, but I haven't seen you back since.
Fenris: I was only delivering something: you needn't concern yourself.
Sebastian: But you were praying. Or was that part of the delivery? 6171901
Fenris: I was... trying to blend in. 6171904
Sebastian: (Laughs) Oh, yes! You wouldn't want to ruin your reputation.
Fenris: Don't you have a city to re-conquer? 6171910
───────
Fenris: Terrible things do happen, Sebastian. 6172881
Sebastian: But what we see is only a piece of the puzzle. Only the Maker can see the greater picture. 6172884
Fenris: The guilty prosper. Innocents die. 6172893
Sebastian: And then they are brought to the side of the Maker. Their suffering ends. There is always a greater purpose. 6172896
Fenris: Danarius once killed a little boy to fuel blood magic that let him impress his fellow Senators at a party. What was the purpose there? 6172899
Sebastian: Perhaps it was witnessing that which will give you the strength to prevent it ever happening again. 6172902
───────
Sebastian: It's our duty to tell the templars. 6172903
Fenris: Then why haven't you done it? 6172906
Sebastian: I guess I was hoping they'd come to it on their own. 6172909
Fenris: And then you wouldn't have to betray Hawke's friends, right? 6172912
Sebastian: That's not reason enough to allow a maleficar to walk free. 6172918
(If Anders is in the party)

Anders: You think the templars don't know I'm here? They just haven't caught me yet. 6172921
(If Merrill is in the party)

Merrill: Are you talking about me? 6172924
Sebastian: Which of us should do it? Shall we draw lots? 6172927
Fenris: Uh-uh. You want to turn them in, you work it out with Hawke. 6172930
───────
(If Faith has been completed)

Fenris: So that's it? You're not returning to Starkhaven now? 6171936
Sebastian: There are greater things that need to be done, Fenris. 6171939
Fenris: And what about avenging your family? Does that not need to be done? 6171942
Sebastian: What has my vengeance accomplished except to spill more blood? 6171945
Sebastian: No, I must put my faith in the Maker. He will set my path before me. 6171948
Fenris: I can't decide if it is certainty you have, or blindness. 6171951
Sebastian: (Chuckles) At least you can't decide.

Fenris and Varric
Act 1
Fenris: I thought all dwarves had beards. Where's yours? 6143304
Varric: I misplaced it, along with my sense of dwarven pride and my gold-plated noble caste pin. 6143307
Fenris: I thought maybe it fell onto your chest. 6143310
Varric: Oh-ho! The broody elf tells a joke! 6143313
Fenris: I don't brood. 6143316
Varric: Friend, if your brooding were any more impressive, women would swoon as you passed. They'd have broody babies in your honor. 6143319
Fenris: You're a very odd dwarf. 6143322
Varric: And you thought I was joking about the pin. 6143325
───────
Varric: So where's your beard, elf? 6143330
Fenris: Elves don't grow beards. 6143333
Varric: Huh. I thought maybe you'd shaved it off in a fit of broody pique. 6143336
Fenris: So you're a funny dwarf. 6143339
───────
Varric: So, elf. That thing you do with your hand... 6136719
Fenris: I can already tell this isn't going anywhere pleasant. 6169956
Varric: I bet that makes pickpocketing easier. 6169959
Fenris: I'll try it some time and find out. 6169962
───────
Varric: Is brooding a sport in Tevinter? Do they hold competitions? Hand out trophies for the best scowls? 6136720
Fenris: I'm not "brooding."
Varric: Moping, then. You seem like you're a champion at it. 6169978
Fenris: I'm perfectly content at the moment. 6169981
Varric: Oh, so that's you smiling? Glad you clarified that. I'd never have known. 6169984
───────
Act 2
Varric: You know, if you need advice on how to lay low I can give you some. 6143364
Fenris: Being short would make for an excellent start, I suspect. 6143367
Varric: Keep that up, serah, and you can keep on hiding like a rank amateur. 6143370
Fenris: What would you suggest, Varric? Cower in the shadows like a rat? 6143373
Varric: You could try wearing something that didn't scream: "I hate you all, I was a slave!"
Fenris: The markings would still show. 6143379
Varric: Really? Through anything? That's... kind of cool. 6143382
───────
Varric: You really ought to take that offer, elf. It would keep the Coterie off your back pretty much permanently.
Fenris: I don't need employment. 6170044
Varric: But it wouldn't kill you to make some friends in this city. Three years, and you're practically a ghost. 6170047
Fenris: I prefer it that way. 6170050
Varric: Healthy attitude there. Forget I said anything. 6170053
───────
Varric: So what do you do in that gigantic house all day? 6136722
Fenris: Dance, of course. 6170089
Varric: Really? 6112568
Fenris: I run from room to room, choreographing routines. 6170095
Varric: You're actually joking. Alert the Chantry! They need to put this on the calendar! 6170098
Fenris: And you thought I was always serious. 6170101
───────
(If you complete Family Matter)

Fenris: So you found your brother. 6143344
Varric: I did! Wasn't expecting that. 6143347
Fenris: I assume there was a time when you and he were friends? 6143350
Varric: With Bartrand? No, just brothers. Occasionally he wasn't insufferable. 6143353
Fenris: And yet you remained at his side. 6143356
Varric: Too bad he didn't do the same. 6143359
───────
(In front of The Hanged Man)

Fenris: I still don't get the name. Did they hang someone here? 6153428
(If Isabela is in the party)

Isabela: It means being drunk. 6154155
(If Anders is in the party)

Anders: Someone is "hung" if they are drunk, I believe.
Varric: Actually they used to hang men there. By their feet.
Fenris: Well, good thing they were drunk then.
───────
Act 3
Fenris: So who is "Bianca"?
Varric: My crossbow. Say hello, Bianca. 6143390
Fenris: But why Bianca? You must have named her after someone. 6143393
Varric: Nope. Mirabelle was taken. 6143396
Fenris: The way you fondle your weapon is disturbing. 6143399
Varric: Hey! I'm a perfect gentleman. In public. 6143402
───────
Fenris: I notice you hardly ever comment on mages and templars and such. 6143407
Varric: It's a lot of humans in skirts. I get them mixed up. 6143410
Fenris: I highly doubt that. The subject comes up all the time. 6143413
Varric: Tell me about it. 6128819
Fenris: And no opinion? One way or the other? 6143419
Varric: Opinions are like testicles. You kick them hard enough, doesn't matter how many you got. 6143422
Fenris: That's... something. 6143425
───────
Varric: You know you still owe me five sovereigns, elf. 6136723
Fenris: I'm good for it. 6170206
(If Isabela did not leave the party)

Varric: So, you think you can win the coin from Isabela? Good luck with that. 6170234
(Otherwise)

Varric: Meaning you'll borrow it from Hawke, probably.
Varric: Coming to the Hanged Man for Wicked Grace later? 6170237
Fenris: Never miss it. 6170240
───────
(If Hawke romanced Fenris)

Varric: So...you and Hawke?
Fenris: What about us? 6170253
(If Hawke is female)

Varric: I want to make sure I get all the details right when I tell this story. Did you sweep her off her feet or was it the other way around?
(If Hawke is male)

Varric: I want to make sure I get all the details right when I tell this story. Did he sweep you off your feet? I'm assuming he did the sweeping. He's taller than you. Awkward, otherwise.
Fenris: I'm not telling you anything but this: There was no actual sweeping involved. 6170280
Varric: Every little bit helps, elf. 6170283

Isabela and Merrill
Act 1
Merrill: How do you do that? 6136675
Isabela: Do what, Kitten? 6169154
Merrill: You sort of... swagger when you walk. I've been trying, but I trip over my own feet when I do it. 6169157
Isabela: You just strut. It's not something you practice. 6169160
Merrill: How do I learn it, then? 6169163
Isabela: It comes to you. Usually at night. It's like a lover... or maybe a burglar. 6169171
Isabela: Either it ravishes you or runs off with all your jewelry. And you have to run it down and stab it in the heart.
Isabela: And... that metaphor got a bit away from me, didn't it? 6169198
Merrill: I think it did, but it was certainly exciting! 6169201
───────
Merrill: Do you really like sailing? 6156092
Isabela: Like it? I love it! The salt spray on my face, the wind whipping by my ears, the gulls screaming overhead—I love it all. 6156095
Merrill: Don't you get sick? I was so sick on our trip across the sea. 6156098
Isabela: Were you in the hold? 6156101
Merrill: Everyone was in the hold. 6156104
Isabela: There's your problem. You need to be up on deck, under the sky, with nothing between you and the horizon. 6156107
Isabela: Sailing is like sex. Do it wrong, and it'll make you sick. 6156110
Isabela: But do it right, and there's no feeling in the world like it. 6156113
───────
Merrill: Do you have a parrot, Isabela? 6136676
Isabela: What would I want a parrot for? 6169285
Merrill: What about a peg leg? Do you have one of those? 6169288
Isabela: You can see that I don't, dear. 6169291
Merrill: Eye patch? 6169294
Isabela: I'm disappointing you terribly, aren't I? And no hook for a hand, either. 6169297
Merrill: Seems that Varric's pirate stories are awfully inaccurate. 6169300
Isabela: He knows, Kitten. He likes them better that way. 6169303
───────
Isabela: It's not always fun and games on the sea, though. There are storms and hostile pirates. 6156119
Isabela: And it's trying being cooped up with men who haven't seen a woman in months. 6156146
Merrill: You're a woman. 6156149
Isabela: Exactly. And I don't usually let them touch me, so they get... frustrated. 6156152
Isabela: I insist all of them get alone time. Helps with the crankiness. 6156155
Merrill: But they're already lonely! Why would you insist that they be alone some more? 6156158
Isabela: Merrill. 6156161
Merrill: What? Did I miss something? 6156164
Isabela: Go think about it. Maybe it'll come to you. 6156167
───────
(While speaking to Jethann in The Blooming Rose during the quest The First Sacrifice)

Isabela: Ooh, I like him. He reminds me of someone. 6120003
Merrill: He does? Who is it? 6175344
(If Varric is in the party)

Varric: I'll tell you when you're older, Daisy. 6175347
Isabela: Think about it, Kitten. 6175420
Merrill: Well, you couldn't have meant Varric, because he's not even an elf—oh... Ohh! You were referring to yourself. Sorry!
Isabela: See? I knew it'd come to you. 6175426
───────
Act 2
Merrill: (Sighs) Why do you even like me? I must seem so dull.
Isabela: What brought this on? 6156215
Merrill: Your life has been... so exciting. The adventures, the duels, the passionate love affairs. 6156218
Merrill: Compared to that, my life is a stale, dry biscuit. (Sighs) I wish I had your life.
Isabela: No. You don't want my life. 6156224
Merrill: Why? 6062818
Isabela: Because you have a good heart, and you deserve better. 6156230
───────
Merrill: What was Llomerryn like? I've never heard of a Dalish who's been there. 6136677
Isabela: I don't imagine your people travel between islands much. 6169318
Merrill: Not really, no. 6169332
Isabela: I wouldn't start waterproofing your wagons, then. I don't think Llomerryn is ready for the Dalish. 6169336
Merrill: What do you mean? Would we upset the people there? 6169347
Isabela: It's not really the kind of place where one turns down a tumble. Even refuse a fortune teller, and they'd run your lot out of town.
───────
Merrill: How do you suppose the Qunari scratch their heads with those horns in the way? 6136678
Isabela: Why do you think I would know? 6169472
Merrill: Because you know lots of things! I wonder if they rub their heads against tree trunks like halla do. 6169475
Isabela: I'd pay a sovereign to see that. 6169478
Merrill: No wonder they seem so cranky all the time. 6169524
───────
Merrill: You've had many lovers, haven't you? 6156236
Isabela: Fewer than some think. 6156239
Merrill: But you never stay with them. 6156242
Isabela: No, why should I? 6156245
Merrill: But the act of lovemaking is so... intimate. 6156248
Isabela: I don't "make love." What I do is only skin-deep, Kitten.
Isabela: Don't worry your pretty little head about it. 6156254
───────
(If Hawke is romancing Merrill)

Isabela: You and Hawke... something's there, isn't there? 6156173
Merrill: He's clever, strong, and wonderful. How can anyone not love him?
Merrill: She's so amazing and beautiful. How could anyone not love her? (if Hawke is female)
(If Hawke also romanced Isabela:)

Isabela: How could anyone not? 6156182
Merrill: You're very quiet today. Is something wrong? 6156185
Merrill: (Gasps) It's me. I said something wrong, didn't I?
Isabela: No, of course not. You could never say anything wrong.
Isabela: I'm happy for you, Kitten. You've been alone long enough. 6156194
(Otherwise)

Isabela: Oh, I could give you a list, but that might just bore you. 6156197
Isabela: So... did you get naked? 6156200
Merrill: Isabela! 6041492
Isabela: Ooh, look at that blush. That good, huh? 6156206
───────
Act 3
(If Hawke has accepted Isabela's love)

Merrill: I think Hawke likes you, Isabela
Isabela: I certainly hope so! 6169676
Merrill: Of course, it's not surprising at all that anybody would love you, but it's nice to see you two happy.
Isabela: Merrill, sometimes you're so sweet I could eat you for dessert. 6169707
───────
(If Hawke hasn't accepted her love yet)

Merrill: I think Hawke likes you, Isabela.
Isabela: You think so, do you? 6169677
Merrill: S/he looks at you all the time, and then s/he looks embarrassed and pretends s/he's busy with something else.
Hawke: I can hear you, you know. 6169714
Merrill: (Giggles) See?
Isabela: Hmm. I'll have to think about that... 6169720
───────
Merrill: Do you think you'll leave Kirkwall someday?
(If Hawke has romanced Isabela)

Isabela: I might if I can persuade the right person to come away with me. 6169738
(If not)

Isabela: Of course I will! As soon as I get myself a ship, I'm sailing wherever the sea takes me. 6169741
Merrill: I'll miss you. You'll write to me, won't you? Do pirates write letters? 6169744
Isabela: Badly. Hook hands make for awful pennmanship, Kitten.
───────
(If No Rest for the Wicked & Questioning Beliefs have been completed and Hawke accepted Isabela's love)

Merrill: Why are you smiling? 6156260
Isabela: No reason. 6156263
Merrill: Ooh, ooh! It's something dirty, isn't it? Tell me, tell me! 6156266
Isabela: It... it isn't anything dirty. I'm just... happy. 6156269
Merrill: Oh. That's good, too, but I was hoping for something dirty. 6156272
Isabela: Come by the tavern later. I've got stories that will make your toes curl. 6156275

Isabela and Sebastian
Act 2
Sebastian: Is this getting you any closer to your ship? 6172934
Isabela: Huh? 6062690
Sebastian: I just... don't understand why you're working with Hawke. You don't seem to care about anything we do. 6172940
Sebastian: What's keeping you here? 6172943
(If Hawke and Isabela have slept together)

Isabela: Mostly the sex. Hawke is an absolute tiger between the sheets. I mean all night, every night.
Isabela: Oh cute! You're blushing.
(If not)

Isabela: Mostly the Blooming Rose. I'm paid up through the end of the year. I'd hate not to use it. 6172953
Sebastian: The... brothel? 6172956
Isabela: What? Women can't go to brothels, too? You're just not using your imagination. 6172959
Isabela: Oh, look! Now you are. You're cute when you're blushing. 6172962
───────
Sebastian: I notice you talk about... vulgar things quite a bit. 6173314
Isabela: Do you want me to stop? Do I make you... uncomfortable? 6173317
Sebastian: It was just an observation, really. 6173320
Isabela: It's a bad habit I picked up, spending years with foul-mouthed pirates. 6173323
Isabela: Pirates only care about a small number of very specific things: the sea, strong drink, and booty. Both kinds. 6173326
───────
Sebastian: I used to be like you, you know. 6172963
Isabela: You used to be a woman? 6172966
Sebastian: No! 6001013
Isabela: That explains a lot. 6172972
Sebastian: My family put me in the Chantry because I was giving them a bad name. 6172975
Sebastian: It was the best thing that ever happened to me. I found peace. I found a purpose. 6172978
Sebastian: Before I came here, I used to be out to all hours, drinking and whoring. I didn't believe in anything except my own pleasure. 6172981
Isabela: Why couldn't I have met you then? 6172984
───────
Isabela: All right, let's just get this over with. 6173330
Sebastian: A duel? 6075289
Isabela: No, the sermon. The finger-wagging, the guilt-trips, telling me how an unexamined life isn't worth living. 6173336
Sebastian: I wasn't going to— 6173339
Isabela: You weren't? You weren't going to tell me to comfort the needy and give freely of myself? 6173342
Sebastian: From what I hear, you already give yourself quite freely. 6173345
Isabela: Ooh. You got me there. 6173348
───────
Act 3

Sebastian: That was very brave, coming back to face the Qunari. 6172985
Isabela: It was idiotic. They would have killed me.
Sebastian: And you returned anyway. You couldn't face the thought of so many innocents dying for something you could prevent. 6172991
Isabela: Tell that to the viscount. 6172994
Sebastian: It's frightening, isn't it, to realize you have the potential to be a better person? 6172997
───────
Sebastian: You've been watching me all day. It's getting a little... distracting. 6173352
Isabela: Merrill's right. Your armor is shiny. I can see myself in it. Look! 6173355
Isabela: Shit. Oh, shit. Is that a wrinkle? Is that a wrinkle between my brows? 6173358
Sebastian: Um. I don't see— 6173361
Isabela: Hold still! 6173364
───────
Isabela: So, I've never understood why the Chantry says if you're good, you'll be taken up to the Maker's side. 6173007
Sebastian: Those who die with the sins cleansed from their souls will walk beside the Maker in eternity. 6173010
Isabela: That doesn't sound fun! 6173013
Isabela: If they really want people to be good, shouldn't they offer an afterlife with... lakes of wine and a dozen naked virgins? 6173016
Sebastian: Anyone who wants that will be going to the Void. 6173019
Isabela: Sounds like that's where all the good parties will be. 6173022
───────
Isabela: It's been years, and not once have you tried to get me to repent or turn to the Maker. 6173371
Sebastian: Preaching seldom works, Isabela. To change a person's heart, one has to lead by example. 6173374
Isabela: Huh. That makes sense. I can respect that. 6173377
Sebastian: I grew weary of the strings of nameless lovers and the nights full of mindless pleasure. You will, too. 6173380
Isabela: (Gasps) That's the cruelest thing anyone's ever said to me!
Isabela: I think I'm going to cry. 6173386

Isabela and Varric
Act 1

Varric: I shit you not, Rivaini, it was this big. 6164685
Isabela: There's no way. Impossible! I've had hundreds of those in my hands, and they're never that size. 6164688
Varric: Would I lie about something so critical? 6164691
(Next line is dependent on third party member)

Anders: I can't stand it anymore—what are you two talking about? 6164694
Aveline: I'm afraid to ask, but... what are you two going on about? 6164697
Carver: What is wrong with you two? Can't you ever have a conversation that isn't dirty? 6164700
Hawke: What are you two talking about? 6164008
Varric: We're discussing knives, of course. Well, daggers, technically. I never remember the difference. 6164706
Varric: Why? What did you think we were talking about?
───────
Varric: Rivaini, stop looking at my chest. My eyes are up here. 6155955
Isabela: But the chest hair... 6155958
Varric: Do you know how much I suffer under your gaze? I am a person, not an object! 6155961
Isabela: Uh, Varric? 6155964
Varric: (Laughs) Just shitting you.
───────
Varric: You know, Rivaini, you promised me you'd tell me how your ship wrecked. 6136729
Isabela: I was drunk. I thought the reefs around the Wounded Coast were made of candy. 6170002
Varric: Oh, come on. 6170005
Isabela: And a demon told me to do it. It bet me sixty sovereigns and a bottle of port. 6170008
Isabela: You're not the only one here who can bullshit, you know. 6170011
───────
Varric: I'll let you run your fingers through it, if you want. 6155973
Isabela: Your chest hair? My fingers? Oh, Varric, stop! You're making me quiver. 6155976
Varric: You know you want to. 6155979
Isabela: Oh, I do... I can't resist you. No woman can. 6155982
Varric: I know. It's a terrible burden. 6155985
───────
Act 2

Varric: Were you listening to that guy in the Hanged Man last night? 6136730
Isabela: "Your eyes are like bumblebees, flying into the window of my soul." (Laughs)
Varric: My favorite was, "Your lips are like the wings of sparrows. Red ones. With no feathers."
Isabela: "Oh, speak! And send the plucked wings of your lips soaring."
Varric: I'd buy the guy a drink, but I don't think he needs one. 6170437
───────
Varric: You have got to tell me what was in that box, Rivaini. 6136732
Isabela: Which box? I've opened so many... 6170482
Varric: Well, those too. But later. Right now: that Qunari relic. 6170485
Isabela: I'll make you a deal: I'll tell you what was in that box if you tell me how Bianca got her name. 6170488
Varric: Fine, forget I asked. Evil woman. 6170491
───────
Isabela: Come to me, and I'll take you to places you've never been... 6155991
Varric: Isabela... Are you talking to Bianca? 6155994
Isabela: I think she deserves to feel a woman's touch on her trigger, don't you? 6155997
Varric: Bianca responds to my touch. She'd never give it up for you. 6156000
Isabela: That's what they always say, and I always prove them wrong. 6156003
Varric: Stop it. You're confusing her. And me. 6156006
───────
(If you complete The Long Road)

Isabela: Psst. I've got some of it written down now. 6156012
Varric: Give it here. 6156015
Varric: "Her breasts strained against the leather jerkin like two wild stallions corralled against their will." (Chuckles)
Varric: "She pounced—the smooth moves of a jungle cat—and locked her thighs around Donnic's waist. He—"
(If Aveline is in the party)

Aveline: What? 6015974
Isabela: Nothing. 6051273
Aveline: What is that? 6001219
Isabela: Shh! (Giggles)
Varric: Isabela just thought she'd celebrate your love affair with a... written dedication. 6156036
Isabela: It's "friend-fiction!" I do it out of love.
Aveline: I will never, ever be clean again. 6156042
(If not)

Isabela: Maybe you should read the rest of it in private. 6156045
Varric: I think that's best. 6156048
───────
Act 3

Isabela: Varric, how does one get made a Paragon? 6156054
Varric: The Assembly votes on it. Enough votes, and—BAM!—you're a living God!
Isabela: You should ask to be made a Paragon. Of manliness. 6156060
Varric: I like the way you think, Rivaini, but one doesn't just ask to be made a Paragon. 6156063
Isabela: Why not? Everyone can see you're a paragon of manliness. It's just a matter of making it official. 6156066
───────
Varric: After all this, the life of a pirate is going to be dull, isn't it?
Isabela: I know! I'll have to steal myself another Qunari relic. 6156081
Varric: The scary thing is, I don't know if you're joking!
Isabela: Of course I'm joking. I'm not getting involved with those people again. 6171603
Isabela: No... this time, I'll steal the Queen of Antiva. There's no way that could go wrong.
───────
(If Hawke romances Merrill)

Varric: So, Hawke and Daisy.
Isabela: I think they're darling together. 6170463
(If Hawke previously slept with Isabela)

Varric: Really? You're not at all jealous? Because I thought you and Hawke...
Isabela: Hawke was just a dalliance. You know I've still got my eye on you. 6170469
Varric: Keep dreaming, Rivaini. 6170472
(Otherwise)

Varric: It's almost too adorable. Well, except for the evil blood magic thing. 6170473
Isabela: The most evil thing Merrill does most days is pick the flowers out of other people's gardens. 6170476
Varric: I know, I have to bribe most of the gardeners in Hightown to keep it quiet.
───────
(During The Last Straw after choosing sides)

Varric: Just curious, does any of this make sense to you? 6136733
Isabela: What? This whole "everyone's waiting for the world to end" thing?
Varric: That, yes. 6168773
Isabela: Not remotely. 6168776
Varric: Good. It's not just me, then. 6168779

Merrill and Sebastian
Act 2

Sebastian: Have you heard the Chant of Light? 6173026
Merrill: That's the song they sing at the Chantry, right? It's pretty... but a little repetitive.
Sebastian: Then you know the story? How Andraste became the Maker's divine bride and convinced Him to offer us a second chance? 6173032
Merrill: Right. But I never understood why she had to die. 6173035
Sebastian: Her mortal husband betrayed her out of jealousy. 6173038
Merrill: But if He wanted her to spread her faith, couldn't she do that better alive? 6173041
Sebastian: The Maker gave us free will. By his betrayal, Maferath showed us that men were not yet worth saving.
Merrill: I don't know. It's a nice story, but I think it's got some holes. 6173047
───────
Merrill: Your armor is very shiny, Sebastian. Doesn't that make you an easier target? 6167870
Sebastian: The Light of the Maker is my armor, Merrill. I am not afraid. 6169453
Merrill: Maybe you could ask Him to make His Light less shiny? Then you wouldn't need as much armor. 6169458
───────
Merrill: If your city was stolen, why didn't you just call the guards? 6167871
Sebastian: I'm afraid the matter can't be handled by guards, Merrill. 6169750
Merrill: Aveline could help you! She's very good at making thieves give things back. I think it's because she's so tall. 6169753
Sebastian: This is beyond even Aveline's power, I'm sorry to say. 6169761
Merrill: Are you sure? Have you seen her hit people? 6169764
(If Aveline is in the party)

Aveline: I can hear every word you're saying. 6169767
───────
Sebastian: So what do you believe, Merrill?
Merrill: Our gods abandoned us long ago. They haven't answered our prayers since the fall of Arlathan. 6173051
Merrill: When we've proven that we're elves again, that we didn't lose everything, they'll come back to us. 6173054
Sebastian: We say the same of the Maker. 6173057
Sebastian: Perhaps they're only different names for the same divine force that created the world. 6173060
Merrill: The Maker wants you to be elves? 6173063
───────
Act 3

Merrill: I've always wondered: how do your Divines choose their names? 6167872
Sebastian: They write all the best sacred names on slips of paper and stuff them in a miter. 6169885
Sebastian: Then the newly elected Divine picks a name out of the hat. 6169888
Merrill: What if she picks a name she doesn't like? Does she have to keep it? 6170163
Sebastian: Of course she does. How do you think we got four Divines named Hortensia? 6170166
───────
Merrill: Does your bow have a name? Varric's bow has a name. 6167873
Sebastian: I'm afraid I can't compete with our dear dwarf's... relationship to his weapon. 6170194
Merrill: You could call it Philomela! 6170197
Sebastian: Why would I do that? 6147143
Merrill: Because it reminds me of a woman in the alienage. Skinny, pointed, and always throwing things at people. 6170203
───────
Merrill: What does your Chantry do? 6173076
Merrill: I mean, you keep saying how great it is. Anders and Isabela tell me to stay away from it. But what does it do? 6173079
Merrill: Among the Dalish, the Keepers teach the children, preserve our history, perform magic. The priestesses here just... sing. 6173082
Sebastian: The Chantry does many charitable works. It cares for widows and orphans— 6173085
Merrill: Who in the Dalish would just be part of the clan, like everyone else. 6173088
Merrill: I just don't get it. 6179315
───────
(After completing A New Path)

Sebastian: You need to seek atonement. 6173089
Merrill: I know I should've died there, not Marethari. Don't you think I feel guilty enough?
Sebastian: Guilt isn't a punishment. It's a reminder of the things you haven't set right.
Sebastian: The only way to shed its burden is to repent with a sincere heart and to rectify your failings.
Merrill: But how? 6173101
Merrill: The Keeper is dead, my clan lost everything because of me.
Merrill: There's not enough I can do in this lifetime to make up for that. 6173110
Sebastian: It was your pride that led you to the demon. Admitting what you can't do is a good first step. 6173113

Merrill and Varric
Act 1

Merrill: I've never met a dwarf before. 6136684
Varric: That's because you spend too much time frolicking in the woods, Daisy. Dwarves don't frolic.
Merrill: Dalish don't really frolic, either. Not in the woods anyway.
Varric: You have sanctioned frolicking areas? 6169778
Merrill: No, just not in the woods. The trees get jealous. 6169781
Varric: But you do frolic? 6169784
Merrill: Of course we do! We wouldn't be elves, otherwise. 6169787
───────

Merrill: You remind me of Hahren Paivel, Varric. Only younger. And shorter. And not as serious. 6136685
Varric: So it's a close resemblance, then. 6169791
Merrill: Well, he tells stories. And you tell stories. Although none of his begin, "No shit, there I was."
Varric: I'll have to give him some better stories, then. 6169797
───────

(After you speak to Merrill in her home for the first time)

Merrill: Thank you very much for the help earlier, Varric!
Varric: You made it back to the Alienage in one piece, then?
Merrill: I don't know how I wound up in Darktown. There are just too many corners in Kirkwall. 6170501
Varric: Still got that ball of twine? 6170504
Merrill: I left it at my house. Don't worry! I won't get lost while we're following Hawke. 6170507
Varric: Bring it next time, Daisy. Just in case. 6170510
───────

Varric: Daisy, for my sake, please quit cutting through the alleys in Lowtown alone at night. 6136738
Merrill: Nothing ever happens. I'm perfectly safe, Varric. 6170699
Varric: Yes, I know. And that nothing is costing me a fortune. 6170702
───────

Act 2

Varric: So, I hear you've been visiting the viscount's garden, Daisy.
Merrill: They're enormous! And they're always empty. Why don't more people go to see them? 6170705
Varric: Probably because they're private and surrounded by guards. 6170708
Merrill: I thought all those men looked a bit cross. 6170711
───────

Merrill: Bianca is a very pretty name. 6136686
Varric: I'll tell her you said so, Daisy. 6169800
Merrill: She can't actually hear you, can she? 6169803
Varric: Of course she can. What kind of a question is that? 6169813
Merrill: Wait, are we talking about your crossbow or something else now? 6169816
───────

(If you complete Family Matter)

Merrill: I'm sorry about your brother, Varric. Have you any other family? 6136687
Varric: (Snorts) I have family like a rat has fleas, Daisy.
Merrill: Does that mean you have a lot of family, or that they make you itch a lot? 6169822
Varric: Both. 6169825
(Alternatively)

Varric: I'm sure any priest who would pray for Bartrand would burst into flames.
Merrill: Oh, I didn't know priesthood was so dangerous.
Varric: Don't worry Daisy, the chantry keeps a lot of water on hand.
───────

(If you complete Mirror Image)

Varric: Why a mirror? 6136740
Merrill: I don't understand the question. 6170724
Varric: If your people were going to make a magical whatever for talking to each other, why choose a mirror? 6170727
Varric: Do elves spend a lot of time talking to their own reflections? 6170730
Merrill: I suppose the ancient elves would have felt silly talking to a wardrobe or an urn. 6170733
───────

(If Isabela is gone at the end of Act 2)

Merrill: Do you ever miss her? 6169844
Varric: Isabela? Of course I do. 6169847
Merrill: You call her by her name! I've never heard you do that before.
Varric: No fun in calling her Rivaini if she's not here to be annoyed by it. 6169853
───────

Act 3

Merrill: You should have this back. 6136741
Varric: Twine? When did I loan you a ball of twine? 6170749
Merrill: You gave it to me when I first moved here when I kept getting lost in Lowtown. 6170752
Merrill: It drove the merchants in the market completely batty, but it did help me find my way. 6170755
Varric: Keep it, Daisy. 6170758
Merrill: I don't think I'll be getting lost again anytime soon. 6170761
Varric: You never know. You might need to tie a package up, hang a lantern, dress a roast chicken. It's multipurpose.
───────

Merrill: Is there a story behind Bianca? 6136688
Varric: There's a story behind everything, Daisy. 6169828
Merrill: So tell me! 6169856
Varric: I can't. 6169859
Merrill: Why not? 6028809
Varric: There was a girl, and I made a promise. Bianca is the only story I can never tell. 6169865
Merrill: You can't say that! Now I want to know even more! 6169868
Varric: That was the idea, Daisy. 6169871
───────

(During A New Path)

Varric: Does anybody else get the feeling that this is going to end badly? Just me huh?
Merrill: It's not all bad Varric, think of the stories you'll be able to tell later.
Varric: No offense Daisy, but I could live without telling anyone that we murdered you on some mountain side, it's little hard to made that one sound good.
───────

(During A New Path)

Varric: Who thought putting a demon in a cave on Sundermount was a good idea in the first place? 6142845
Merrill: Where would you have put him? 6142901
Varric: Tevinter maybe? Or in the Anderfels? Further away from Kirkwall that's for sure.
───────


Merrill: How do you do it, living in the city without picking a side? Doesn't it matter to you?
Varric: Of course it does. That's why I don't take sides. 6170771
Merrill: That doesn't make any sense. 6170774
Varric: I've got you and Aveline, Fenris and Anders. Hawke. Isabela. 6170777
Varric: I've got friends in the Circle and drinking buddies in the templars. All of them matter. 6170780
Merrill: But you're going to fight. If it comes to that, I mean. 6170783
Varric: I fought my own brother, Daisy. Nobody said this was going to be happy story.
───────

(During The Last Straw)

Merrill: Varric, how does the story end? 6136689
Varric: Which story, Daisy? 6169831
Merrill: The big one. With us and Hawke, the mages and templars. Everything.
Varric: You want to know before it happens? You're not worried about spoiling the surprise? 6169837
Merrill: I might not see it end. 6169840
Varric: You have to stick with us if you want to find out how it turns out, Daisy.

Sebastian and Varric
Act 2

Sebastian: It's been very exciting working with Hawke. 6173117
Varric: Are you for real? 6173120
Sebastian:
(If Hawke is male) It seems like he's involved every time there's a crisis in Kirkwall.
(If Hawke is female) It seems like she's involved every time something goes wrong in Kirkwall.
Sebastian: I've never had so many opportunities to help people! 6173129
Varric: All right. I thought I was getting tired of moody. I take it back. 6173132
Varric: You're making my teeth ache. 6173135
───────

Varric: So, Choir Boy, this usurper of yours is... twenty feet tall? 6167877
Sebastian: Not even close, no. 6170113
Varric: But he has claws for hands, right? 6170116
Sebastian: Fingers. Perfectly normal ones. If a little fat, perhaps. 6170119
Varric: He eats babies, though. And farts fire. 6170122
Sebastian: You're not serious, I hope. 6170125
Varric: You can't even pretend to be interesting, can you? 6170128
───────

Sebastian: You must forgive your brother. 6173136
Varric: While you were off playing prince, Bartrand trapped us in the Deep Roads and left us to die. 6173139
Sebastian: When you hold onto anger, it colors everything you do. 6173142
Sebastian: You escaped the Deep Roads. You built a life without your brother. Do you still want him haunting you? 6173145
Varric: Oh, go find some beggars to sing to, will you? 6173148
───────

Varric: Tell us about Starkhaven, Choir Boy. I'm sure we're all burning with curiosity about your far-away land. 6167878
Sebastian: "My far-away land?" It's inland Free Marches, not on the moon.
Varric: And here I was hoping... 6170149
Sebastian: It's a lot like here. But fewer dead people. 6170152
Varric: Well, you don't have Hawke. 6173277
───────

Act 3

Varric: I've heard rumors about Starkhaven, you know. 6167879
Varric: They say you eat the dead up there. And murder strangers in the street. 6170286
Sebastian: Why do I suspect that when you say you've "heard" rumors, you mean you've invented some?
Varric: Six of one, half-dozen of another. 6170292
───────

Varric: You know, Choir Boy, I wouldn't normally say this, but—the shiny white armor? It works for you. 6167880
Sebastian: That's uncharacteristically kind of you, Varric. 6170424
Varric: Makes you look like a lacquered pilot whale. 6170427
Sebastian: Ah, now that was much more in-character. 6170430
───────

Sebastian: You know, if you have time, I could give you a few archery pointers. 6173149
Varric: Excuse me? 6120857
Sebastian: Sometimes your shots veer a little left, I thought maybe your cocking ring was off.
Sebastian: I could take a look if you like. 6173158
Varric: You want to touch Bianca's cocking ring? 6173161
Sebastian: It was just a thought. 6173164
───────

Varric: So, I've known you for three years now. I give up. You beat me. What is it? 6173165
Varric: You like boys? Sheep? You slept with your sister? 6173171
Sebastian: What are you talking about? 6000960
Varric: What are you hiding? Nobody's this bloody clean. 6173177
Varric: After you leave the chantry you... get drunk at the Hanged Man and walk around in women's clothes? 6173180
(If Isabela is in the party)

Isabela: Not that I've seen. Unfortunately. 6173183
Sebastian: I've been honest with you and Hawke. 6173186
Varric: Liar. 6173189
Sebastian: Lying is a sin. 6173192
